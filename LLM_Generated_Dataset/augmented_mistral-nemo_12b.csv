6,Therapist,"Hi, Sal. Thanks for taking the time to be here today.",false
6,Client,No problem.,false
6,Therapist,I noticed your doctor referred you and appreciate you making the effort to come in.,false
6,Client,"It's a bit of an inconvenience, but I'm here now.",false
6,Therapist,Can you share what you understand about why your doctor suggested this appointment?,false
6,Client,"Something about changing my life more. They want me to cut down drinking, smoking, even get rid of Oscar, my dog. It's all overwhelming.",false
6,Therapist,"It sounds like there's a lot going on, Sal. Your asthma, stress, and these lifestyle changes.",false
6,Client,"Yeah, it feels like everything's spiraling.",false
6,Therapist,We have about 15-20 minutes together. Let's take a moment to list what's happening for you. Which would you find most helpful to focus on?,false
6,Client,"Everything feels chaotic, but I guess we should start somewhere.",false
6,Therapist,We'll use an agenda-setting worksheet to organize thoughts. Nothing has to change just yet; it's about understanding your situation better.,false
6,Client,"Okay, as long as I'm not committing to anything.",false
6,Therapist,Great. Let's list what others suggest you change or work on. Your asthma is one?,false
6,Client,"Yes, and they want me to give up Oscar, my dog. That's stressful; he's been with me longer than my wife.",false
6,Therapist,It must be upsetting to consider giving up your dog.,false
6,Client,"Yeah, it's a big stressor. And I'm trying to cut down smoking too.",false
6,Therapist,"So, asthma, dog, and smoking are high on your list?",false
6,Client,"Yes, and money's tight with my wife on maternity leave. Appointments take time off work too.",false
6,Therapist,"Those are interconnected issues, Sal.",false
6,Client,"Yeah, it's all connected somehow.",false
6,Therapist,"If you could pick two top priorities for today, what would they be?",false
6,Client,The thoughts about Oscar and managing my asthma better.,false
6,Therapist,Okay. Those seem related. Let's start with those.,false
3,Therapist,"It sounds like your wife has been encouraging you to focus on your health lately, and it seems this has been causing some tension between you two. Can you tell me more about that?",false
3,Client,"Yeah, well, she's always on my case about improving my habits, but I don't really see what the issue is. I work hard all day, sometimes I can't make it home for dinner, so I grab a bite at places like Applebee's. It's not a big deal, right?",false
3,Therapist,"I see. So, you feel that your current lifestyle isn't negatively impacting your health in any way?",false
3,Client,"That's right. I mean, my job is physically demanding, and I'm sweating out all the bad stuff anyway.",false
3,Therapist,Have you noticed any changes in your weight or how your clothes fit recently?,false
3,Client,"A little bit, but nothing too significant. I'm not feeling bloated or anything.",false
3,Therapist,I see. When was the last time you had a check-up with your doctor?,false
3,Client,Last year for my annual physical. Everything checked out fine then.,false
3,Therapist,"That's good to know. It sounds like you feel confident in your current health status, but your wife might have some valid concerns as well?",false
3,Client,"Yeah, I know she just wants what's best for me, but sometimes it feels like she's overreacting. After a long day at work, it's nice to treat myself once in a while.",false
3,Therapist,"I understand. Would you be open to learning more about the potential risks associated with obesity and diabetes, so you can make informed decisions about your health?",false
3,Client,"Sure, that sounds helpful.",false
12,Therapist,"Sarah, I'm really glad you could make it for your well-woman exam today. We've covered a lot of ground, and now I'd like to explore more about your smoking habits, if that's okay with you?",false
12,Client,"Yeah, sure.",false
12,Therapist,Great. Could you tell me roughly how many cigarettes you smoke in a day? You mentioned it had increased recently.,false
12,Client,"Yeah, so like once in the morning, once during lunch, and then maybe five or six in the evenings.",false
12,Therapist,"I see. So about eight cigarettes daily, which is just under half a pack. When did this increase start?",false
12,Client,"Um, over the past year, I guess. It's been more in the evenings since my son goes to bed.",false
12,Therapist,I understand. That time of day can be stressful with your busy schedule. You mentioned you work full-time and are also taking night classes.,false
12,Client,"Yeah, it's a lot. I just need that time to unwind.",false
12,Therapist,"Of course. Apart from smoking, do you have other ways to relax in the evenings?",false
12,Client,Sometimes I'll have a drink or two.,false
12,Therapist,"I see. On average, how many drinks would you say you have daily and weekly?",false
12,Client,"Maybe two max daily. But why does this matter? I'm here for my regular check-up, not to discuss my drinking habits.",false
12,Therapist,"Sarah, I understand your concern. My role is to provide information and listen to your thoughts without judgment. We want to ensure you're aware of all health resources available to you, including those related to smoking and alcohol consumption.",false
12,Client,"Okay, fine.",false
12,Therapist,"Great. Let's talk about the health risks associated with increased smoking and alcohol use. These include various cancers like colon, cervical, breast, lung, and pancreatic, as well as liver disease, heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension.",false
12,Client,"Wow, I didn't realize it was that serious.",false
12,Therapist,"It can be. But remember, we're here to discuss your thoughts and goals. On a scale of 0-10, how ready are you to quit smoking?",false
12,Client,"Um, maybe a five? I'm not fully ready yet.",false
12,Therapist,That's okay. What makes it a five rather than a four for you?,false
12,Client,"Well, you mentioned the cancer risks and being a mother... It's scary.",false
12,Therapist,"I understand. Given these health concerns and your goals, where do you see yourself in considering change? What steps could move you closer to a 10 on that readiness scale?",false
12,Client,Maybe cutting back in the evenings? Like smoking three instead of five or six?,false
12,Therapist,"That's a significant reduction. Let's meet again in four weeks to review this plan and your lab results, okay?",false
12,Client,"Yeah, sure.",false
12,Therapist,Great. I have some helpful resources on smoking cessation here. Would you like them?,false
12,Client,"Yes, please.",false
12,Therapist,"Also, would you consider speaking with Dr. Kirtley about stress management and alcohol use? He's an expert in this area.",false
12,Client,Maybe just the stress part for now. I'm not sure about discussing my drinking habits.,false
12,Therapist,"Understood. We'll schedule both appointments before you leave today. Any other questions, Sarah?",false
12,Client,Nope.,false
12,Therapist,It was nice meeting you. See you in a month.,false
24,Therapist,Welcome. How can I assist you today?,false
24,Client,"Hi, I hope you can help me. My workplace just went smoke-free and... I'm not thrilled about it. I still want to keep smoking, but I was wondering if there's anything that could help me cope with the day-to-day changes.",false
24,Therapist,"I see. Your workplace has become smoke-free, and this change is causing some distress for you. You're not ready to quit smoking just yet, but you're looking for ways to manage the transition.",false
24,Client,"Yeah, exactly. I mean, I've been smoking for about five years now, and it's a part of my routine. I don't want to give it up, but I'm curious about what options I have.",false
24,Therapist,Let's explore that together. Can you tell me more about how smoking fits into your daily life?,false
24,Client,"Well, I smoke less than a pack a day, mostly on breaks at work, in the mornings, and after work. It helps me relax. But I don't want to quit just yet.",false
24,Therapist,"So smoking is currently an important part of your life, and you're not ready to change that, but if you did decide to quit someday, you feel confident about your ability to do so.",false
24,Client,"Yes, that's right. I could quit if I wanted to, but I don't want to just yet.",false
24,Therapist,"I understand. On a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is not considering quitting at all and 10 is ready to quit, where would you place yourself?",false
24,Client,"Probably a two. I haven't really thought about quitting until today, but now that it's on my mind, maybe I could be convinced.",false
24,Therapist,"It sounds like you're open to the idea of change, even if it's not your immediate goal. There are indeed products available that can help curb nicotine cravings and manage withdrawal symptoms.",false
24,Client,"That's good to know. I'm not ready to do anything today, but it's helpful to have options if I ever decide to quit.",false
24,Therapist,"Absolutely. Now, what might make you more open to the idea of quitting in the future? You mentioned earlier that you're a two on the readiness scale. What could move you up to a four or five?",false
24,Client,"I guess if one of my friends decided to quit with me, that would help. But none of them are planning to quit anytime soon.",false
24,Therapist,It's possible that some of your coworkers might be considering quitting now that the workplace is smoke-free. That could provide some social support for you as well.,false
24,Client,"You're right, I hadn't thought about that. Thanks for bringing it up.",false
24,Therapist,"Of course. Today seems to be more about gathering information for you. When you're ready to explore products or strategies further, just let me know.",false
24,Client,"Okay, thank you. I appreciate your help today.",false
21,Therapist,"Hi, Laura. Welcome.",false
21,Client,Hi.,false
21,Therapist,"Thanks for joining me today. Let's briefly discuss what we'll be doing here. I'm here to understand your goals and aspirations better, explore some behaviors you might engage in, and see how I can support you. It's not my role to judge or change you; I'm here to listen and help you navigate your life.",false
21,Client,Okay.,false
21,Therapist,Let's start by you telling me a bit about yourself.,false
21,Client,"Hi, I'm Laura, 17 years old, senior in high school. I hope to go to college and study pre-law.",false
21,Therapist,That sounds like an exciting plan. What do you enjoy doing for fun?,false
21,Client,"On weekends, I hang out with friends, sometimes at parties or social events. I don't drink much, maybe one or two drinks max.",false
21,Therapist,I see. How does alcohol fit into your social scene?,false
21,Client,"Well, I might have a drink to blend in, but I'm not really interested in getting drunk. I've seen others have negative experiences with it.",false
21,Therapist,I understand. It sounds like you're being mindful about your drinking.,false
21,Therapist,How important is it for you to make adjustments to your drinking habits?,false
21,Client,"On a scale of 1-10, maybe a 5 or 6. It's not something I think about constantly, but I'm aware of it.",false
21,Therapist,Got it. And how confident are you that you could make changes if you wanted to?,false
21,Client,"An 8 or 9 out of 10. I don't drink much now, so it wouldn't be difficult for me to stop.",false
21,Therapist,That's great to hear. Let's set a goal for today. How about trying not to drink at the next party you attend?,false
21,Client,"Sure, that sounds doable.",false
21,Therapist,What benefits do you see from following through with this goal?,false
21,Client,"I'll have all my senses and be aware of everything happening. Plus, it's healthier for me.",false
21,Therapist,Those are excellent points. Let's meet again in a few weeks to check in on how it goes. Sound good?,false
21,Client,"Yes, that works.",false
21,Therapist,Great. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss or any questions you have?,false
21,Client,"No, I'm good for now.",false
21,Therapist,"All right then. Thanks for coming in today, Laura. Let's stay in touch.",false
21,Client,Thank you. Bye.,false
36,Therapist,"Good morning, Barbara Roberts?",false
36,Client,"Yes, good morning.",false
36,Therapist,"Hello, I'm Dr. Betty, one of the new GPs here. To start, could you please tell me how you'd like me to address you?",false
36,Client,"Please call me Barbara, thank you.",false
36,Therapist,"Thank you, Barbara. I understand that Dr. Brown is usually your GP. Could you tell me why you've come to see me today?",false
36,Client,"Well, I've been having terrible stomach problems for some time now. Dr. Brown hasn't been able to get to the bottom of it, so I thought perhaps you could help.",false
36,Therapist,I see. Can you share more about these stomach issues you're experiencing?,false
36,Client,"Yes, I have constant discomfort, bloating, alternating constipation and diarrhea, cramping, stabbing pains, and I pass very smelly wind often.",false
36,Therapist,"That sounds quite troublesome, Barbara. How long have you been dealing with these symptoms?",false
36,Client,It started about four years ago after a holiday in Egypt where I had severe diarrhea. My stomach hasn't been right since then.,false
36,Therapist,I see. And what treatments have you tried so far for these symptoms?,false
36,Client,"Dr. Brown prescribed muscle relaxants initially, but I've also tried various herbal remedies from the health shop. I always carry Imodium with me too.",false
36,Therapist,"I understand. Now, Barbara, how are these stomach problems affecting your daily life?",false
36,Client,"It's had a big impact. I went from full-time to part-time work due to discomfort, and eventually, I had to stop working altogether about a year ago. I also stopped going to exercise classes and socializing with friends as much.",false
36,Therapist,That sounds like quite a significant change in your lifestyle. Have there been any times when your symptoms improved or felt better?,false
36,Client,"Last summer, my son got married, and surprisingly, my stomach was fine during that time. But generally, I've noticed my symptoms worsen when my husband is away for work.",false
36,Therapist,"That's interesting to note. Now, Barbara, what do you think might be causing your stomach problems? Have you had any thoughts about this?",false
36,Client,"Sometimes I worry it could be an infection that hasn't cleared up or maybe IBS. Other times, I fear it might be something more serious like cancer.",false
36,Therapist,"It's understandable that you're concerned about these possibilities. But based on what we know so far, do you think there might be a connection between your symptoms and how you're feeling emotionally or the changes in your lifestyle?",false
36,Client,I don't see how my mind could cause this much pain.,false
36,Therapist,"I'm not suggesting the pain is all in your mind, Barbara. But sometimes physical symptoms can be influenced by our emotions and life circumstances. Would you be open to exploring this idea further over the next few months?",false
36,Client,That sounds like a long time if there's something seriously wrong.,false
36,Therapist,"I understand your concern, but if we work together regularly, we can monitor your symptoms closely. If they change or worsen, we'll investigate further. But if they stay the same, it will give us reassurance that nothing new is developing.",false
36,Client,"Okay, so you're saying I should come back and see you next week to discuss this further?",false
36,Therapist,"Yes, that would be a good start. We can book a double slot for next week, and please bring or make a list of all the tablets you're currently taking. This will help us review them together.",false
36,Client,"All right, I'll make an appointment for next week and bring my tablet list.",false
36,Therapist,"Thank you, Barbara. Until then, take care.",false
36,Client,You too. Bye-bye.,false
27,Therapist,I hear that your asthma symptoms have been quite challenging lately. Let's explore some ways to improve your health and prevent future hospital visits.,false
27,Client,"Yeah, I definitely don't want to come back here again. But my doctor mentioned Oscar, my dog, might be connected to my symptoms. It's just so sudden after 12 years together.",false
27,Therapist,"That must feel quite unexpected. You're aware of the clinic materials about managing asthma and pets being a common trigger, right?",false
27,Client,"Yes, I have them and I've read them. But I've been focusing on taking my medication. I'm not as knowledgeable about other aspects.",false
27,Therapist,"I see. Given your concern for your baby's health and your progress in quitting smoking, it's crucial to address this pet issue now. It might be hard, but there are always alternatives like adoption by friends or family.",false
27,Client,This feels overwhelming right now. John Carlo isn't affected by Oscar. It's just me. I don't want to rush into decisions without understanding the root cause better.,false
27,Therapist,"Your health is my primary concern, Sal. You've had several severe asthma attacks. Adults with severe asthma can face life-threatening risks. We must take this seriously.",false
27,Client,"So, suddenly Oscar could kill me? He's been with me for 12 years without issue. The doctor mentioned stress and finances too. Why focus solely on Oscar?",false
27,Therapist,"Your asthma is progressively worsening, Sal. Medication alone might not be enough soon. If Oscar is that important, do you prioritize him over your baby and wife? Let's find a solution together.",false
27,Client,"I understand, but you don't grasp my situation fully. I've had Oscar for 12 years. I'm not ready to rehome him without solid evidence he's the main trigger.",false
27,Therapist,"Alright, let's then consider other factors too and find a balanced approach that respects your attachment to Oscar while prioritizing your health.",false
33,Therapist,"Alright, David. Let's start by taking a moment to check in with yourself. How are you feeling today?",false
33,Client,"Pretty good, actually.",false
33,Therapist,I'm glad to hear that. Would you like to take a look at something together? What do you think about this?,false
33,Client,"Oh, that looks great! You really took care of that discoloration issue.",false
33,Therapist,I'm pleased with the result too. It seems there was quite a bit of staining present. Have you given any thought to what might be contributing to that?,false
33,Client,"Hmm, well, the usual suspects - smoking, wine, coffee. All guilty as charged.",false
33,Therapist,I see. Have you considered the possibility of quitting smoking at this point in time?,false
33,Client,"Yeah, I've thought about it. But everyone's always telling me to quit, and I've tried before with no luck. It's getting old hearing the same thing over and over again.",false
33,Therapist,"I understand that you're tired of hearing the same advice. I'm not here to judge or lecture, but rather to explore your thoughts and feelings about smoking together.",false
33,Client,"Yeah, yeah, I know people mean well, but it's just not as simple as they make it out to be.",false
33,Therapist,It sounds like quitting smoking has been a challenging journey for you. Can you tell me more about how smoking fits into your life? How long have you been smoking?,false
33,Client,"I've smoked on and off since I was 14, but it's been consistent for the past 40 years.",false
33,Therapist,"That's quite a history with nicotine. It seems like you've tried various methods to quit in the past, but nothing has stuck yet.",false
33,Client,"Yeah, cold turkey is the only thing that's ever worked for anyone I know, but even then, it's still a struggle.",false
33,Therapist,"I hear that you feel it's your choice whether or not to smoke. If there were a situation where you felt compelled to quit, what might that look like?",false
33,Client,"Hard to say. I've had open-heart surgery and prostate cancer, neither of which made me want to quit.",false
33,Therapist,"I understand that this is a personal decision for you. Right now, it seems that smoking is something you see yourself continuing for the foreseeable future.",false
33,Client,"Yeah, I don't really have any desire to stop at the moment.",false
33,Therapist,"Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me today. I appreciate your openness about not wanting to discuss quitting smoking further right now. Would it be okay if we revisit this topic in our next session, perhaps focusing on some of the challenges and benefits related to smoking?",false
33,Client,"Sure thing, doc. I'm always open to listening.",false
33,Therapist,"Great. And remember, wherever you're at with this, we'll work together to find what feels right for you.",false
33,Client,"Thanks, doc. That means a lot.",false
42,Therapist,"It sounds like you're feeling quite frustrated with your weight loss journey, as if you've hit a wall despite all your efforts?",false
42,Client,"Yes, that's exactly it. I'm putting in so much effort to exercise and eat healthier, but the scale just isn't budging.",false
42,Therapist,"I see. So, it feels like no matter how hard you try, you're not seeing the results you'd hoped for?",false
42,Client,Exactly. And it's not just that. It feels like no one around me cares or understands what I'm going through.,false
42,Therapist,That must be incredibly isolating. You feel unsupported in this important journey of yours?,false
42,Client,"Yes, especially by my father. He doesn't seem to understand why I want to lose weight and even thinks I should gain it back.",false
42,Therapist,"I see. So, you're feeling misunderstood by your father, as if he doesn't appreciate the importance of your health goals?",false
42,Client,"Yes, exactly. It's like he thinks I'm trying to change who I am just to fit some ideal, but that's not what this is about for me. I just want to be healthy and feel good about myself.",false
42,Therapist,"I understand. You're feeling hurt and misunderstood by your father's reaction, as you believe his perspective doesn't align with your genuine desire for a healthier lifestyle?",false
45,Therapist,"Hi, Mary, how was your day?",false
45,Client,It's been alright. Where do you need me to sign today?,false
45,Therapist,You can sign right there. I sense that you're not quite in the mood for our chat today.,false
45,Client,Not particularly.,false
45,Therapist,I noticed you missed your first class today. That doesn't seem to bother you much?,false
45,Client,"It's just another day, you know? Why all these questions?",false
45,Therapist,"You're wondering why we have these visits and what they're about, aren't you?",false
45,Client,"Yeah, it feels like an invasion of my privacy.",false
45,Therapist,I understand that it might seem intrusive. Let me explain again what our program is about.,false
45,Client,"Sure, go ahead.",false
45,Therapist,"My role is to ensure you're here and responsive to your GPS, and that we're aware if you leave without permission. It's also a chance for us to get to know each other better.",false
45,Client,So you're just checking up on me?,false
45,Therapist,"I'm here to support you, Mary. When we first met, you wanted off this program quickly, remember?",false
45,Client,"Yeah, I guess.",false
45,Therapist,"Yet, it seems like you're still feeling annoyed by our visits.",false
45,Client,It's just... I don't know if I can promise to stay put.,false
45,Therapist,You're concerned about whether you'll be able to stick to this successfully?,false
45,Client,"No, it's more like, why does anyone care about my business?",false
45,Therapist,"There are many people involved in your life right now, and that can feel overwhelming. It's okay to feel that way.",false
45,Client,"Yeah, it's just a lot.",false
45,Therapist,"You value your freedom greatly, don't you?",false
45,Client,More than anything.,false
45,Therapist,What steps do you think could help you regain some of that freedom?,false
45,Client,"Signing the papers when you come by, I guess.",false
45,Therapist,That's one step. Is there anything else you'd like to share with me before I go today?,false
45,Client,Not really.,false
45,Therapist,Okay. I'll be back later today.,false
45,Client,"Alright, see you then. Bye.",false
57,Therapist,"Good afternoon, Mr. Johnson?",false
57,Client,Hello.,false
57,Therapist,I'm here to discuss your cholesterol levels and the medication your doctor has prescribed for you.,false
57,Client,I've spoken with my doctor about it already. Isn't that his area of expertise?,false
57,Therapist,"Indeed, but my role is to support you in understanding how to use this medication effectively and help you maximize its benefits.",false
57,Client,"Well, truthfully, I'm not entirely sure if I'll start taking the medicine. I know high cholesterol increases my risk of health issues, but this medication can cause muscle weakness, which I simply cannot afford as a truck driver.",false
57,Therapist,Your doctor has explained that uncontrolled cholesterol puts you at significant risk for stroke or heart attack?,false
57,Client,"Yes, eventually. But right now, it's the potential muscle weakness that concerns me most.",false
57,Therapist,"I understand your concern about the present, but let's consider this: the side effect of muscle weakness is quite rare, and the risk of stroke or heart attack is much higher. If you experience any weakness, your doctor can adjust your medication accordingly.",false
57,Client,Can't I just take the medicine home and think about it some more?,false
57,Therapist,"It's important to start taking it as prescribed, Mr. Johnson. The muscle weakness side effect is rare and not permanent. Your doctor can always make adjustments if needed.",false
57,Client,Alright then.,false
57,Therapist,"Remember, a stroke or heart attack poses a much greater risk than temporary muscle weakness. Please pick up your medication on your way out and take one pill every day to manage your cholesterol levels effectively.",false
57,Client,Understood. I'll do that.,false
57,Therapist,"Thank you for your cooperation, Mr. Johnson.",false
54,Therapist,"Hello Scott, welcome back.",false
54,Client,Hi there.,false
54,Therapist,We had briefly discussed earlier your desire to resume exercising. Can you tell me more about that?,false
54,Client,"Yeah, I've been meaning to get back into it. I used to work out regularly, but life got busy and now I'm just out of the habit. I feel like I need to restart.",false
54,Therapist,It sounds like you're feeling motivated to make a change. Let's explore this together. Can you help me understand why getting back to the gym is important for you?,false
54,Client,"Well, I've gained some weight around my middle and I'd like to get back into my old jeans. But more than that, I just feel better when I'm active.",false
54,Therapist,It seems your goal is multifaceted - improving your physical appearance and also enhancing your overall well-being. Let's break this down further. Can you list some reasons why returning to the gym is important for you?,false
54,Client,Sure thing.,false
54,Therapist,"Great. And let's also brainstorm some strategies that could help you get there consistently. Your gym is only a couple of miles away, right? Have you considered walking or biking there?",false
54,Client,That's an idea. But I'd still like to do weightlifting and other exercises at the gym.,false
54,Therapist,"Absolutely, variety in your workout routine is important. So, what specific aspects of your appearance would you like to improve through exercise?",false
54,Client,I'd just like to fit into my clothes comfortably again and feel healthier overall.,false
54,Therapist,"That's a great goal. Now, let's discuss how you can make time for this. What might be some obstacles and potential solutions?",false
54,Client,"Well, I could wake up an hour earlier to go before work.",false
54,Therapist,"That's a practical suggestion. It shows you're committed to making this change. Let's try that out and see how it goes. Between now and our next session, experiment with waking up early and make note of any challenges or successes you encounter. We'll discuss further then.",false
54,Client,"Okay, I will.",false
54,Therapist,"Looking forward to hearing about your progress. Until next time, Scott.",false
54,Client,"Thanks, bye.",false
51,Therapist,Could you tell me what you understand about the flu shot?,false
51,Client,"Well, I know the flu can be serious, but since I'm generally healthy, I don't think I really need it. Isn't it more for older people?",false
51,Therapist,It sounds like you believe the vaccine is mainly for those who are vulnerable to illness.,false
51,Client,Yeah.,false
51,Therapist,Would you be open to learning more about the flu vaccine and its importance?,false
51,Client,"Sure, go ahead.",false
51,Therapist,"You're correct that being young and healthy means you'd likely fare well with the flu. However, we know that it can be severe for the elderly, pregnant individuals, and babies. By getting vaccinated, you help protect not just yourself but also those around you who might be more susceptible.",false
51,Client,I see.,false
51,Therapist,"Now that you have this information, how do you feel about receiving the flu vaccine?",false
51,Client,"My grandparents wouldn't handle the flu well, and my co-worker is pregnant too. It's for their sake that I should get it.",false
51,Therapist,"So, considering those in your life who are vulnerable, getting the flu shot could help protect them.",false
51,Client,"Yes, you're right.",false
69,Therapist,"Good afternoon, Dr. Martin. I understand you have a question for me today. Could you tell me what's on your mind?",false
69,Client,"I apologize if this is confusing, but are you the pharmacist? I had a specific question about my medication, citalopram.",false
69,Therapist,"Yes, indeed I am the pharmacist here today. You're taking citalopram, an antidepressant available in 10mg, 20mg, and 40mg strengths. It's primarily excreted through urine with a half-life of approximately 35 hours. Like many medications, it can have side effects affecting various systems, including sexual function, cardiovascular health, and gastrointestinal tract.",false
69,Client,"Thank you for that information. My main concern was whether citalopram interacts with another medication I'm taking, phenelzine?",false
69,Therapist,"Ah, I see. Let me just confirm that for you. Yes, it appears there should be no significant interaction between those two medications at this time.",false
69,Client,"That's reassuring to hear. Unfortunately, I have another appointment I must attend now.",false
69,Therapist,"Of course, Dr. Martin. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any other questions or concerns in the future. Take care.",false
63,Therapist,"So Tom, this infection has been quite painful for you. We have antibiotics that can help if taken faithfully for 10 days. Are you willing to commit to that?",false
63,Client,Absolutely.,false
63,Therapist,I'd like to discuss a screening form you filled out earlier regarding drug use. Is that alright with you?,false
63,Client,Sure thing.,false
63,Therapist,"Let's review it together. It mentions occasional use of drugs other than medical purposes. Which substances have you been using, Tom?",false
63,Client,"Methamphetamine, mostly.",false
63,Therapist,I see. And how do you typically consume it?,false
63,Client,"Snorted, always snort it.",false
63,Therapist,Not injected? And are there any other drugs you use regularly?,false
63,Client,"Just alcohol, sometimes.",false
63,Therapist,How often would you say you're using methamphetamine?,false
63,Client,"Two to three times a month, tops.",false
63,Therapist,"So occasional use then. As you may know, methamphetamine use carries certain health risks. Given your usage pattern, we consider you a risky user. One potential consequence is sexually transmitted diseases. Do you think your recent STD could be linked to your methamphetamine use?",false
63,Client,"Yeah, it's possible. I mean, I don't usually have unprotected sex, but when I'm high on meth...",false
63,Therapist,So methamphetamine might cloud your judgment during sexual encounters?,false
63,Client,"Yeah, that's true.",false
63,Therapist,"Apart from this STD scare, how else is methamphetamine affecting your life?",false
63,Client,"Not really. I mean, I only use it socially with friends at clubs, a couple times a month max.",false
63,Therapist,"Tom, given the risks involved, I strongly recommend stopping methamphetamine use altogether.",false
63,Client,"I understand, but that's easier said than done. It's such a big part of my social life and sex life...",false
63,Therapist,"I hear you. On a scale of 0 to 10, how ready are you to quit methamphetamine completely?",false
63,Client,"Uh, maybe a 3? This STD scare has really shaken me up, but it's still tough to think about quitting cold turkey.",false
63,Therapist,What other concerns do you have regarding your methamphetamine use?,false
63,Client,I worry about what it might be cut with. You never know if it's safe or not.,false
63,Therapist,"It sounds like you have several reasons for wanting to stop using methamphetamine, despite the challenges involved.",false
63,Client,"Yeah, I just don't want to end up with something worse than gonorrhea.",false
63,Therapist,What do you think could help make quitting easier?,false
63,Client,"Having other things to do on weekends, finding a new social circle maybe...",false
63,Therapist,Is there anyone in your life who doesn't use methamphetamine? Someone who might support you through this?,false
63,Client,"My sister. We're close, and I think she knows about my usage.",false
63,Therapist,Have you talked to her about it?,false
63,Client,"Not really, but I could. She'd probably be supportive.",false
63,Therapist,"So, you see both the benefits and challenges of quitting methamphetamine. It's ultimately your decision, but talking to your sister for support might help.",false
63,Client,"Yeah, that makes sense.",false
63,Therapist,Let's schedule another appointment in a month then. Would that work for you?,false
63,Client,"Yes, that'd be fine.",false
72,Therapist,"Alright, Chris. I wanted to touch base because we have a strict no-drugs and alcohol policy here at the school. As athletic director, it's my duty to ensure all our student-athletes adhere to this rule. I've heard some whispers about a recent party where you were present, but I don't have concrete evidence yet.",false
72,Client,"Right. Actually, there's something I'd like to discuss about that weekend. Typically, I'm an honor student who spends weekends studying, and my parents don't allow me to attend parties. However, this time, I felt pressured by friends to go, and once there, I felt compelled to fit in with the drinking games and such.",false
72,Therapist,"I see. It's easy to feel that pressure in situations like that. I've been where you are too, Chris. We all want to fit in sometimes.",false
72,Client,"Exactly. But now, I realize it's not worth compromising my health or my place on the team for temporary social acceptance.",false
72,Therapist,"That's a mature perspective, Chris. You understand the consequences better than most. Let's find a way to navigate these situations without compromising your values and our school rules.",false
72,Client,I appreciate that. I think I'll avoid those kinds of parties in the future and be more selective about who I spend time with. I don't want my actions to end up online for everyone to see.,false
72,Therapist,"That's a smart approach. We need to trust each other here, Chris. If you promise me you'll stick to our rules, we can continue supporting your athletic journey.",false
72,Client,I understand and I promise. No more parties or public displays of anything against the rules.,false
72,Therapist,Great. Let's shake on it.,false
72,Client,Shake. See you later.,false
72,Therapist,"Alright, Chris. Take care.",false
66,Therapist,"Good afternoon, Mr. Stowe. I'm Bruce Berger, your case manager with the health plan.",false
66,Client,Nice to meet you.,false
66,Therapist,How are you feeling today? I understand you're here to discuss managing your diabetes diagnosis.,false
66,Client,"It's been a lot to take in. Just found out I have diabetes, and the doctor said my blood sugar was really high. She mentioned all these complications like eye problems and circulation issues. It's scary, and then she told me I need to do all this stuff to manage it. I'm feeling pretty overwhelmed right now.",false
66,Therapist,"It sounds like you're feeling blindsided by this news, Mr. Stowe. You're scared about the potential consequences of diabetes, and you're also feeling daunted by the changes you'll need to make.",false
66,Client,"Yeah, that's it exactly. I don't want those things to happen to me, but when she listed everything I have to do, I thought, ""I'm not sure I can handle all that.""",false
66,Therapist,"Let's break this down into manageable steps, Mr. Stowe. Your doctor is right; we need to get your blood sugar under control to prevent those complications. But we don't have to tackle everything at once. Let's start with what you feel most confident about.",false
66,Client,"I think taking my medicine as prescribed will be okay. I understand how important it is, given my high blood sugar levels.",false
66,Therapist,That's great to hear. Taking your medication once a day seems doable for now. We can build on that success and gradually incorporate other changes like healthier eating habits and increased physical activity.,false
66,Client,"The doctor also mentioned monitoring my blood sugar. It seemed complicated at first, but I get it now – it's to track how well the other changes are working.",false
66,Therapist,Exactly. Monitoring gives you feedback so you can see the impact of your efforts on your blood sugar levels. How does this approach make you feel now?,false
66,Client,"It feels more manageable knowing we're taking things step by step. I'm committed to starting with my medication, and I think I can do that without any issues.",false
66,Therapist,"That's wonderful to hear, Mr. Stowe. Let's continue working together like this, focusing on one thing at a time.",false
78,Therapist,"Hello, are you Julie Thompson?",false
78,Client,"Yes, that's me.",false
78,Therapist,"Hi Julie, I'm Bruce Berger. I work at the clinic and noticed Sarah's rescue inhaler prescription is ready for pickup. It seems she's been to the ER five times this year due to her asthma. How has that been for you?",false
78,Client,It's been really tough. Seeing her struggle to breathe like that... I'm always worried when we have to go to the ER.,false
78,Therapist,It sounds like you're very committed to helping Sarah manage her asthma better.,false
78,Client,"Absolutely, I'll do anything to prevent those scary episodes.",false
78,Therapist,I also noticed it's been a few months since you last picked up her chronic inhaler prescription. Have you been having trouble with that?,false
78,Client,"Yes, I found out there are steroids in it, and I don't want Sarah taking them. I've read about the potential side effects... I just don't want her exposed to them.",false
78,Therapist,I understand your concern. You're a caring parent who wants the best for Sarah.,false
78,Client,"And another thing, I smoke, but I make sure not to around her so it doesn't affect her asthma.",false
78,Therapist,Thank you for being open about that. It shows you're really thinking about Sarah's health.,false
78,Therapist,"Let's discuss the chronic inhaler and the steroids you're worried about. This medicine isn't like the ones you've heard about, like anabolic steroids. Can we talk about it?",false
78,Client,"Sure, I'd like to understand better.",false
78,Therapist,The medicine in her inhaler is a small amount from the same family as those big steroids but doesn't have the same effects. It actually reduces inflammation in Sarah's lungs and isn't absorbed into her body.,false
78,Client,"Oh, I see. So it won't cause those health problems?",false
78,Therapist,"Exactly. Now, let's talk about how asthma affects Sarah's lungs...",false
81,Therapist,How did your parents approach raising you?,false
81,Client,"Well, I suppose they had their ways. It was alright, I guess.",false
81,Therapist,Can you share more about what that was like for you?,false
81,Client,I've noticed some changes in my body lately.,false
81,Therapist,That must be quite an experience. How has it been making you feel?,false
81,Client,Truthfully? It's frightening.,false
81,Therapist,"So, this physical transformation is causing you discomfort?",false
81,Client,"Yes, and there's this unknown aspect too. I sense something's changing inside me, but I don't understand what's happening.",false
81,Therapist,Let's explore that together. Why haven't you reached out to your doctor yet?,false
81,Client,It feels daunting. There's so much involved in setting up an appointment.,false
81,Therapist,Can you tell me more about what makes it feel overwhelming for you?,false
81,Client,"I dread making phone calls, and there's always paperwork involved. Plus, I'm not sure how to get there, and needles... well, let's just say they're not my favorite.",false
81,Therapist,"It sounds like the practical aspects of scheduling an appointment are challenging, and there's also some anxiety tied to medical settings. How can we work together to address these concerns?",false
81,Client,Would you help me make that call?,false
81,Therapist,"Absolutely, let's do it together. Now, about attending the appointment itself...",false
81,Client,Could you come with me? Your presence would really help calm my nerves.,false
81,Therapist,"I'll certainly try my best to arrange it, but let's also brainstorm some other support options in case my schedule doesn't align.",false
87,Therapist,"Let's begin by discussing your recent questionnaire responses. We'll have about 20 minutes for our conversation today, and I'd like to start wherever you feel most comfortable.",false
87,Client,"Well, when I was filling out those questionnaires last week, it was kind of eye-opening. I hadn't really considered how much I drink until then.",false
87,Therapist,It sounds like the results were quite surprising to you.,false
87,Client,"Yeah, I mean, I never realized how much I was drinking until I tried to count my drinks each day. It's more than I thought.",false
87,Therapist,"You found yourself saying, ""Whoa, this is a lot,"" when you saw your patterns laid out like that?",false
87,Client,"Exactly. And then, talking to my roommate about it, she was shocked too. She had no idea I was drinking that much.",false
87,Therapist,"It seems the reality of your drinking habits has been quite different from what you'd assumed, and even your friends were surprised when they heard the details.",false
87,Client,"Yeah, I guess I thought everyone drank as much as me, but that's not the case at all. [laughs softly]",false
87,Therapist,This new awareness must be quite sobering for you.,false
87,Client,"Yeah, it was really weird to see it all written down like that.",false
93,Therapist,"It seems there are several areas you'd like to focus on. You've mentioned increasing physical activity, improving eating habits, and boosting body confidence. Which of these feels most pressing for you today?",false
93,Client,"I think starting with physical activity is a good idea. It might be easier than changing my diet right away, but if I can establish a routine, it could help with other changes later on.",false
93,Therapist,"That makes sense. So, let's explore physical activity further. What really motivates you to start being more active? You've mentioned energy levels and mood improvements. Are there any other benefits that drive you?",false
93,Client,"Yeah, feeling stronger physically is a big one. Even small tasks like opening jars can be challenging. Plus, I think it would boost my body confidence too.",false
93,Therapist,"So, strength for daily tasks and improved body confidence are important to you. On a scale of zero to 10, how ready are you to make changes in your physical activity?",false
93,Client,I'd say an eight. There are so many benefits that really motivate me.,false
93,Therapist,"That's great to hear. You've identified energy, mood, strength, and body confidence as significant benefits. Have I missed anything?",false
93,Client,"No, those are the big ones for me.",false
93,Therapist,"Fantastic. Now, would you like to discuss what physical activities might work best for you?",false
96,Therapist,"Welcome, Katie. I'm glad you're here today. Let's start by you sharing a bit about yourself and what brings you to see me?",false
96,Client,Hi. My doctor sent me here. He has concerns about my pregnancy and my baby. I'm just doing what he told me to.,false
96,Therapist,I appreciate your cooperation. Could you tell me more about his concerns?,false
96,Client,"Yeah, he's worried about my alcohol intake.",false
96,Therapist,I see. And how do you feel about that? Do you share those concerns?,false
96,Client,Not really. It's not a big deal for me.,false
96,Therapist,Okay. So it's not something you're too worried about at the moment. Let's talk more about your alcohol use and daily life. Can you tell me about that?,false
96,Client,"Sure. I have a glass of wine with dinner every night, and sometimes when I'm out with friends. It's been a family tradition.",false
96,Therapist,I understand it's a part of your culture. How do you feel about the idea of reducing or stopping alcohol during pregnancy?,false
96,Client,"Well, I've heard mixed messages. Some people say it's fine, others say it's not. I'm independent, so I'll decide for myself.",false
96,Therapist,It sounds like you value autonomy and making your own decisions. Let's explore this together. Have you looked into Canada's guidelines on alcohol consumption?,false
96,Client,"Yeah, but I don't see the harm in having a drink or two.",false
96,Therapist,"I'd like to share some information with you. According to Canadian guidelines, no amount of alcohol is considered safe during pregnancy. What are your thoughts on that?",false
96,Client,I haven't seen any proof that it's harmful. I know people who drank during pregnancy and had healthy babies.,false
96,Therapist,I understand your perspective. Let's focus on what's important to you. You mentioned wanting a healthy baby. How does protecting your baby fit into this?,false
96,Client,It's really important to me. I want to be a good parent and take care of my baby.,false
96,Therapist,That's wonderful to hear. We can work together to find ways to protect your baby while also considering what feels right for you. Would you like some help discussing this with your partner?,false
96,Client,"Yes, that would be great. Thank you.",false
96,Therapist,"You're welcome, Katie. Let's continue our conversation next time and see how things go with your partner. Until then, take care.",false
96,Client,"Thanks, I will. Bye.",false
90,Therapist,"Tommy, I noticed some photos on Facebook that gave me pause. You're such a responsible young man, and seeing you at a party with alcohol was concerning. I worry about the potential consequences for your future.",false
90,Client,"It wasn't like I was seeking it out, therapist. It was just a social gathering. My friends were drinking, so I joined in, but it's not something I do regularly. I can control my intake.",false
90,Therapist,"Tommy, underage drinking has serious risks - arrest, accidents, harm to your education. You have such potential. Can you see why I'm concerned?",false
90,Client,"I understand where you're coming from, therapist. I thought I had it under control. I didn't want to overdo it or let my friends down.",false
90,Therapist,"Tommy, any amount of alcohol underage is too much. Let's consider the risks together.",false
90,Client,"I don't think I drink that much, therapist. It's mainly social events, not something I do alone.",false
90,Therapist,"Even if it's just every other weekend, Tommy, it's still a concern. Can you think of other ways to have fun and stay safe?",false
90,Client,"I guess I could focus more on schoolwork and productive activities, therapist. I see your point about making better choices for my future.",false
90,Therapist,"That's great, Tommy. Maybe consider hanging out with friends who make healthier choices too?",false
90,Client,"You're right, therapist. I've been following my current friends' lead without really thinking about it. I could try to spend more time with peers from the youth group instead.",false
90,Therapist,"That's a step in the right direction, Tommy. Let's work together on a plan to help you quit drinking and take control of your life.",false
90,Client,"Okay, therapist. I think that would be beneficial for me. I want to experience life clearly, not through a haze of alcohol.",false
105,Therapist,"So, tell me about your recent experiences with exercise?",false
105,Client,"Since our last conversation, I've been to the gym a couple of times.",false
105,Therapist,That's great to hear. How has that made you feel?,false
105,Client,"My pants fit better now, and I'm really pleased about it.",false
105,Therapist,That's wonderful. Have you noticed any other changes besides your clothing fitting better?,false
105,Client,"Yes, my back doesn't hurt as much anymore.",false
105,Therapist,"That's fantastic. Now, what challenges have you faced while trying to go to the gym more often?",false
105,Client,It's still hard for me to find the time and energy. I need to be patient with myself and build up gradually.,false
105,Therapist,What could help you spend more time at the gym consistently?,false
105,Client,"Just sticking with it, even if it means going less frequently initially. Last week was tough because I only went on Thursday and Saturday.",false
105,Therapist,"But you did go twice, which is an improvement from not going at all. How does that make you feel?",false
105,Client,"It's encouraging, but it's also discouraging seeing younger guys who can lift more weight or run longer on the treadmill than me.",false
105,Therapist,"I see. So, there's a part of you that wants to 'keep up' with them, but another part knows that's not realistic or desirable at this stage?",false
105,Client,"Exactly. When I'm not at the gym, I realize I don't want to be 'buff' anymore, but when I'm there, seeing those guys makes me feel like I should strive for that again.",false
105,Therapist,It sounds like the main benefit you're experiencing now is your clothes fitting better and feeling good about yourself. What other positive changes have you noticed?,false
105,Client,"I've been making some progress with my diet too. I've cut down on junk food, but I'd like to do more once I start seeing more results from the gym.",false
105,Therapist,That's a great connection you're making there. How can we help strengthen that connection even further?,false
105,Client,"Well, if I see myself losing weight or improving at the gym, it'll be easier for me to resist temptations like ice cream sundaes because I'll know how much effort it takes to burn off those calories.",false
105,Therapist,That's a powerful realization. How does that make you feel about your progress so far?,false
105,Client,Pretty pleased. I'm glad we talked last time because it motivated me to go to the gym for the first time in a long while.,false
99,Therapist,"Steve, before we wrap up today, I'd like to discuss your drinking habits. Would you be open to that?",false
99,Client,Sure thing.,false
99,Therapist,"Great. You completed our survey today, and I noticed some patterns I'd like to review with you. It seems you're drinking two to three times a week, having three to four drinks each time, and sometimes more than six in a week.",false
99,Client,"Yeah, that sounds about right.",false
99,Therapist,"I want to express my concern about this level of consumption, Steve. Excessive drinking can exacerbate existing problems or cause new ones. Have you considered how your drinking might relate to your anxiety and insomnia?",false
99,Client,Not really. I don't think I drink enough for it to be a problem.,false
99,Therapist,"I understand that perspective, but let's explore this together. Many people believe alcohol helps them sleep better, yet it often has the opposite effect due to something called the rebound effect.",false
99,Client,"Yeah, I guess I do wake up around 2 AM on nights I've had too much to drink.",false
99,Therapist,"That's a common experience, Steve. Let me show you this chart. For men under 65, low-risk drinking is no more than 14 drinks a week and four per day. Based on your responses, you're falling into the high-risk category.",false
99,Client,"Wow, I didn't realize it was that bad.",false
99,Therapist,"It's helpful to gain perspective like this. On a scale of 1-10, how ready are you to make changes in your drinking habits?",false
99,Client,"I don't know. This is all new to me. I'd put myself at a five, I guess.",false
99,Therapist,"That's progress, Steve. What makes you choose five instead of a lower number?",false
99,Client,"Well, I'm training for a marathon and want to optimize my health. Plus, I don't think I'm an alcoholic or anything.",false
99,Therapist,"I appreciate your honesty. So, considering all this, what steps are you willing to take now to cut back on drinking?",false
99,Client,"I guess I could aim to drink no more than three times a week, with no more than five or six drinks each time.",false
99,Therapist,"That's a start. Sometimes writing down goals can help solidify them. If you were to set a goal for your drinking, what would it be?",false
99,Client,"No more than 18 drinks a week, I guess.",false
99,Therapist,"That's an improvement, Steve. Keep in mind that even at 18 drinks a week, you're still above the low-risk level. Let's aim to reduce this further over time. We can discuss your progress next month.",false
99,Client,Sounds good. Thanks for bringing all this to my attention.,false
99,Therapist,"You're welcome, Steve. I'm here to support you. Until next time.",false
102,Therapist,"Hi, Liz. Thanks for taking the time to meet with me today.",false
102,Client,Sure thing.,false
102,Therapist,"So, what's been on your mind lately that you'd like to focus on changing or working towards?",false
102,Client,"Well... I've been thinking about getting back into working out. I really want to start again. I know it's important and all, but finding the motivation has been tough.",false
102,Therapist,It sounds like this is something you've been giving a lot of thought to. I appreciate your honesty about needing that extra push.,false
102,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
102,Therapist,You mentioned having a busy schedule. Let's explore how we can fit exercise into your routine without it feeling overwhelming.,false
102,Client,"That would be helpful, yes. It's not so much laziness as just finding the time and motivation to stick with it.",false
102,Therapist,I understand. It's easy to feel like we're making excuses when we're struggling to find balance. Let's focus on practical solutions together.,false
102,Client,"Okay, that sounds fair.",false
102,Therapist,"You mentioned your gym membership. How about we aim for three sessions a week, maybe 30 minutes each time? That way, you're not committing to an hour-long block every day.",false
102,Client,That sounds more manageable. I think I can fit that into my schedule.,false
102,Therapist,Great! Let's also discuss what might help boost your motivation and make those workouts enjoyable for you.,false
102,Client,"Okay, let's do that.",false
102,Therapist,"Looking forward to our next session. Until then, why don't you try scheduling one of these shorter workouts this week?",false
102,Client,"Alright, I will. Thanks.",false
108,Therapist,"Welcome, Sarah. I'm glad you could join me today. I understand you've been juggling quite a bit lately. Could you share some of what's been on your plate?",false
108,Client,"Well, I have a two-year-old son, work full-time as a server, and recently started night classes again. It's all just feeling overwhelming.",false
108,Therapist,I see. You're managing a lot as a single mom. How has that been going for you?,false
108,Client,"It's tough. My mom usually watches my son, but lately, she's been unreliable. I've had to miss work and class because of it.",false
108,Therapist,That must be stressful. Have you considered other options for childcare besides your mom?,false
108,Client,"There's this one neighbor who stepped in once when my mom couldn't watch him. She has a daughter around the same age, so they played together fine.",false
108,Therapist,That sounds promising. Have you thought about reaching out to her again?,false
108,Client,"I could, but I don't know if she'd be interested in doing it regularly.",false
108,Therapist,"Let's explore that possibility together. What if you offered to cook dinner for them in exchange for watching your son? You're studying culinary arts, right?",false
108,Client,That's an interesting idea. I never thought of something like that.,false
108,Therapist,"It could be a win-win situation. Now, how many days are you in school each week?",false
108,Client,"Three nights - Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.",false
108,Therapist,Okay. Let's think about how we can make these nights work better for you and your son.,false
108,Client,"If my neighbor could watch him one of those nights, it would really help my mom too.",false
108,Therapist,"That sounds like a good start. Now, have you heard of Head Start? It's an affordable preschool program that might be beneficial for your son when he turns three in a couple of months.",false
108,Client,I've heard of it but don't know much about it.,false
108,Therapist,It's a high-quality program designed for families like yours. I can provide more information if you'd like.,false
108,Client,"Yes, please. It sounds like it could be really good for him and help me with childcare too.",false
108,Therapist,"That's great to hear. Now, I noticed in your notes that you're working on reducing smoking and drinking. How's that going?",false
108,Client,"It's been harder than I thought, but I've had some successful days. I always make sure to smoke outside away from my son though.",false
108,Therapist,That's commendable. You're clearly committed to his well-being. Let's revisit your progress in two weeks and see how things are going with childcare and your personal goals.,false
108,Client,"Okay, that sounds good.",false
108,Therapist,"Thank you for coming in today, Sarah. It was great meeting you.",false
108,Client,"Thanks, bye.",false
120,Therapist,"I'm glad we've made some progress today, and I believe you'll feel better soon. While we still have time left, there's another topic I'd like to discuss with you. I've noticed your blood pressure and weight have been increasing slightly over the past few years. We haven't had much chance to talk about this before, but I might be able to offer some helpful strategies. Would it be alright if we discussed weight management for a few minutes?",false
120,Client,"Sure thing, doc. I know my weight's an issue, but every time I try to lose it, I end up gaining it back again. I don't know what to do.",false
120,Therapist,It can indeed be frustrating trying to manage weight. Let's explore this together and find strategies that work for you.,false
120,Client,"But doc, with work being so busy and the kids taking up so much time, I don't see how I can lose weight now.",false
120,Therapist,"I understand your concerns. There are many factors involved in weight management, but we don't need to figure it all out today. Let's focus on one small step that fits into your life right now.",false
120,Client,"Okay, doc. What should I do?",false
120,Therapist,"Well, physical activity plays a significant role in managing weight and overall health. It benefits our joints, reduces stress, and aids in weight management. Let's discuss some ways to incorporate activity into your daily life.",false
120,Client,"But doc, I don't have time for an hour at the gym every day.",false
120,Therapist,"I understand that, but even a few minutes of any physical activity can be very beneficial. For instance, what activities do you enjoy doing?",false
120,Client,I like walking.,false
120,Therapist,"That's great! Walking is an excellent form of exercise. Even just a few minutes can make a difference, and it has the added benefit of being accessible anywhere.",false
120,Client,"But doc, isn't walking too mild to help with weight loss?",false
120,Therapist,"Not at all. Every little bit helps, and when you have more time, you can always do more. Plus, walking is convenient as it doesn't require a gym membership.",false
120,Client,"That sounds good, doc. You know what? There's a nice park near here. I might take a short walk after this appointment.",false
120,Therapist,That's wonderful to hear. Would you like some help finding dance classes nearby?,false
120,Client,"Oh, that would be great! My family's always been supportive of my dancing too.",false
120,Therapist,It's fantastic that your family is so supportive. Let's plan to follow up in a few weeks and discuss how things are going. We can also explore other strategies then.,false
120,Client,"Okay, doc. I'll make an appointment and start dancing right away.",false
120,Therapist,That's great! Looking forward to seeing you soon.,false
117,Therapist,Welcome back. What brings you here today?,false
117,Client,"I'm tired of my drinking habits. I've been drinking too much lately, and I thought it'd be helpful to talk about it with someone.",false
117,Therapist,You feel that your drinking has become a problem recently?,false
117,Client,"Yeah, it's gotten worse over the last six months since my breakup. I started going out more often to meet people, and now I'm drinking almost every night.",false
117,Therapist,That sounds like quite a change from before. What makes you think your drinking has increased?,false
117,Client,"Well, I used to drink socially, but now it's become a way for me to calm my nerves when talking to guys. But it's not working; I'm just ending up with bad hangovers.",false
117,Therapist,"It seems like alcohol helps you feel more confident initially, but then it has these negative consequences.",false
117,Client,"Exactly. And I've gained weight because I'm not eating properly anymore, and I haven't been exercising either.",false
117,Therapist,"So, you'd like to cut back on your drinking, particularly during the weekdays?",false
117,Client,"Yes, that's what I want to do. I don't want to stop entirely, but I need to find a better balance.",false
117,Therapist,"It sounds like there are some benefits to your social life from drinking, but it's also causing some issues you'd like to address.",false
117,Client,"Yeah, and I've never had to deal with this before. This is new territory for me.",false
117,Therapist,"On a scale of 0 to 100, how important is it for you to cut back on your drinking?",false
117,Client,"I'd say an 80. That's why I'm here, after all.",false
117,Therapist,You feel quite strongly about making this change. What makes you think it's so important?,false
117,Client,It just feels like things are spiraling out of control. I don't want to keep going down this path.,false
117,Therapist,"So, what do you think your first step should be in cutting back on your drinking?",false
117,Client,I think I need to stop drinking during the weekdays and plan my weekends better so it doesn't get out of hand again.,false
117,Therapist,That sounds like a great starting point. How does that goal feel for you right now?,false
117,Client,It feels good. I'm ready to make this change.,false
114,Therapist,"In summary, according to the Minnesota State Mankato security report, you were stopped on Stadium Road last Friday for driving under the influence. You're now 20 years old and were transported to detox afterwards. Dylan, could you confirm if this information is accurate? Additionally, I'd appreciate it if you could share some details leading up to this incident.",false
114,Client,"Yeah, that's right. It happened about a week ago. I was at my friend's place watching the Vikings game, having a few beers. Things got out of hand, and by the time the game was over, I couldn't find a ride home. So, I drove myself.",false
114,Therapist,"You found yourself drinking more than intended due to disappointment about the game's outcome. When your roommate couldn't give you a ride, you decided to drive home despite knowing it wasn't safe. Is that how it unfolded?",false
114,Client,"Yeah, that's exactly what happened. I mean, I'm just a normal college kid who likes to have fun with friends. It wasn't like a big party or anything.",false
114,Therapist,You were trying to be responsible by finding a ride home but ended up making an impulsive decision due to your disappointment and lack of available transportation. Is that fair?,false
114,Client,"Yeah, I guess so. I didn't think about the consequences at that moment.",false
114,Therapist,"Dylan, you've shared what brought you here today. What do you believe is the core issue you're facing?",false
114,Client,"Well, I think I have a drinking problem. But honestly, it's more like I keep getting caught while my friends don't.",false
114,Therapist,"It seems like you attribute your situation to bad luck rather than considering changes in your behavior. If that remains your perspective, what might happen if things stay the same?",false
114,Client,"More trouble with the police and school, probably. I can't afford that right now – not financially or time-wise.",false
114,Therapist,"How important is it for you to avoid future problems with the police or school, Dylan?",false
114,Client,"It's really important. Detox was awful, and I don't want to go through that again. Plus, if I get suspended, my dad will make me work on his farm in Iowa, which would ruin my social life.",false
114,Therapist,What steps could you take to prevent another detox visit and suspension?,false
114,Client,I guess I should drink less and avoid situations where I'm more likely to get into trouble. Maybe only drink at home or wait until I'm 21 before drinking outside the house. There must be other things to do around here that don't involve alcohol.,false
114,Therapist,"On a scale of 1 to 10, how confident are you in your ability to follow through with these changes?",false
114,Client,"I'd say about a six. I think I can do it, but I'm not entirely sure yet.",false
114,Therapist,What could help boost that confidence and move you closer to an eight or nine on the scale?,false
114,Client,Maybe finding alternative activities that don't revolve around drinking. There's got to be more to do in this town than just drink.,false
114,Therapist,In what ways might your life improve if you succeed in making these changes?,false
114,Client,"I'd probably feel better overall, and I wouldn't be hungover all the time. I could make it to my 8:00 AMs and actually pay attention in class. My grades were good in high school, so I know I can do well here too.",false
114,Therapist,College is about making choices. How do your beliefs and values influence your decision-making regarding drinking?,false
114,Client,"Education is really important to me, and I want to be an international journalist someday. If I prioritize my studies and cut back on drinking, I won't disappoint my parents or jeopardize my future.",false
114,Therapist,"Thank you for coming in today. As part of your sanction, you'll be placed on university disciplinary probation and required to attend an alcohol education seminar at a cost of $150.",false
114,Client,"Okay, when is the seminar?",false
111,Therapist,"Hi there, are you Katie?",false
111,Client,Yeah.,false
111,Therapist,"Hello, I'm Beth. I work with Nurse Practitioner Mrs. Smith who you just saw. Do you have a moment to chat about something important?",false
111,Client,Sure thing. What's this about?,false
111,Therapist,"Great. While waiting for your appointment today, you filled out a questionnaire about your health habits. You mentioned using marijuana regularly. I'd like to explore that with you, if that's okay.",false
111,Client,"Oh, sure. I mean, it's not a big deal now that it's decriminalized in Virginia, right? I'm not here for trouble or anything.",false
111,Therapist,"Absolutely not, Katie. I just want to understand how marijuana fits into your life. Can you tell me more about how and why you use it?",false
111,Client,"Well, it's just a couple times a week to help me relax. I've got a lot going on with my academic scholarship and being on the debate team.",false
111,Therapist,"It sounds like you're managing a lot of stress with your responsibilities. Marijuana helps you unwind, is that right?",false
111,Client,"Yeah. I guess I'm just anxious by nature, so it helps calm my nerves.",false
111,Therapist,"I see. You've been very successful academically, but the transition to college has brought on some extra anxiety. Is that fair to say?",false
111,Client,"Yeah, I suppose. It's just... I'm the first in my family to go to college, and I feel like I'm in over my head sometimes.",false
111,Therapist,"That makes sense. Now, besides helping you relax, what other benefits do you find from using marijuana?",false
111,Client,"Well, I guess it helps me fit in with some of the more sophisticated kids here. But honestly, I don't know if it's really working.",false
111,Therapist,"So when you use pot with your peers, you feel like you're fitting in better, but it doesn't necessarily make you feel more comfortable or accepted?",false
111,Client,"Yeah, that's about right.",false
111,Therapist,Can you think of any downsides to using marijuana?,false
111,Client,"I guess I'm worried about getting caught and what my parents would say if they found out. And money's tight, so I usually bum it off my roommate, which is kind of embarrassing.",false
111,Therapist,"So using pot isn't helping you feel more comfortable socially, and it's causing you stress about potential consequences and financial strain. Is that correct?",false
111,Client,"Yeah, when you put it like that, it doesn't sound great.",false
111,Therapist,"Katie, I'd like to suggest something. You mentioned dealing with anxiety, have you ever considered speaking to a counselor about that?",false
111,Client,No way. We don't do that kind of thing in my family. It's for crazy people and we can't afford it anyway.,false
111,Therapist,"I understand your concerns, but many students here find talking to our counselors really helpful. They learn new skills to manage anxiety, and it's free and confidential. Would you be open to considering it?",false
111,Client,"I don't know. My parents wouldn't approve, and I can't afford it.",false
111,Therapist,"The counseling services are free, Katie. And we're legally bound to protect your privacy. We won't tell your parents unless there's a safety concern. Would that make you feel more comfortable about exploring this option?",false
111,Client,"Okay, I guess I'll think about it.",false
111,Therapist,"If you'd like, I can walk you over to our counseling center now and introduce you to one of the counselors. No pressure, though. It's just good for you to know where it is.",false
111,Client,"Alright, sure. Let's go.",false
123,Therapist,"Great news first, you don't have any cavities. However, I've noticed something concerning in your mouth that we should discuss.",false
123,Client,"Okay, what is it?",false
123,Therapist,"There's significant irritation on the roof of your mouth, consistent with tobacco use. You mentioned not using tobacco, so I'm curious about this discrepancy.",false
123,Client,I don't smoke cigarettes.,false
123,Therapist,"Understood. The irritation is quite pronounced, turning white and showing red spots. This condition, nicotinic stomatitis, is typically seen only in tobacco users. Are you smoking pipes or cigars, or could something else be causing this?",false
123,Client,"Well, when I go out with friends to lounges, we sometimes receive mini cigars like Swisher Sweets as gifts.",false
123,Therapist,"Ah, those are still cigars and contain tobacco. Did you know they can cause lung cancer, oral cancer, and emphysema just like cigarettes?",false
123,Client,Really? But they're so small and fruity-flavored.,false
123,Therapist,Size and flavor don't change the fact that they're harmful. You've mentioned using them socially to relax. Have you considered quitting or cutting back?,false
123,Client,"I hadn't really thought about it causing harm. I only use them occasionally, not like daily smoking.",false
123,Therapist,"Even occasional use can cause significant damage, as we're seeing in your mouth. Quitting would help reverse this and prevent further health risks.",false
123,Client,"Well, I'll think about it.",false
123,Therapist,"That's a start. Remember, every puff puts you at risk for serious diseases. Let's discuss this again soon to see if you've made any decisions.",false
123,Client,"Alright, I'll consider it more seriously.",false
132,Therapist,"Hello again, Mr. Green. It's good to see you today. Last week we discussed your health results, and you expressed some concerns about type two diabetes and your blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Today, let's explore how you can improve these areas together. Your well-being is influenced by many factors, so I'd like us to have an open conversation about how things are going for you.",false
132,Client,"I suppose you're going to tell me I've brought this on myself and need to make changes. But I feel fine, and I enjoy my life as it is.",false
132,Therapist,"I'm here to support your decisions, Mr. Green. It's your life, and only you can decide what changes you want to make regarding your health. You mentioned the doctor suggested medication for managing your condition. How do you feel about that?",false
132,Client,"The doc said it could save my life, but I don't like the idea of taking pills forever.",false
132,Therapist,"It's understandable that you might not be thrilled about long-term medication. Today, let's focus on some lifestyle changes that can improve your health. We'll discuss smoking, diet, exercise, and weight loss. As we go through these topics, please share how you feel at each step.",false
132,Client,"Okay, where should I start?",false
132,Therapist,"That's entirely up to you. You're the expert on your own life. If you'd like my input, I can certainly provide it, but ultimately, this is about what feels right for you.",false
132,Client,"Well, I know I should quit smoking and lose weight, but it's hard to give up things I enjoy.",false
132,Therapist,Change can indeed be challenging. It's normal to feel hesitant about giving up enjoyable activities. How important is losing weight to you?,false
132,Client,"My family means everything to me. I want to be there for my children and grandchildren, not as a burden but as an active part of their lives.",false
132,Therapist,"So, being present and healthy for your family is a significant motivator for you. Where do you think you could start making changes in your lifestyle?",false
132,Client,I've been thinking about cutting down on drinking. It adds to my weight and blood pressure.,false
132,Therapist,That's a great first step. How might you support yourself in reducing alcohol intake?,false
132,Client,"I'll tell my wife about this conversation, and we can work together to make changes at home. Also, I could start having soup for lunch instead of pies.",false
132,Therapist,Those are excellent choices. A big bowl of vegetable soup can count towards your daily vegetable intake and will likely leave you feeling more satisfied than a couple of pies. What other changes might you consider?,false
132,Client,"I've already stopped adding salt to my food, which the doc said would help with blood pressure.",false
132,Therapist,"That's wonderful! You might not know this, but reducing salt intake also helps maintain bone density by preventing calcium loss. It's great that you're already making positive changes.",false
132,Client,"I'll share that information with my wife too. She loves her salt, and her mother had osteoporosis.",false
132,Therapist,"It sounds like you've made some thoughtful plans for improving your health. You're reducing alcohol intake, maintaining your reduced salt intake, and considering other lifestyle changes. When you're ready, we can discuss smoking and exercise further. How do you feel about the progress you've made so far?",false
132,Client,I feel good about taking these first steps. Let's continue at this pace and see how things go.,false
132,Therapist,That's a fantastic approach. Shall we meet again next week to continue our discussion?,false
132,Client,"Yes, that works for me.",false
132,Therapist,"Great! Until then, take care, Mr. Green.",false
132,Client,You too. Thank you.,false
4,Therapist,"Hello, Emily. It's been some time since we last spoke.",false
4,Client,"Hi, it has indeed been a while.",false
4,Therapist,"I notice you've got something new. A lip piercing, is that right?",false
4,Client,"Oh, yes, that's correct. I got it about a month ago.",false
4,Therapist,That's quite recent. What led you to decide on getting a lip piercing?,false
4,Client,"Well, I was feeling a bit bored with my usual look and thought this might be a nice change. It's been pleasant standing out more.",false
4,Therapist,"I see. And it certainly suits you. Now, as your dentist, I'd like to discuss some potential impacts of oral piercings on teeth and gums. Have you heard about any possible effects?",false
4,Client,"Not really. I'm aware it might push against my teeth or gums, but I don't know the full extent.",false
4,Therapist,"Mm-hmm. Well, one thing we've seen is that oral piercings can sometimes erode gum tissue over time. Have you noticed any changes in your gums since getting the piercing?",false
4,Client,"Not particularly, no. But I do know my gums are a bit lower than average already.",false
4,Therapist,"Yes, that's correct. And another concern is chipped teeth due to contact with the piercing. How do you feel about these potential issues?",false
4,Client,"Well, I definitely don't want it affecting my teeth negatively. I'm not great at flossing as it is, so I'll keep an eye on things.",false
4,Therapist,That's a good approach. What might make you decide that this isn't working for you anymore?,false
4,Client,"If I start seeing actual problems, then maybe I'd reconsider. But for now, I quite like how it looks.",false
4,Therapist,"It does look nice. So, you'll monitor the situation closely? Great. And remember, we're always here to discuss any concerns you have about your oral health.",false
4,Client,"Yes, thank you. I appreciate your guidance on this.",false
126,*Therapist,"* Hello, Kaylie. It looks like you're here to pick up a prescription today.",false
126,*Client,* Yeah. My doctor said he called something in.,false
126,Therapist,"Hi Kaylie, I see you're here for your prescription today. What medication did your doctor call in?",false
126,Client,"He mentioned it's cholesterol statin, but I'm not sure about the details.",false
126,*Therapist,"* Well, some of the common ones are nausea, vomiting, headache. There are some severe ones like dermatomyositis, liver failure, lupus, rhabdomyolysis, hemorrhagic cerebral infarction.",false
126,*Client,"* Okay. Um, why am I taking this medication?",false
126,Therapist,"Let's review these potential side effects together. Now, could you remind me why your doctor prescribed cholesterol statin for you?",false
126,Client,"I believe it's to manage my dyslipidemia, but I'm not entirely sure.",false
126,*Therapist,"* Oh yeah, just one tablet a day. Do you have any questions for me?",false
126,*Client,"* No, I guess not.",false
126,*Therapist,* All right. Great. Have a good day.,false
126,Therapist,"Just to confirm, it's one tablet daily. Is there anything else you'd like to ask before we wrap up?",false
126,Client,"Not at the moment, thank you.",false
10,Therapist,"Hello, it's great to meet you. I understand this is a lot to take in?",false
10,Client,"Yeah, it is.",false
10,Therapist,Can you tell me more about what brings you here today?,false
10,Client,"Well, I've just been diagnosed with diabetes and my doctor said I need to learn how to manage it better. She mentioned some serious complications if I don't...",false
10,Therapist,"It sounds like your recent diagnosis has been quite overwhelming, especially hearing about potential complications.",false
10,Client,"Yeah, it's scary. I'm not sure where to start or if I can do all this on my own.",false
10,Therapist,It's completely normal to feel that way when faced with such significant lifestyle changes. Let's break things down together and find what works best for you.,false
10,Client,[sighs],false
10,Therapist,"Your A1C levels are high, which means we need to focus on managing your blood sugar through medication, diet, weight loss, and exercise. We'll take this step by step.",false
10,Client,That's a lot... I'm not sure if I can do it all.,false
10,Therapist,It's understandable that you feel this way. Let's explore each aspect together and find practical solutions tailored to your needs.,false
7,Therapist,"So, I understand you've sprained your ankle yesterday. Could you share more about how that happened?",false
7,Client,"It's embarrassing, really. I was at a 90s-themed pub crawl, wearing stilettos, and tried to catch up with friends by jumping off a bus stairs.",false
7,Therapist,That sounds like quite an adventure.,false
7,Client,"Yeah, it was fun until my ankle gave out.",false
7,Therapist,I see. Would you be open to discussing your alcohol use in more detail this week?,false
7,Client,"Sure, though I'm still feeling last night's effects a bit.",false
7,Therapist,I understand. Let's start by exploring what a typical week looks like for you regarding alcohol.,false
7,Client,"Well, we party on weekends and have drinks after long days at university or the library.",false
7,Therapist,"So, drinking is quite common for you?",false
7,Client,"Yes, it's normal for university students.",false
7,Therapist,I see. Have you ever thought about how your drinking compares to recommended limits?,false
7,Client,"Not really. I mean, 10 drinks a week seems low for me.",false
7,Therapist,It sounds like you might be exceeding those limits. Would you consider looking at them together with me today?,false
7,Client,"Sure, but not on a Saturday morning. [chuckles]",false
7,Therapist,How about later this week or early next week? We can explore the benefits of reducing alcohol use to safer levels.,false
7,Client,That sounds good. Let's set something up.,false
7,Therapist,Great. Thank you for being open to this discussion.,false
16,Therapist,"Rick, let's revisit your living situation with Tristan. We've discussed how this program and your parents' support can help you make changes. I'd like to explore whether staying with Tristan aids or hinders these efforts. What are the advantages and disadvantages of living there?",false
16,Client,"It's a nice place, close to work, and it's great living with a mate.",false
16,Therapist,"I see. Now, considering the support you'll need for these changes, how do you think Tristan fits into that picture?",false
16,Client,"That's the thing, isn't it? I'm not sure if staying here is best for making those changes. Tristan's lifestyle doesn't align with where I want to go.",false
16,Therapist,I understand. How much has Tristan been involved in your plans and the changes you aim to make?,false
16,Client,"We've talked about it. He's supportive, but he's in a different stage of life without kids or the same responsibilities.",false
16,Therapist,"Got it. Now, let's consider moving in with your auntie and uncle. What are some pros and cons of that option?",false
16,Client,"The food would be good, and my whānau is supportive. But I'm worried about losing freedom and them taking over. I value the independence I have now.",false
16,Therapist,That's valid. How do you envision balancing this desire for freedom with reconnecting with your family and children? Is it something you're willing to negotiate?,false
16,Client,"No, not if it means losing my kids. I'll do anything to get them back.",false
13,Therapist,"Hi, Mrs. Smith. Today, we'll be discussing and possibly administering some vaccines for Lily.",false
13,Client,I'm feeling a bit uncertain about that. I've been reading up on them recently.,false
13,Therapist,I see. Can you share more about what's making you hesitant regarding vaccines?,false
13,Client,"Well, I've been thinking it might be better to let her build immunity naturally, like I did with chickenpox.",false
13,Therapist,I understand your perspective. You're considering that exposing Lily to diseases naturally could help strengthen her immune system more than vaccines would.,false
13,Client,"Yes, exactly. And I turned out fine after having chickenpox as a child.",false
13,Therapist,"That's true. However, before vaccines, natural exposure sometimes led to severe outcomes like death or lifelong disabilities from measles and polio. Would you like to hear more about these risks?",false
13,Client,"Wow, I hadn't realized it was that serious. I don't recall hearing much about polio.",false
13,Therapist,"Many of us aren't familiar with these diseases because vaccines have been so effective in eliminating them. Now that you know more, what are your thoughts on vaccinating Lily?",false
13,Client,"Well, I just want her to be safe and healthy. Maybe I should reconsider my stance on vaccines.",false
13,Therapist,It's crucial for you to make informed decisions about Lily's health. Let's continue discussing this together.,false
22,Therapist,"Today, I'd like to discuss your values clarification handout. Could you share some of your top values with me?",false
22,Client,"Sure, my number one value is family happiness, especially now. I usually do this exercise every two to three months, and it's changed each time.",false
22,Therapist,"That's interesting. So, right now, family happiness is most important to you because it feels lacking?",false
22,Client,"Yes, I want us all to be on the same page. I think if I can be more present and understanding, that could help.",false
22,Therapist,It sounds like you want them to know how much family happiness means to you.,false
22,Client,"Exactly. And religion was initially my top value, but after a significant family event, I lost some of that focus. I still have faith, but it's not as strong as before.",false
22,Therapist,"I see. So, currently, family values are your priority, and while religion is important, you're accepting that your faith might ebb and flow?",false
22,Client,"Yes, and I know others go through this too. It's normal.",false
22,Therapist,"Absolutely. Now, looking at your other values - inner harmony, health, and security - how aligned do you feel with those?",false
22,Client,Not as much as I'd like. Family happiness has taken up most of my time and energy. I've been so focused on others that I've neglected myself.,false
22,Therapist,"It's hard to find inner peace when you're always taking care of everyone else, isn't it?",false
22,Client,"Yes, and I miss the freedom and openness I had in my younger years. Something dramatic happened that changed everything.",false
22,Therapist,I'm sorry to hear that. Let's discuss how we can help you balance your priorities better next time we meet. Thank you for sharing today.,false
22,Client,Thank you for listening.,false
19,Therapist,It seems like you're at a point where you're tired of this pattern?,false
19,Client,"Yeah, I am. I can't keep shoplifting. I got caught again and now I'm suspended from school. I don't want to ruin my life over this.",false
19,Therapist,I hear how frustrated you are about this situation.,false
19,Client,"It's bad. My friends and I enjoy it, but I know I need to change.",false
19,Therapist,"You're expressing a strong desire for change, that's great.",false
19,Client,"I really do want to stop, but I don't know how. My friends are involved, and there's not much else going on in my life that's as exciting.",false
19,Therapist,It sounds like you're feeling torn between your desire for change and the enjoyment you find with your friends in this activity.,false
19,Client,"Yeah, exactly. We'd go in, steal some CDs, it was working out fine until now.",false
19,Therapist,I understand how difficult this must be for you.,false
28,Therapist,"Hi Carrie, thanks for being here today.",false
28,Client,"Thank you, my doctor recommended I come in.",false
28,Therapist,What brings you to see me?,false
28,Client,I've been struggling with smoking and really want to quit this time.,false
28,Therapist,"So, quitting is important to you right now. Can you tell me why it feels urgent?",false
28,Client,"My 15-year-old daughter is embarrassed by my smoking. Plus, my health isn't great – I have asthma, bronchitis, and early stages of emphysema. It's getting harder to breathe when I exercise.",false
28,Therapist,Being a smoker can feel like being an outcast these days. You want to set a good example for your daughter too.,false
28,Client,"Yes, exactly. She's been asking me to quit, and it's embarrassing for both of us when her friends visit.",false
28,Therapist,"So, you'd like to look good in front of others and make your daughter proud. That's understandable. You mentioned some serious health issues. Can you tell me more about that?",false
28,Client,"Well, I was diagnosed with asthma and bronchitis years ago. Recently, my doctor said I'm showing signs of emphysema too.",false
28,Therapist,That must be scary to hear. Tell me about when you first realized your breathing was becoming a problem.,false
28,Client,It was when my daughter was five. I had an episode where I couldn't breathe properly due to the humidity. She got so scared she called 911.,false
28,Therapist,That's quite a story. How did Chantix work out for you?,false
28,Client,"Not well. I had nightmares, nausea, stomach problems, and agitation. It didn't stop my cravings either.",false
28,Therapist,Those are some tough side effects. Have there been times when you were able to quit smoking completely?,false
28,Client,"Only when I was in the hospital. But even then, I'd sneak out for a cigarette.",false
28,Therapist,That's understandable. How long have you gone without smoking outside of those situations?,false
28,Client,Three days is my record. But it wasn't by choice – I couldn't smoke because I was in the hospital.,false
28,Therapist,What did you notice during those three days?,false
28,Client,"Constant thoughts about smoking. It was like a craving, similar to how a chocoholic craves chocolate.",false
28,Therapist,That's a powerful description of your nicotine addiction. Cigarettes seem to do everything you need them to – until they don't.,false
28,Client,"Yes, exactly. And now, people make assumptions about me just because I smoke. It's harder to find places where it's allowed too.",false
28,Therapist,Society has changed a lot in the past few decades. Being a smoker can feel isolating these days.,false
25,Therapist,"So, Liz, could you share something you'd like to change or perhaps feel ambivalent about at present?",false
25,Client,"I really want to restart working out. Definitely aiming for a routine, feeling healthier again.",false
25,Therapist,That's great to hear. What motivates you to make this change?,false
25,Client,"I'm tired of feeling sluggish, especially with winter approaching. I want more energy. Plus, my clothes don't fit like they used to, and I just don't feel comfortable.",false
25,Therapist,I see. You're not comfortable with how your clothes fit currently.,false
25,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
25,Therapist,Could you tell me why it's important for you to make this change?,false
25,Client,"Exercise has always made me feel good about myself. Plus, I want to set a good example for my kids. I want them to see that exercise is part of life.",false
25,Therapist,"So, feeling healthier for yourself and being a positive role model for your children are important factors.",false
25,Client,Yes.,false
25,Therapist,"If you were to start exercising more regularly, how might you go about organizing this?",false
25,Client,"I'd need to sit down with my husband and figure out a suitable time when he can watch the kids. Maybe mornings or evenings, or even weekends.",false
25,Therapist,It sounds like you want to find a balance between doing something for yourself while minimizing disruption to your family routine.,false
25,Client,"Right, yeah.",false
25,Therapist,"On a scale of 1 to 10, how important is it for you to start exercising more?",false
25,Client,I'd say an eight. It's really important to me.,false
25,Therapist,What makes it not a five or six then?,false
25,Client,"I'm just tired of being overweight and unhealthy. It doesn't make me feel good, so I'm motivated to change, but finding the time is challenging.",false
25,Therapist,"So, you're committed to making this change, feeling healthier, and setting a positive example for your family, but you're struggling with how to fit it into your schedule without disrupting everyone else's routine.",false
25,Client,Exactly.,false
25,Therapist,"Given that, what steps do you think you'll take next?",false
25,Client,I'll probably start by going for walks or runs on days when the weather is still nice. I might also look for a nearby gym with daycare facilities so I can go quickly and easily.,false
25,Therapist,That sounds like a great plan. You've got some clear options and ideas to help you get started.,false
40,Therapist,That's great to hear. How have these past three months been for you?,false
40,Client,"It's been pretty good, actually. I've managed to stay away from meth since our last session.",false
40,Therapist,That's a significant achievement. You mentioned you've made some new friends recently?,false
40,Client,"Yeah, that's right. Since I moved and started avoiding my old crowd, including my ex who used to supply me with drugs, I've been focusing on building healthier relationships.",false
40,Therapist,It sounds like you've taken some important steps in changing your environment and behaviors. How have these changes made you feel?,false
40,Client,"It's been really helpful. I've even started using the breathing exercises we practiced here, which helps calm me down when I'm feeling stressed or anxious.",false
40,Therapist,That's wonderful to hear. It seems like you're actively seeking out healthier coping mechanisms and support systems.,false
34,Therapist,"Welcome, Nina. I'm eager to understand your journey better and hear what brings you here today.",false
34,Client,My doctor sent me. He thinks I've been irresponsible about this pregnancy because of my drinking.,false
34,Therapist,I see. He's concerned about your alcohol consumption during pregnancy.,false
34,Client,"Yeah. He said it could harm the baby, but I haven't been drinking that much. Still, I'm scared I might have already messed up.",false
34,Therapist,You're worried about the potential consequences and really care about your baby's well-being.,false
34,Client,"Yes. I found out I was pregnant two months in, and by then, I'd already been drinking. It's hard to stop now, with my friends still partying every weekend.",false
34,Therapist,"So, you feel torn between your desire to be responsible and the peer pressure to keep drinking.",false
34,Client,"Yeah. I think if I talk to them, they'll understand, but it's weird being the only one having a kid among my friends.",false
34,Therapist,"It feels like you're caught between two worlds - one where you're preparing for motherhood, and another where you're still enjoying life with your friends.",false
34,Client,"Exactly. I'm not ready to give up that lifestyle yet, but I know I should.",false
34,Therapist,You're thinking about moving into the 'mom world' but also wanting to enjoy your current social life while you can.,false
34,Client,"Yes. Once the baby comes, everything will change. But for now, I want to have some fun too.",false
34,Therapist,You're concerned about what's already happened with your drinking during pregnancy. What do you know about alcohol consumption during this time?,false
34,Client,"I know it's not good, but my friends didn't seem worried, so I thought maybe it wasn't a big deal.",false
34,Therapist,"You were hoping that because your friends weren't concerned, it meant alcohol wouldn't harm the baby.",false
34,Client,Yeah. But now I realize I should've trusted my instincts and stopped drinking sooner.,false
34,Therapist,Your gut is telling you that drinking during pregnancy could be harmful to your baby.,false
34,Client,"Yes. And I really want to do what's best for my child, but it's hard when I'm around my friends who are still drinking.",false
34,Therapist,You're struggling with this dual identity - wanting to be a responsible mother and also fitting in with your social circle.,false
34,Client,"Exactly. I don't want to lose my friends because of this, but I also don't want them to think I've changed completely once I have the baby.",false
34,Therapist,You're not sure about embracing the 'picket fence' lifestyle and want to maintain some aspects of your current life.,false
34,Client,"Yes. I just turned 20, and I'm not ready to give up my friends or all the fun we have together.",false
34,Therapist,But you do want this baby and want to take care of it as it grows.,false
34,Client,"Absolutely. I kept the baby because I wanted that push towards adulthood, but now I'm scared I'm not ready for this responsibility.",false
34,Therapist,"Having this baby feels like a second chance at life, but you're worried about whether you deserve it or if you're ready.",false
34,Client,Yeah. It's like I have to take path B - giving up drinking and focusing on the baby - but I'm not sure I can do it successfully.,false
34,Therapist,"You feel like you have to take this new path because of your baby, but you're unsure about your confidence in making it a reality.",false
34,Client,"Yes. Maybe talking to my friends about it could help, or meeting other young moms who've been through the same thing.",false
34,Therapist,It sounds like you'd like some support from your parents and possibly new friends who understand what you're going through.,false
34,Client,Definitely. I just don't want to lose my current friends in the process.,false
34,Therapist,You want to maintain your friendships but also make healthier choices for yourself and your baby.,false
34,Client,"Yes, that's it exactly. I know I need to give up alcohol completely now, but I'm scared it might be too late for my baby.",false
34,Therapist,Every day without alcohol is a good day for your baby. Let's focus on making today the first of many alcohol-free days.,false
34,Client,Okay. Thank you for helping me see that it's not too late to make things right.,false
34,Therapist,"You're doing great, Nina. I'm here to support you every step of the way.",false
49,Therapist,"Welcome back, Catherine. I'm eager to hear what's been on your mind since our last meeting. What thoughts have you had about coming here today?",false
49,Client,"Well, I've thought more about why I'm here and I realize it's because of my gambling issue. It's costing me a lot of money lately.",false
49,Therapist,I see. So there's been a shift in your perspective since our last meeting?,false
49,Client,"Yes, I feel more ready to address this now.",false
49,Therapist,"That's great to hear. Today, let's discuss what you'd like to work on over the next nine months. We started talking about gambling last time, and how it's caused some tension with your family.",false
49,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
49,Therapist,You mentioned feeling like you deserved the trouble. I'm wondering if you're open to exploring that thought from different angles?,false
49,Client,"Sure, I'm up for it.",false
49,Therapist,"Great. Now, when things get uncomfortable, how do you usually handle it? How have you managed that in the past?",false
49,Client,I tend to shut down a bit.,false
49,Therapist,"I see. In our sessions, what might I notice if you're feeling uncomfortable?",false
49,Client,Probably fidgeting. That's why I'm still a bit nervous here.,false
49,Therapist,"It's okay to feel that way. To help me understand better, could you let me know when you start feeling uncomfortable? Just say, ""Ken, I'm starting to tune out.""",false
49,Client,"Okay, I'll do that.",false
49,Therapist,"Thanks for letting me know. Now, last time we talked about how you gamble more than your friends realize. How serious is this issue for you?",false
49,Client,It's really serious. I've got credit coming out of my ears and my parents won't bail me out anymore.,false
49,Therapist,"On a scale of 1 to 100, how important is it for you to sort this out?",false
49,Client,About an 80.,false
49,Therapist,And how confident are you that you can actually get it sorted?,false
49,Client,I'm completely confident. It's part of my lifestyle now.,false
49,Therapist,But how confident are you on a scale of 1 to 100?,false
49,Client,"Well, if I'm honest, probably around 60. It's hard when gambling is such a big part of my social life.",false
49,Therapist,You mentioned going out with your friends last night and gambling again. What happened then?,false
49,Client,I had to stop halfway because I'd run out of money.,false
49,Therapist,"So you're still in the behavior, creating problems for yourself. How does that make you feel?",false
49,Client,I don't know. I just want to get back on track. I don't want to spend my life in debt.,false
49,Therapist,What are your dreams? Where do you see yourself in five years?,false
49,Client,"Maybe traveling, finding the man of my dreams, and starting a family. But at this rate, I'll be pushing 30 and still in debt.",false
49,Therapist,It sounds like you're at a crossroads. You can continue with your current lifestyle or pursue other dreams. Which feels better to you?,false
49,Client,"The party girl lifestyle at 30 seems sad. I really do want to travel, especially to Egypt.",false
49,Therapist,What's stopping you from pursuing that dream?,false
49,Client,"Money, mostly. And I think I'd have to cut off some friendships because they're part of the gambling scene too.",false
49,Therapist,That could be challenging. How far away do you feel from making a change like that?,false
49,Client,It seems unrealistic right now. But I want to take the first step.,false
49,Therapist,What would that first step be for you?,false
49,Client,Cutting up my credit cards and not going to pubs with pokie machines.,false
49,Therapist,"That's a great start. We can work on managing high-risk situations like that. Now, what's one thing you can do between now and our next meeting?",false
49,Client,Find the scissors and cut up my credit cards.,false
49,Therapist,Great. And we'll also look into getting some budget advice for you.,false
49,Client,That would be helpful.,false
43,Therapist,"Welcome, Tanya. I appreciate you taking the time to meet with me today and discuss what's been on your mind.",false
43,Client,"Well, hi. I've been struggling with this anxiety around an important test I keep putting off.",false
43,Therapist,It sounds like this exam has been weighing heavily on you for some time now. Can you tell me more about how it makes you feel?,false
43,Client,"Yeah, it's just... it's always there, in the back of my mind. I'm scared I won't do well, and I don't trust myself to manage my anxiety during it.",false
43,Therapist,"So, it seems like your anxiety is creating a barrier between you and taking this exam. How confident are you on a scale of 1-10 that you can manage your anxiety around this test?",false
43,Client,"Maybe a four or five? I've taken the first step by scheduling it, but it's still really scary.",false
43,Therapist,"That's progress, Tanya. You've made an appointment before and rescheduled due to anxiety. What makes this time feel different?",false
43,Client,"It's just... it's time. I'm tired of letting this test control my life. If I don't pass, I'll retake it in three months. But if I do, that weight will be lifted.",false
43,Therapist,That's encouraging. You're focusing on the relief you'll feel afterwards. Have there been times when you felt anxious but still pushed through and succeeded?,false
43,Client,"Yeah, once at work. I had to record something, and I was terrified. But when I played it back, my supervisor and our consultant were shocked by how well I did.",false
43,Therapist,That must have boosted your confidence. How can you apply that experience to this test?,false
43,Client,"I just want to feel that pride again, you know? Like I did after the recording.",false
43,Therapist,"So, what could help move you from a four or five on the confidence scale to a seven?",false
43,Client,Practicing and seeing how I do. Having faith in myself instead of doubting my abilities.,false
43,Therapist,"It sounds like you're ready to tackle this test, Tanya. You've acknowledged your anxiety but also recognized your past successes. How does that make you feel?",false
43,Client,"Yeah, it feels good. I'm ready to get this done and prove to myself that I can do it.",false
43,Therapist,"Well said. Thank you for sharing so openly today, Tanya.",false
43,Client,Thanks for listening.,false
46,Therapist,"So, Jacob, everything seems perfectly normal based on your physical exam. Any questions for me?",false
46,Client,Nope.,false
46,Therapist,Great. I noticed you completed our alcohol and drug questionnaire. Would you be comfortable discussing it together?,false
46,Client,Sure thing.,false
46,Therapist,Excellent. What we discuss remains confidential. I'll only share with your parents if you give permission or if there's a safety concern. Understand?,false
46,Client,"Yeah, got it.",false
46,Therapist,Let's review the questionnaire then. You've mentioned using alcohol sometimes to relax and fit in. Could you tell me more about that?,false
46,Client,"It's not a big deal. Sometimes with friends, we'll have a few drinks at parties or when hanging out.",false
46,Therapist,I see. How many drinks do you usually have on those occasions?,false
46,Client,"Three or four, maybe. I don't really keep track.",false
46,Therapist,Okay. And how often does this happen?,false
46,Client,"Once or twice a month, probably.",false
46,Therapist,"So, for about six months now. What draws you to drinking alcohol?",false
46,Client,"It's just fun with friends, and it tastes good.",false
46,Therapist,"I understand. Now, are there any aspects of your alcohol use that you don't enjoy?",false
46,Client,"Yeah, the hangovers are nasty. I hate throwing up like that.",false
46,Therapist,Have you ever experienced a blackout from drinking?,false
46,Client,"No, but I've heard about it happening to others.",false
46,Therapist,Got it. Have there been any problems at home or school related to your drinking?,false
46,Client,Once I missed first period due to a hangover and got grounded for two weeks.,false
46,Therapist,"I see. You haven't ridden with someone who's been drinking or driven after drinking, right? Keep that up.",false
46,Client,"Yeah, I will.",false
46,Therapist,"As your doctor, I'm concerned about your drinking. Your brain is still developing, and alcohol can affect it significantly. Have you considered stopping?",false
46,Client,"Not really, but I guess I'm ready to give it a try.",false
46,Therapist,"That's great to hear. On a scale of zero to ten, how ready are you to stop drinking today?",false
46,Client,Probably a five.,false
46,Therapist,Why not a lower number? What makes you feel like a five?,false
46,Client,"I'm just tired of getting into trouble, I guess.",false
46,Therapist,Have you thought about what could help you avoid that trouble?,false
46,Client,"Not drinking, maybe.",false
46,Therapist,[chuckles] That's one option. Have you ever tried not drinking or stopping altogether?,false
46,Client,Nope.,false
46,Therapist,Some people try it for a while just to see how it feels. How long do you think you could go without drinking?,false
46,Client,"I don't know, maybe two months.",false
46,Therapist,That's a great start! What might make that easier for you?,false
46,Client,"Drinking something else when my friends are drinking, hanging out with non-drinking friends.",false
46,Therapist,Those are excellent strategies. Is there anyone in your life who could support you in this?,false
46,Client,"Yeah, some of my friends who don't drink would be happy to support me.",false
46,Therapist,That's wonderful. You've come up with great reasons and strategies for not drinking. I'm really proud of you. Let's make an appointment for two months from now to check in.,false
46,Client,Sounds good.,false
61,Therapist,"Good afternoon, Mrs. Smith. I'm Terri, one of the nurses working with Dr. Fields. We've met before, haven't we?",false
61,Client,"Yes, hello Terri. I remember you.",false
61,Therapist,I believe it was during your last visit that Dr. Fields mentioned trying a tai chi class to help with your balance.,false
61,Client,"That's right. I went once, but...",false
61,Therapist,And how did your first tai chi experience go?,false
61,Client,"It was beautiful and the instructor was lovely, but I felt quite self-conscious sitting in my chair while everyone else was moving around.",false
61,Therapist,"I see. So, you enjoyed the atmosphere and the instructor, but felt uncomfortable due to your current mobility limitations.",false
61,Client,"Yes, that's it exactly.",false
61,Therapist,What drew you to try tai chi initially?,false
61,Client,"Dr. Fields mentioned it might help with my balance issues. I'm still having some trouble with dizziness, so I thought it was worth a shot.",false
61,Therapist,"Your ultimate goal is to improve your balance and regain independence at home, correct?",false
61,Client,"Yes, that's what I'm working towards. I miss being able to do things on my own schedule, like going to sleep when I want or cooking for myself.",false
61,Therapist,It sounds like you're eager to return home. What steps do you believe are necessary before that can happen?,false
61,Client,The doctors said I need to be able to walk down the hall and back without assistance or dizziness. I haven't quite reached that point yet.,false
61,Therapist,And how is your physical therapy going? Are you seeing any progress there?,false
61,Client,"It's getting better, but it still hurts sometimes. I'm improving, though.",false
61,Therapist,"That's great to hear. Now, about tai chi – would you like to give it another try?",false
61,Client,"[sighs] Yes, I think I would. My friend loves it, and I want to give it a fair chance.",false
61,Therapist,What's holding you back from making the arrangements to go again?,false
61,Client,It's just complicated for me to do alone right now. I'd feel more confident if someone could help me with that.,false
61,Therapist,We can certainly assist with that. Would you like us to arrange transportation and help with scheduling?,false
61,Client,"That would be a huge help, thank you.",false
61,Therapist,"Before you leave today, let's go ahead and make those arrangements for your next tai chi class.",false
61,Client,"Thank you so much, Terri.",false
61,Therapist,"You're welcome, Mrs. Smith. I look forward to hearing about your progress when you come back in.",false
61,Client,"Okay, thank you again.",false
64,*Therapist,"* Welcome, Ricky. It's great to meet you.",false
64,*Client,* Thank you. You too.,false
64,*Therapist,* I'm glad you found us okay. Is there anything you'd like to share about your journey here?,false
64,*Client,"* No, it was straightforward. Always good to find a place easily.",false
64,*Therapist,"* That's great to hear. Now, I understand this is your first time here. Can you tell me why you've decided to come in today?",false
64,*Client,"* Sure thing. A few weeks back, some friends came over and suggested I might benefit from talking to someone about my drug use. They were concerned, and after thinking about it, I figured it couldn't hurt.",false
64,*Therapist,* It sounds like you're here because you care about your friends' concerns but aren't sure how serious the situation is. Is that right?,false
64,*Client,"* Yeah, exactly. I mean, they're my friends, so I respect what they say, but I'm not sure if it's as bad as they think.",false
64,*Therapist,* Let's explore this together then. Tell me more about your drug use. What substances are you using and how often?,false
64,*Client,"* Well, I do meth a couple of times a week, sometimes smoke weed, and occasionally take party pills on weekends.",false
64,*Therapist,"* Methamphetamine, correct? And when you say 'a couple of times a week,' what does that mean to you?",false
64,*Client,"* Yeah, meth. A couple means two or three times, I guess.",false
64,*Therapist,"* Alright. Now, let's talk about the good things about your meth use. What do you like about it? How does it make you feel?",false
64,*Client,"* Moving to Auckland opened up a whole new scene for me. I discovered this vibrant gay community and felt accepted in a way I hadn't before. Meth is just part of that scene, you know? It's fun, makes me feel good, happy, excited.",false
64,*Therapist,* So it seems meth use is linked to your social life and feeling connected. But let's also consider the other side. Are there any downsides or problems you've noticed?,false
64,*Client,"* Money's a big one. I used to have a steady acting job but that's dried up, and now I'm struggling to make rent some months. And maybe my appearance is suffering too. I dunno if I look tired or run down.",false
64,*Therapist,* It sounds like meth use might be affecting your ability to work consistently and maintain your physical health. How do you feel about that?,false
64,*Client,"* Yeah, it's worrying me a bit. I don't want to lose my friends over this either. Some of them aren't part of the scene but still care about me.",false
64,*Therapist,"* It sounds like you're starting to see some potential issues and are open to exploring them further. That's great. Now, what concerns do you have about not making any changes?",false
64,*Client,"* My acting career is really important to me, and I worry that meth use might be hurting my chances of success. Plus, I don't want to strain my relationships with my flatmates or friends.",false
64,*Therapist,"* Those are valid concerns. So, what could be a first step towards regaining control and pursuing your goals?",false
64,*Client,"* Well, maybe cutting back on weekday use. It's not like there's anyone around to party with midweek anyway.",false
64,*Therapist,* That sounds like a good start. Let's keep exploring this together at your pace.,false
70,Therapist,"Hi, Dr. Martin. I'm Lori, your pharmacist today. I hear you have some queries about citalopram. Would you like to discuss that now?",false
70,Client,"Yes, just for a couple of minutes though.",false
70,Therapist,Understood. What's on your mind regarding citalopram?,false
70,Client,"Not really specific questions, just unfamiliar with the medication.",false
70,Therapist,"I see. Citalopram is an SSRI used to manage depression. It typically starts at 20mg but comes in 10, 20, and 40mg tablets. We usually reassess symptoms after four to eight weeks. Any concerns about side effects?",false
70,Client,"Yes, what should I expect there?",false
70,Therapist,"Common side effects include gastrointestinal issues, drowsiness, or sexual dysfunction. If these arise, we can adjust the dose or consider an alternative medication. Anything else you'd like to know?",false
70,Client,How does it interact with phenelzine?,false
70,Therapist,That's a great question. Let me look into that and I'll get back to you this afternoon if that works for you?,false
70,Client,"Sure thing, thank you.",false
70,Therapist,You're welcome.,false
73,Therapist,It sounds like someone close to you introduced you to something that's been helping with your pain. Can you tell me more about that?,false
73,Client,"Yeah, my friend got me to try oxycontin. He said it was a pain medicine.",false
73,Therapist,"I see. So with his encouragement, you gave oxy a try and found it helped with some of the discomfort you've been feeling.",false
73,Client,"Mm-hmm. It's not something I do all the time, just sometimes when I'm really struggling with missing my grandma.",false
73,Therapist,That makes sense. It sounds like oxy has been helpful in managing those tough emotions and physical pain. But it also seems like you have some reservations about relying on it too much.,false
73,Client,"Yeah, exactly. I don't want to get dependent on it or anything.",false
73,Therapist,"You're being really mindful of that, which is great. It's clear there's a lot going on for you right now. Can we explore your concerns about oxy a bit more?",false
73,Client,"Sure. Like I said, I don't know much about it other than it makes me feel better.",false
73,Therapist,"Okay, so for now, you're aware that it provides some relief but you're also being cautious about its effects. That's really insightful of you.",false
76,Therapist,"Hi, Deborah. How are you doing today?",false
76,Client,"Good, I'm doing really good.",false
76,Therapist,That's great to hear. You completed your Values Clarification Sheet. Is there anything specific from that exercise you'd like to discuss?,false
76,Client,"Yeah, I found it interesting that health is my top priority. It's always been important, but now I'm actively pursuing a fitness trainer certification at Cal State.",false
76,Therapist,"That's wonderful. How does that make you feel, taking this step towards your top value?",false
76,Client,"A bit tense about the upcoming final exam, but excited too. It's a new direction for me, after being an office worker for so long.",false
76,Therapist,It sounds like health is truly driving you in this new path. Have you completed this sheet more than once before?,false
76,Client,"Yes, I have. Health has consistently been in my top three values.",false
76,Therapist,And how about inner harmony? You mentioned it's now your second priority.,false
76,Client,"Yeah, practicing yoga and meditation has really helped me find that inner peace. It's not something I've always had, but now I feel more at ease with myself.",false
76,Therapist,That's a significant shift. How does that inner harmony affect your life?,false
76,Client,"Well, it helps me prioritize my needs without feeling guilty about putting others first sometimes. It's okay to have boundaries and still be helpful.",false
76,Therapist,"So, you've found balance in helping others while also taking care of yourself. That's a valuable insight.",false
76,Client,"Yes, and service is important too. It's my third value. I enjoy being there for others, even if it means minor inconveniences for me.",false
76,Therapist,"That's very selfless of you. And wisdom, your fourth value, comes from learning about different cultures?",false
76,Client,"Absolutely. Traveling and experiencing new cultures brings me wisdom and joy. Even when things don't go as planned, I know I'll still find happiness.",false
76,Therapist,"It sounds like your values are all interconnected, creating a rich tapestry of your life's story. Is there anything else you'd like to share about them?",false
76,Client,"No, that's all for now. Thank you for listening and encouraging me today.",false
76,Therapist,"You're very welcome, Deborah. It was great talking with you too.",false
67,Therapist,May we review the form you completed? We use this with everyone who visits us.,false
67,Client,Sure thing.,false
67,Therapist,"It seems you've indicated alcohol use on a few occasions and marijuana use more frequently, about 30 days in the last year. Could you tell me more about that?",false
67,Client,"Yeah, that's right.",false
67,Therapist,"When discussing substance use with students like yourself, I prefer to explore if there are any changes one might consider, rather than telling them what to do. So, could you share your thoughts on your marijuana use?",false
67,Client,"Well, I vape it, but not the smoking kind. Just a pen.",false
67,Therapist,I see. How often would you say you vape marijuana?,false
67,Client,A few times each month.,false
67,Therapist,Have you vaped anything other than marijuana?,false
67,Client,"Once, someone shared some peppermint oil with me.",false
67,Therapist,"It's important to consider that marijuana can impact brain development and concentration, and vaping can harm your lungs. About one in six teens who start using marijuana become addicted later on. What are your thoughts on this information?",false
67,Client,I don't think it'll hurt me.,false
67,Therapist,How do you feel marijuana affects you personally?,false
67,Client,It helps me relax and laugh with friends.,false
67,Therapist,Are there any concerns or dislikes about marijuana use that you have?,false
67,Client,"I don't want to get in trouble at school, like getting suspended or kicked off the basketball team. That's important to me.",false
67,Therapist,"So maintaining your education and involvement in sports is crucial for you. When considering these factors, are there any changes you'd like to make regarding your marijuana use?",false
67,Client,I was thinking of stopping when basketball season starts.,false
67,Therapist,What benefits do you see from not using during that time?,false
67,Client,"I play better when I'm not high, and I wouldn't get caught with the pen, so no risk of getting kicked off the team.",false
67,Therapist,It sounds like you have a goal to abstain from marijuana once basketball starts. How long do you think you could maintain this?,false
67,Client,About a month.,false
67,Therapist,"On a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being not confident at all and 10 being very confident, how would you rate your confidence in achieving this goal?",false
67,Client,I'd say a seven.,false
67,Therapist,Why did you choose seven instead of a lower number like five?,false
67,Client,I'm pretty sure I can stop for a month. I really want to play well.,false
67,Therapist,What steps could help you achieve this one-month goal?,false
67,Client,"I don't know, honestly.",false
67,Therapist,"Let's consider what might trigger the urge to vape within that month. For example, feeling stressed or unhappy.",false
67,Client,"Yeah, those are times when I usually want to vape.",false
67,Therapist,What other activities could you engage in instead of vaping when feeling that way?,false
67,Client,Playing video games and basketball with my friend Sarah.,false
67,Therapist,"It's great that you have a goal and strategies to cope with triggers. If you're open to it, I'd love for you to come back in about a month so we can discuss how your plan worked out.",false
67,Client,Sure thing.,false
67,Therapist,"Good luck with basketball practice. Remember, I'm here Monday through Thursday if you need anything before our next appointment. It's always good to see you.",false
79,Therapist,It sounds like you had a significant realization recently. Can you tell me more about that?,false
79,Client,"Yeah, I was really drunk and I knew I'd screwed up big time. I felt like I'd ruined everything.",false
79,Therapist,What made you feel like you'd messed up so badly?,false
79,Client,"Because I was in the same place where I used to take pills when I got home. I wanted to stay there, but I felt guilty because Erin called me the next day and I felt ashamed talking to him.",false
79,Therapist,It seems like you were worried about putting something important at risk. Is that right?,false
79,Client,"Yeah, I guess so. I could have kept drinking every night if I wanted to, but I didn't.",false
79,Therapist,"So, you saw yourself potentially jeopardizing something valuable by continuing to drink.",false
79,Client,But I don't know why I stopped. Was it because I knew I had to or because that's where I wanted to be?,false
79,Therapist,You've been doing really well these past three months. How does it feel knowing you can see your kids now?,false
79,Client,"It feels good, yeah. That's what I was working towards.",false
79,Therapist,It sounds like this change in situation felt like a green light or at least a cautionary yellow after the red light of not being able to see them.,false
79,Client,"Yeah, that's right.",false
88,Therapist,"Let's start by setting some goals for your next 30 days. We'd like you to choose three areas you're eager to work on. Today, we'll focus on one goal that feels most pressing to you.",false
88,Client,I think I need to start getting to school on time for my first hour. I always miss that class.,false
88,Therapist,That's a great place to begin. Why is it important for you to arrive on time?,false
88,Client,"My mom's always on my case about it, and my probation officer says if I don't show up on time, they could bring me back in for sanctions.",false
88,Therapist,So avoiding sanctions is a strong motivator for you. Let's explore what might help you achieve this goal.,false
88,Client,"Well, I can't seem to wake up early enough. By the time I get ready, I miss the bus and have to walk or find a ride.",false
88,Therapist,It sounds like there are several factors contributing to your tardiness. What do you think could make the biggest difference?,false
88,Client,"If I could just get up on time, that would help a lot.",false
88,Therapist,What time would you need to wake up to catch the bus?,false
88,Client,"Around 6:15, but that's so hard because I go to bed late. I don't know if I can do it.",false
88,Therapist,"It sounds like you're feeling uncertain about whether you can stick to this new routine. Yet, you understand the importance of trying.",false
88,Client,"Yeah, I could try and see how it goes.",false
88,Therapist,"That's a great attitude. To wake up at 6:15, what time should you aim to go to bed?",false
88,Client,"If I went to bed around 11:00, that might help.",false
88,Therapist,"Okay, so you're willing to try going to bed at 11:00 and setting your alarm for 6:15. When would be a good day to start this new routine?",false
88,Client,Tomorrow or the next day.,false
88,Therapist,Let's aim for tomorrow then. Who can help support you in achieving this goal?,false
88,Client,My mom could help by waking me up if I don't get out of bed when my alarm goes off.,false
88,Therapist,"It sounds like you want your mom to remind you that this is something you're choosing to do, not just because she's telling you to. How can you respond if you feel tempted to stay up later?",false
88,Client,"Just go to bed, turn off the lights, and put my phone away.",false
88,Therapist,"Great strategies. So, how will you know your plan is working?",false
88,Client,When I'm in class on time when the bell rings.,false
88,Therapist,"That's a clear indicator of success. Let's review what we've discussed today. You're going to try getting up at 6:15 by going to bed at 11:00, with your mom's support. You'll know you're succeeding when you're in class on time.",false
88,Client,"Yeah, I'll give it a shot tomorrow.",false
82,Therapist,Shall we proceed with some questions to help you evaluate your feelings regarding alcohol and contraception?,false
82,Client,Sure thing.,false
82,Therapist,"We'll use a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is not important or confident, and 10 is very important or confident. How important is it for you to drink within safe limits?",false
82,Client,I'd say an eight.,false
82,Therapist,"You value that quite highly. Now, on the same scale, how confident are you currently in your ability to stick to those safe drinking levels?",false
82,Client,"A four, I guess.",false
82,Therapist,I see. What gives you confidence that you can drink below risk levels and remember what those are?,false
82,Client,"Well, knowing I'm at risk due to my family history of alcoholism, and I really don't want to go down that path. So, I believe I can change it now.",false
82,Therapist,That's a strong motivator for you. Anything else boosting your confidence?,false
82,Client,"Yeah, I have friends who don't drink, so when I'm with them, it's not an issue.",false
82,Therapist,"So, having supportive friends helps you maintain low-risk drinking habits?",false
82,Client,"Yes, exactly.",false
82,Therapist,"Now let's discuss birth control. On a scale of 1 to 10, how important is it for you to use effective contraception every time you have sex to prevent pregnancy?",false
82,Client,An eight.,false
82,Therapist,"You find that quite significant. How confident are you, on the same scale, in your ability to consistently use birth control correctly as prescribed?",false
82,Client,Probably a six.,false
82,Therapist,What makes you a six and not lower?,false
82,Client,"If I drink less, I'll be more reliable with using birth control. When I've had too much to drink, I don't care about it.",false
82,Therapist,So your confidence in using contraception is linked to managing your alcohol consumption. Would you like to create an action plan for your alcohol use before we wrap up today?,false
82,Client,"Sure, that'd be helpful.",false
82,Therapist,Great. We can provide additional information if needed.,false
82,Client,"Okay, thank you.",false
91,Therapist,"Hi, Jean. I'm Dr. Selby. Nice to meet you.",false
91,Client,"Good morning, doctor.",false
91,Therapist,How can I assist you today?,false
91,Client,"Well, doctor, I've recently been diagnosed with COPD, and I'm here because I want to quit smoking.",false
91,Therapist,I see. You've taken the first step by coming here today.,false
91,Client,"Yes, it's time for me to do something about this.",false
91,Therapist,You mentioned you were diagnosed three months ago. How have you been feeling since then?,false
91,Client,"I'm really scared, doctor. I haven't felt well in a while, and even simple tasks like talking on the phone leave me breathless.",false
91,Therapist,It sounds like this diagnosis has brought up some significant fears for you.,false
91,Client,"Yes, it has. I don't know what to do or where to start.",false
91,Therapist,You've set a goal of quitting in six months. How confident are you that you can achieve this?,false
91,Client,Not very. I'm only about 50% sure I can do it.,false
91,Therapist,Let's explore why you're feeling this way. What makes smoking appealing to you?,false
91,Client,"It's been a part of my life for so long, and it helps me cope with stress. Plus, everyone around me smokes too.",false
91,Therapist,"So, social connections and stress relief are important aspects of smoking for you.",false
91,Client,"Yes, that's right.",false
91,Therapist,"Now, let's consider the drawbacks. What aren't you liking about smoking these days?",false
91,Client,"It's harming my health, it's expensive, and I've noticed it's aging me prematurely.",false
91,Therapist,"On a scale of 1 to 10, how important is it for you to quit smoking right now?",false
91,Client,A definite 10. It's crucial for my health and my finances.,false
91,Therapist,"Given that importance, where would you rate your confidence in quitting?",false
91,Client,"Around 35 or 40%. I want to quit, but I'm not sure if I can.",false
91,Therapist,"What could help boost your confidence even a little bit more, perhaps to around 45%?",false
91,Client,Coming here today helped. Maybe another session or some new strategies could too.,false
91,Therapist,"That's great to hear. For now, would you be open to simply monitoring your smoking for the next week? Writing down each cigarette can make it a conscious act.",false
91,Client,"Yes, that makes sense. I'll give it a try and bring the record back to our next appointment.",false
91,Therapist,"Excellent. Thank you for coming in today, Jean.",false
91,Client,"Thank you for your help, doctor.",false
97,Therapist,"Well, Mr. Smith, that's your medication all sorted out for now.",false
97,Client,Good to hear.,false
97,Therapist,I noticed your blood pressure is a bit higher than we'd like it to be.,false
97,Client,"Yeah, I've been meaning to keep an eye on that.",false
97,Therapist,"I wanted to gently bring up the topic of your weight today, if that's alright?",false
97,Client,My weight? What about it?,false
97,Therapist,I thought it might be helpful for us to spend a few minutes discussing it.,false
97,Client,"You're joking, right? I've taken time out of my busy day to come here.",false
97,Therapist,I understand you felt your time was not respected with the wait in the reception area.,false
97,Client,"Exactly. If I make an appointment for 10:00, I expect to start at 10:00, not 45 minutes later.",false
97,Therapist,I hear that you're very busy and have many demands on your time.,false
97,Client,"Yes, I've got accounts to do, clients coming in. It's not easy for me to make time like this.",false
97,Therapist,I appreciate your effort in coming today. I wonder if we could find a way to discuss your weight briefly before you go?,false
97,Client,"I really don't have time for that right now. I'm aware of my weight and the problems it causes, but I've got too much on my plate at the moment.",false
97,Therapist,I understand this isn't an easy topic for you to discuss today.,false
97,Client,"No, it's not. I just want to get my blood pressure medication sorted and head back to work.",false
97,Therapist,I apologize for any inconvenience caused by the wait earlier. Would you be open to coming back in a couple of weeks to continue this conversation?,false
97,Client,I'll think about it. But I don't want to waste time waiting again.,false
97,Therapist,"How about if we schedule your next appointment for 8:30? That way, there should be no wait.",false
97,Client,That'd work better. I'll look at my schedule and see what I can arrange.,false
97,Therapist,Great. Let's aim to find a healthier balance in your lifestyle that fits with your busy work life.,false
97,Client,"Okay, thanks for understanding. Sorry if I seemed a bit abrupt earlier.",false
100,*Therapist,"* So, what brings you to see me today?",false
100,*Client,"* I've been struggling with my criminal history. It's making it hard for me to find work and stay on the right path. I want to be a productive member of society, but my past keeps holding me back.",false
100,*Therapist,* That sounds challenging. Can you tell me more about how your record is blocking you from getting where you want to be?,false
100,*Client,"* I'm not sure exactly what's causing the issue, but I have a felony conviction on my record.",false
100,*Therapist,* I see. How has that been affecting your job search and interviews?,false
100,*Client,"* It's tough. Even when I get an interview, once they find out about my record, it's like they don't want to hire me anymore. It's really frustrating.",false
100,*Therapist,* It sounds like you've had some experiences where you felt you were a good fit for the job but didn't get hired because of your conviction.,false
100,*Client,"* Yes, that's exactly what happens. I feel like I'm wasting my time and energy going through these interviews just to be rejected in the end.",false
100,*Therapist,"* Have you ever considered being upfront about your record before the interview, so you don't waste both your time and theirs?",false
100,*Client,* That's an interesting idea. I've never tried that approach before. I'll give it a shot next time.,false
100,*Therapist,"* Great. Now, let's talk about how this situation has been affecting your mental health.",false
100,*Client,* It's been tough. The constant rejection is taking a toll on me. I just want to feel like I'm making progress in my life.,false
100,*Therapist,* I understand. Let's work together to find ways to cope with these feelings and maintain your overall well-being while you continue your job search.,false
100,*Client,* That sounds good. Thank you for your help.,false
94,Therapist,Good day. We're here to discuss whatever's on your mind today.,false
94,Client,"I'd like to talk about this situation where I've offered my home to someone temporarily, but now it's time for them to move out.",false
94,Therapist,I see. Tell me more about that so I can better understand the dynamics at play.,false
94,Client,"Well, I've been housing this person for a while, and while I care about them, I feel it's time for them to find their own place. But I struggle with asserting myself.",false
94,Therapist,"It's commendable how you've opened your home to someone in need. Now, what makes it challenging for you to express that it's time for them to leave?",false
94,Client,"I guess I'm torn between wanting my space back and feeling guilty about asking them to go. Plus, there's comfort in having someone around.",false
94,Therapist,"So, part of you wants change but feels conflicted due to caring for this person and enjoying their company.",false
94,Client,"Yes, that's it exactly. I want to assert myself, but I'm afraid they'll take offense or feel abandoned.",false
94,Therapist,What might help you feel more confident in asking them to leave?,false
94,Client,I don't know. Maybe if I could focus on the fact that they have other options and won't be left without support.,false
94,Therapist,That's a great point. Have you discussed these alternatives with them already?,false
94,Client,"Yes, we've talked about it, and they do have some places they can go.",false
94,Therapist,It sounds like you're ready to help them pack and move on to one of those options.,false
94,Client,"I've done this before, so I know what needs to happen. I just need to follow through.",false
94,Therapist,When are you planning to make this happen?,false
94,Client,"Within the next couple of days. I have my own plans in motion too, so it's time for them to find their own space.",false
94,Therapist,It seems like you've made up your mind and are ready to see this through.,false
94,Client,"Yes, that's the plan. I just need to stick to it.",false
94,Therapist,"Well, I have a feeling your plans will come to fruition. [laughter]",false
94,Client,I appreciate your confidence in me. Let's hope so! [laughs],false
112,Therapist,"Chris, I wanted to discuss something with you. As your Athletic Director, it's my responsibility to ensure all our players are performing at their best, including you, one of our star athletes. Some concerns have arisen about a recent party where alcohol was involved, and I understand you were there.",false
112,Client,"Actually, could I share something that's been troubling me lately? Before that party, I've always been focused on my studies, but my friends convinced me to attend by playing on the fact that I'm usually too busy with homework.",false
112,Therapist,"I see. So, this party was your first experience with alcohol?",false
112,Client,"Yes, and it was... different. It helped me relax and socialize more easily. Since then, I've been going to parties more often, even skipping studying for an exam last weekend to attend one.",false
112,Therapist,That's quite a change from your usual routine. How has this affected you?,false
112,Client,"I've noticed I'm more lethargic and apathetic towards schoolwork. My mind wanders in class, especially on weekends when I should be studying but instead, I'm trying to find ways to get alcohol.",false
112,Therapist,It sounds like drinking is taking up a lot of your time and energy. What do you enjoy about it?,false
112,Client,"It helps me loosen up and engage with others more easily. But I've also noticed some negative consequences - my mom got mad at me, my focus has decreased, and I'm not doing as well in school.",false
112,Therapist,That's quite a list of changes. How have your friendships been affected?,false
112,Client,"Some friends are into the party scene, others aren't. I've been hanging out more with those who drink, but I know it's not fair to them or me because we're not as close as before.",false
112,Therapist,"Given these changes, where do you think you should go from here?",false
112,Client,I think I should stop drinking. I don't want to keep betraying my mom's trust and feeling sick afterwards. I want to regain her trust and focus on my studies and athletics again.,false
112,Therapist,"That sounds like a solid plan. On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you in making this change?",false
112,Client,"An 8 or 9. I'm determined not to let things go too far again. Even if I do drink, it won't be to the point where I feel sick.",false
112,Therapist,What's a realistic goal for you then?,false
112,Client,"Not drinking at all, or if I'm at a party, having no more than one drink maximum. That way, I can still participate in social events without compromising my goals.",false
112,Therapist,"Chris, thank you for sharing your thoughts with me today. It seems like you have a clear plan going forward. If you ever need someone to talk to or support you, please don't hesitate to reach out.",false
112,Client,Thank you for listening and understanding. It means a lot to me. I'll see you at practice later.,false
106,Therapist,"Alright, so I've prescribed an antibiotic for Aiden's ear infection. However, it seems he's had quite a few of these recently. Have you noticed this trend?",false
106,Client,"Yeah, it's been stressful for both of us. He gets really upset when it happens.",false
106,Therapist,I see. One factor that can contribute to frequent ear infections in children is smoke exposure. Are you currently smoking?,false
106,Client,"Yes, but I try not to smoke around him. I go outside or avoid smoking in the car when he's with me.",false
106,Therapist,"I understand your efforts, but Aiden's ear infections suggest he may still be exposed to smoke. Can you tell me more about his environment and who else might be smoking around him?",false
106,Client,"I-I don't know. I mean, I try my best not to expose him. I just don't want him around it because I know it's bad for him.",false
106,Therapist,"It's crucial that you quit smoking, both for your health and Aiden's. Did you know smoking around children can lead to serious issues like vitamin C deficiency, cavities, behavior problems, asthma, and even the need for ear tubes?",false
106,Client,"No, but I don't want him to grow up smoking either.",false
106,Therapist,"Exactly. Quitting now is vital for both of your futures. You're putting yourself at risk for lung cancer, heart disease, and more by continuing to smoke.",false
106,Client,"I know all that, but it's just so hard to quit. I don't know how.",false
106,Therapist,There are many tools available today to help you quit smoking. Have you considered nicotine replacement therapy like patches or gum? Or medications such as Chantix?,false
106,Client,I just don't have time for any of that right now.,false
106,Therapist,"Let's find a solution that works with your schedule. Quitting is important, and we'll figure this out together. What do you think might be a manageable first step for you?",false
106,Client,I guess I could talk to my doctor about it.,false
106,Therapist,"That's a great start. Remember, your child's health is at stake here. Let's make sure you have the support you need to quit smoking successfully.",false
106,Client,"Okay, I'll look into it more seriously.",false
106,Therapist,Thank you for considering this. We'll continue discussing strategies in our next session.,false
109,Therapist,"Great news, no cavities detected today. We'll focus on that positive step forward.",false
109,Client,That's a relief.,false
109,Therapist,"I'm glad you're pleased. However, I've noticed some irritation in your mouth, specifically nicotinic stomatitis, which is linked to tobacco use. Could we discuss how tobacco fits into your life currently?",false
109,Client,"That sounds concerning. I don't smoke cigarettes, but I do enjoy a cigarillo or two when out with friends.",false
109,Therapist,"It's commendable that you've chosen not to smoke cigarettes. However, even occasional cigarillo smoking can have health implications. How often would you say you indulge in these?",false
109,Client,"Well, it's just once or twice when I'm out with friends. Not like those heavy smokers who go through packs daily.",false
109,Therapist,"I understand your perspective, but even infrequent use can cause harm. Have you noticed any changes in your oral health recently?",false
109,Client,"Now that you mention it, my teeth do seem more stained lately. And there's the cost too, with the economy as it is...",false
109,Therapist,"Those are valid concerns. Let's explore these issues further. Are you aware that cigarillos can also pose significant health risks, similar to cigarettes?",false
109,Client,I had no idea. I never considered myself a smoker.,false
109,Therapist,"It's common to overlook these aspects when we don't identify as 'smokers'. However, the reality is that any tobacco use carries risks. How does this new understanding make you feel?",false
109,Client,"Honestly, it's quite concerning. I don't want to develop health issues like cancer.",false
109,Therapist,"Your concern is understandable. The good news is, quitting smoking can reverse these negative effects and prevent further progression of diseases.",false
109,Client,"That's encouraging. I think I could manage to quit, maybe a 7 or 8 out of 10 on the confidence scale.",false
109,Therapist,It's great that you feel confident about your ability to quit. Let's discuss strategies and support available to help you succeed.,false
109,Client,I'd appreciate that. Thank you.,false
109,Therapist,You're welcome. I'm here to support you through this process.,false
115,Therapist,"Alright, David. Let's start by rinsing. How are you feeling today?",false
115,Client,I'm doing alright.,false
115,Therapist,"That's good to hear. Now, let's take a look together and see what you think about the color. It seems there's quite a bit of staining, which brings up some concerns we might want to discuss regarding smoking habits.",false
115,Client,"Oh, I see.",false
115,Therapist,"You're aware that smoking can impact not just your overall health but also oral health, affecting dental caries and healing in your mouth?",false
115,Client,"Yeah, I've heard it all before.",false
115,Therapist,"I understand. But remember, my goal is to support you and improve your oral health. There are medications available that can help reduce cravings and make quitting easier.",false
115,Client,"I tried pills once, but they didn't work for me. They caused more side effects than anything else.",false
115,Therapist,I see. It's important to remember that it often takes several attempts before someone successfully quits smoking. Each try brings you one step closer.,false
115,Client,But it feels like everyone's just lecturing me about this.,false
115,Therapist,"I apologize if it seems that way, David. We're all here to support you because we care about your well-being. Quitting smoking is a complex process, and it's not easy.",false
115,Client,"You're right, doc. It's just hard sometimes.",false
115,Therapist,Would you be open to trying another medication with my guidance? Let's discuss how you could use it effectively.,false
115,Client,"I guess if I'm really ready, it might help.",false
115,Therapist,"That's a great attitude to have. Remember, the potential harm from smoking far outweighs any side effects from these medications.",false
115,Client,"Okay, doc. Can we continue this another time?",false
115,Therapist,"Of course, David. We'll take things at your pace. Thank you for coming in today and for listening.",false
115,Client,"Thanks for your care, doc.",false
115,Therapist,"I'm always here to help, okay? Let's schedule our next appointment.",false
121,*Therapist,"* You seem quite taken aback by this diagnosis, Mike. It doesn't quite fit with how you see your lifestyle and health.",false
121,*Client,"* Yeah, I mean, I'm active, I work hard, I don't understand why the doctor's saying I've got diabetes 2.",false
121,*Therapist,* Let's explore that together. What do you think might have led to this diagnosis?,false
121,*Client,"* Well, I guess my diet could be better. I love my coffee with sugar and milk, and I've been having a lot of it lately.",false
121,*Therapist,* It sounds like you're already thinking about some changes. Let's start small. What if we tried black coffee for a week?,false
121,*Client,* That's not so bad. I could give that a go.,false
121,*Therapist,"* Great! Now, what other aspects of your life might need some tweaking? You mentioned feeling a bit down lately.",false
121,*Client,"* Yeah, my family split up, and I've just been going through the motions at work. I haven't been taking care of myself much.",false
121,*Therapist,"* It's understandable to feel that way, but it's important to remember that self-care is crucial for your overall health. What could you do to start looking after yourself again?",false
121,*Client,"* Maybe join a club or two, get some exercise in. I used to coach rugby, maybe I could offer my services again.",false
121,*Therapist,* Those are great ideas! Let's make an appointment for a month from now to check in on your progress and see how you're feeling about these changes.,false
121,*Client,"* Okay, that sounds good. I'll hold myself accountable. Thanks, Mark.",false
121,*Therapist,"* You're welcome, Mike. Looking forward to our next session.",false
133,*Therapist,"* Welcome, Daryl. You've been here before, haven't you? Today, let's talk about your thoughts on changing your life.",false
133,*Client,"* Yeah, I guess so.",false
133,*Therapist,* You've thought about dealing again. What's that like for you?,false
133,*Client,* It'd be easy. But I know it's not right.,false
133,*Therapist,* You've been thinking about alternatives too. What's that like?,false
133,*Client,"* It's different. It's not exciting, but Fiona wants me to try.",false
133,*Therapist,"* Fiona's been with you through a lot. She has some clear ideas now, doesn't she?",false
133,*Client,"* Yeah, she does. She says it's over if I deal again.",false
133,*Therapist,* That must be tough to hear. How are things at home right now?,false
133,*Client,"* A bit tense. She's been suggesting things, but they're not what I want.",false
133,*Therapist,* You've got a friend who turned his life around too. Have you thought about talking to him?,false
133,*Client,"* Yeah, he's a drug counselor now. But I can't be like him.",false
133,*Therapist,* Why not? What do you think it would take for you to start thinking about change?,false
133,*Client,"* I don't know. It's scary. I'd need a plan, I guess.",false
133,*Therapist,* You've got Fiona and your friend who could support you. Would that help?,false
133,*Client,"* Yeah, maybe. I'll think about it.",false
133,*Therapist,"* Remember, Daryl, this is your journey. Let's take it one step at a time.",false
8,Therapist,"So, Bob, what brings you here today? How can I assist you?",false
8,Client,"Well, my wife thinks I've got a smoking problem. She's been on this health kick for six months now, and suddenly everyone who smokes is evil. That's why I'm here, just to get her off my back.",false
8,Therapist,"It sounds like you're not too thrilled about being here today, Bob.",false
8,Client,Not at all. I should be at work right now. This is costing me time and money.,false
8,Therapist,I see. Can you tell me more about your wife's concerns regarding your smoking?,false
8,Client,"She's worried about my health, keeps showing me articles about second-hand smoke. We used to enjoy a cigarette together after meals, but now I have to go outside in the cold. It's frustrating.",false
8,Therapist,"You seem quite upset about this change, Bob. It feels like your whole life has been turned upside down by her decision six months ago.",false
8,Client,"And my kids are involved too. They're ganging up on me, telling me I should quit.",false
8,Therapist,"So, you feel isolated and cornered, with everyone telling you what to do. Is that right?",false
8,Client,"Yeah. I mean, I've thought about quitting before, but I don't know if I can just stop cold turkey.",false
8,Therapist,"Let's try to understand this situation better. Your wife is pushing for change, your kids are involved, and there are some health concerns, but it seems like the main issue is that you miss how things were before she quit smoking.",false
8,Client,"Yeah, I don't want to lose my family over something like this.",false
8,Therapist,"It sounds like you're feeling stuck between a rock and a hard place. Either keep smoking as you are, or quit completely overnight. But there might be a middle ground where we can work together to gradually reduce your smoking.",false
8,Client,"So, I could do it gradually? Like taper off?",false
8,Therapist,"Yes, there are methods and medications that can help with that. It's important to recognize that quitting is a process that takes time and practice.",false
8,Client,My wife thinks I should just quit immediately. Do you think she could come to a future appointment so she can hear this too?,false
8,Therapist,"If you'd like, we can certainly arrange for her to join us in a future session.",false
8,Client,"Okay, I'll talk to her about it and call back tomorrow to set something up.",false
8,Therapist,"That sounds good. Thank you for coming in today, Bob.",false
8,Client,"Thanks, bye.",false
14,Therapist,"So, let's clarify, your goal is to reduce consumption of certain items without completely eliminating them. Is that correct?",false
14,Client,"Yeah, I guess so.",false
14,Therapist,"I appreciate how important this is to you. Let's explore your confidence level in starting this new plan. On a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is not confident at all and 10 is very confident, where would you place yourself right now?",false
14,Client,"Right now, I'd say a six.",false
14,Therapist,A six. You mentioned earlier that seeing the food at home might lower your confidence. Let's assume we're starting from a four. Why do you think you're not even lower on the scale?,false
14,Client,Because I've wanted to do this for years. It's been a goal since my teens.,false
14,Therapist,"That's quite some time. What makes you want to achieve this now, despite past challenges?",false
14,Client,"All my friends are active and healthy, but I'm not. I want to be like them, without being too thin.",false
14,Therapist,I see. Let's focus on boosting your confidence. What strategies have helped you feel more confident in the past?,false
14,Client,"I don't know, honestly. Just telling myself I can do it, I guess.",false
14,Therapist,That's a start. Let's explore a time when you successfully tackled something challenging. What strengths did you bring to that situation?,false
20,Therapist,"So, I've written a prescription for antibiotics for Aiden. However, I noticed something in his chart that's giving me pause, and I'd like to discuss it with you.",false
20,Client,Alright.,false
20,Therapist,"I see that there have been quite a few ear infections recently, and I also noticed that you mentioned smoking in the home. Could you tell me more about that?",false
20,Client,"Well, it's just Aiden and me, and yes, I do smoke. I try not to around him, but I've been smoking for years except when I was pregnant with him. Stress has been high lately, being a single mom and working full-time.",false
20,Therapist,It sounds like you're using smoking as a way to relax and cope with stress.,false
20,Client,"Yeah, some people have wine; I have cigarettes.",false
20,Therapist,You mentioned trying not to smoke around Aiden. What led you to make that decision?,false
20,Client,"I know it's not good for him. I've read about ear infections and asthma, but other kids get them too, even if their parents don't smoke.",false
20,Therapist,"So, on one hand, you're concerned about your smoking affecting Aiden, but on the other hand, you're unsure if it's truly the cause of his problems?",false
20,Client,"Right. He doesn't have asthma, and he hasn't had many other issues. I've thought about quitting before, but I just don't see how it's possible right now.",false
20,Therapist,What helped you quit smoking when you were pregnant?,false
20,Client,The idea of anything harming Aiden was terrifying. It motivated me to stop.,false
20,Therapist,But those fears don't feel as urgent now?,false
20,Client,"Not like they did then. We're two separate people, and I try my best not to smoke around him.",false
20,Therapist,"You're doing your best, but it seems there's a part of you that wants to quit smoking for good.",false
20,Client,"Yeah, I know I should, but something always gets in the way. It's on my to-do list, just not at the top.",false
20,Therapist,"On a scale of 1 to 10, how confident are you that you could quit if you tried?",false
20,Client,"A 5, I guess. I know I've done it before, but it feels really hard now.",false
20,Therapist,"You have many reasons to want to quit. You've been successful in the past, and you're feeling hesitant but not entirely hopeless.",false
20,Client,"Yeah, I'd like some help, just don't know what kind would work for me.",false
20,Therapist,"There are various options we could explore together. Some people find support groups helpful, or there are medications that can aid quitting.",false
20,Client,"I'm not keen on medication, but support sounds nice. I'm just worried about finding the time.",false
20,Therapist,I understand. Let's discuss some options that might fit better into your schedule. Would you be open to setting up another appointment to talk more about this?,false
20,Client,"That would be great, thank you.",false
20,Therapist,Perfect. We'll set something up soon.,false
11,Therapist,What else has contributed to your decision to seek help today?,false
11,Client,They discovered a small amount of cannabis in my possession.,false
11,Therapist,"I see. How much was it, if you don't mind me asking?",false
11,Client,Not much at all. Just enough for personal use.,false
11,Therapist,I understand. It sounds like this situation has been weighing on your mind.,false
11,Client,"Yeah, exactly. I wasn't planning to sell it or anything.",false
11,Therapist,"Of course not. How long do you think this process will take, given that we have about 15-20 minutes today?",false
11,Client,"Well, I just want to get whatever needs to be done, taken care of as soon as possible.",false
11,Therapist,"I appreciate your focus on moving forward. To help us make the most of our time together, would you like to use a shared agenda form? This can help us prioritize your goals and ensure we're working towards what's important to you.",false
11,Client,That sounds helpful. Let's do it.,false
26,Therapist,Let's start by discussing what's been happening lately. How have things been going?,false
26,Client,"I just want my phone call privileges back, that's all.",false
26,Therapist,I see. It seems you've had a change in your usual routine regarding phone calls. Can you tell me more about that?,false
26,Client,"[sighs] Yeah, one of the officers has it out for me or something. They took away my calls over some petty stuff like not making my bed.",false
26,Therapist,"I understand this must be frustrating. You've been a model resident here, always keeping your space tidy and treating staff with respect. Let's explore what might be happening. Is there something about your upcoming release that's causing you anxiety?",false
26,Client,I just want to contact my mom. Her birthday is tomorrow.,false
26,Therapist,"I remember how important it was for you to connect with her regularly. It must feel challenging not being able to reach out, especially during this special time. Let's try to understand why this situation has arisen. Have you noticed any changes in your feelings or behaviors lately?",false
32,Therapist,"To summarize, the Minnesota State University security report indicates that you were stopped on Stadium Road last Friday evening. You were cited for driving under the influence and subsequently taken to detox. Given your age, this is a concerning situation. Could you help me understand what happened from your perspective?",false
32,Client,"I-I'm not entirely sure, to be honest. It was a week ago now, and I had been drinking. I don't recall much.",false
32,Therapist,"I see. Your actions could potentially lead to disciplinary consequences, including suspension. How do you feel about that possibility?",false
32,Client,"Hmm. Not too concerned, really. Once I turn 21 in a few months, things will change. I'm not like my friends who drink heavily. I just need to be more careful.",false
32,Therapist,"When you decided to drive after having six beers, did you consider the potential risks? You could have caused an accident and harmed someone.",false
32,Client,"Well, I didn't though. I tried calling my roommates for a ride, but he was too tired. I had to get home somehow.",false
32,Therapist,"It's important to take responsibility for our actions, isn't it? If your partying continues like this, you may face legal issues, academic struggles, and health problems. You don't want that, do you?",false
32,Client,"No, not at all. But this wasn't my fault. Can we wrap this up? I have class soon.",false
32,Therapist,"Your actions are not aligned with the university's expectations for its students. To remain here, you'll need to demonstrate your ability to follow our rules. Do you believe you can do that?",false
32,Client,"Yeah, I get it. You're making some good points. I'll think about them.",false
32,Therapist,"Good. Your sanction will involve a period of disciplinary probation and attendance at an alcohol education seminar, which comes with a $150 fee. Further violations could result in suspension.",false
32,Client,"$150? That's steep. I'm not sure how I'll manage that. But okay, I'll deal with it.",false
23,Therapist,"Hi, Hannah. Nice to meet you.",false
23,Client,Hi.,false
23,Therapist,I understand you've been experiencing some anxiety lately and your GP thought it would be helpful for us to talk about that.,false
23,Client,"Yeah, I guess so. It's kind of been building up over the last five or six years.",false
23,Therapist,That sounds like quite a journey. Can you tell me more about how things have changed since you first noticed these feelings?,false
23,Client,"Well, I recently moved out from living with my parents for the first time. I thought it would be easier, but it's actually made things worse.",false
23,Therapist,Moving out can indeed bring new challenges. How has that change impacted your daily life and interactions with others?,false
23,Client,"It's been hard. I haven't really told anyone about how I'm feeling, so I've just been staying in a lot. I don't have many friends here yet, and my family visits aren't enough to make me feel better.",false
23,Therapist,That sounds isolating. How does that make you feel emotionally?,false
23,Client,"Scared, honestly. But hopeful too, because maybe talking about this will help.",false
23,Therapist,"It's great that you're open to seeking help today. So, let's explore how your anxiety has affected your work as a photographer.",false
23,Client,"Well, every time there's an opportunity involving people, I just turn it down. I'm worried they'll think I'm weird or incompetent.",false
23,Therapist,That must be challenging for someone who loves photography. Can you give me an example of a recent situation where you felt this way?,false
23,Client,"Two weeks ago, I had to work with a lot of people on a fashion shoot. I thought it would be fine, but then there were all these extra people and I just froze up.",false
23,Therapist,What thoughts went through your mind during that time?,false
23,Client,"I felt like everyone was looking at me, thinking I was stupid and incompetent. I couldn't breathe or focus on my work.",false
23,Therapist,That sounds incredibly overwhelming. How did you cope with those feelings in the moment?,false
23,Client,I gripped the camera tightly to try and hide how much I was shaking. I avoided eye contact and just tried to get through it as quickly as possible.,false
23,Therapist,It seems like you've developed some strategies to help manage your anxiety in these situations. Let's explore them further and see if we can find ways to make them more effective for you.,false
38,Therapist,"Hi Sarah, it's great to meet you. I'm Delwyn, your counselor here at the clinic. I heard from your nurse practitioner that we should discuss your smoking and alcohol use. Would you mind sharing some details about your recent annual exam?",false
38,Client,"Yeah, sure. Last week, my nurse practitioner mentioned she's concerned about how much I've been smoking and drinking. She suggested I try cutting back on smoking, but I'm not really worried about my drinking.",false
38,Therapist,"So, you're open to reducing your smoking but don't see a need to change your current alcohol consumption?",false
38,Client,"Exactly. I mean, I don't drink that much, and it's just a way for me to relax after work and school.",false
38,Therapist,"It sounds like you have a lot on your plate with work, being a single mom, and going back to school. Is that correct?",false
38,Client,"Yeah, it's really tiring. I'm a server, so I'm on my feet all day, and then I worry about making enough money for my son.",false
38,Therapist,It sounds like you're dealing with quite a bit of stress and financial concerns too. Tell me more about your drinking habits. How much do you typically drink in a day or week?,false
38,Client,"Well, I don't think I drink that much. Maybe two drinks a day max.",false
38,Therapist,I see. The recommended limit for women is no more than three drinks a day and seven drinks per week to minimize health risks. Have you heard about these guidelines before?,false
38,Client,"Not really. But two drinks a day doesn't seem like a problem to me, especially since some of my family members drink more.",false
38,Therapist,"I understand that it might not feel like an issue for you, but it's important to be aware of the potential risks associated with alcohol consumption. Have you noticed any changes in your drinking habits over time?",false
38,Client,"Yeah, I guess it has increased a bit lately, especially since I've been feeling more stressed out.",false
38,Therapist,It sounds like stress might be playing a role in your increasing alcohol use. Have you noticed any problems or concerns related to your drinking?,false
38,Client,"Not really. Well, sometimes I feel guilty for wanting some alone time to relax instead of spending time with my son.",false
38,Therapist,"So, there's a bit of a conflict between what you enjoy and what you think is important. It seems like changing your drinking habits might be challenging since it's part of your routine now.",false
38,Client,"Yeah, I don't want to give up something I enjoy, but I also want to be a good mom and go back to school.",false
38,Therapist,Let's explore other ways to cope with stress besides alcohol. What do you think could make a big difference in your life right now?,false
38,Client,"Probably having more reliable childcare would help a lot. My mom usually watches my son, but she can't always do it lately.",false
38,Therapist,Having consistent childcare could indeed make a significant difference. Have you looked into other affordable and reliable options?,false
38,Client,Not really. I've just relied on my mom so far.,false
38,Therapist,One of our social workers could help you explore more resources for childcare and other support services. Would you be interested in meeting with them?,false
38,Client,"Yeah, definitely.",false
38,Therapist,"Great! We can set that up. Also, would you like to meet again soon to discuss how things are going with your drinking and any progress made on finding reliable childcare?",false
38,Client,"Yes, I think that would be helpful.",false
38,Therapist,"Let's plan to meet in a couple of weeks then. Until next time, take care!",false
38,Client,"Okay, thanks. Bye.",false
44,Therapist,"Hello, Andrea. Welcome. I'm here to meet with you today about your life, goals, and behaviors. We'll chat once or twice a semester.",false
44,Client,"Hi. Okay, sure.",false
44,Therapist,Let's start. Could you tell me about yourself?,false
44,Client,"Well, I'm Andrea. I play tenor sax in the marching band, jazz band, wind ensemble. I've been involved in music for 10 years now.",false
44,Therapist,That's impressive. How long have you been playing saxophone?,false
44,Client,Four years. I started on violin and clarinet before that.,false
44,Therapist,"Ah, a versatile musician. And how about marching band? How do you enjoy it?",false
44,Client,It's fun but intense. Long summers practicing. I love the group setting and performing in competitions.,false
44,Therapist,That sounds exhilarating. Do you have many friends in band or outside of it?,false
44,Client,"Yes, both. My class friends and my band friends.",false
44,Therapist,"Great. Now, could you share a bit about your family?",false
44,Client,"I have an older brother, parents, and our golden retriever, Charlie.",false
44,Therapist,That's nice. Have you had him for long?,false
44,Client,"Yes, he's eight now.",false
44,Therapist,"After high school, what are your plans?",false
44,Client,"I want to become a doctor, focusing on psychology or psychiatry.",false
44,Therapist,"That's an ambitious goal. How about your grades? They're good, right?",false
44,Client,"Yeah, high three-point somethings.",false
44,Therapist,What do you like to do for fun on weekends?,false
44,Client,"Hang out with friends, movies, sometimes we meet at someone's house.",false
44,Therapist,"Mm-hmm. When you hang out, is there alcohol involved?",false
44,Client,"Sometimes, yeah. It depends on how much schoolwork I have.",false
44,Therapist,"So, you drink quite a bit when you do. Have you thought about the risks?",false
44,Client,Not really. We don't drive drunk or anything.,false
44,Therapist,"Okay. But you've had some heavy drinking before, right? Like that first time?",false
44,Client,"Yeah, it was mixing different things. I didn't know how much I drank.",false
44,Therapist,"Andrea, your level of drinking puts you in a high-risk group. It could lead to accidents, fights, health problems, even alcoholism.",false
44,Client,"Wow, I hadn't thought about that.",false
44,Therapist,Let's talk about making some changes. Could you quit drinking?,false
44,Client,"Yes, I think so. But it might be hard with my friends involved.",false
44,Therapist,How will you handle them asking why you're not drinking?,false
41,Therapist,"Welcome, I'm glad you could join me today.",false
41,Client,"Yes, thank you.",false
41,Therapist,How are you feeling at this moment?,false
41,Client,"Actually, I feel quite good today.",false
41,Therapist,"That's wonderful to hear. You've recently explored your values, is that correct?",false
41,Client,"Yes, it was an insightful experience. It felt different from usual. Self-respect emerged as my top value, which surprised me.",false
41,Therapist,Really? Can you tell me more about why self-respect might be so important to you now?,false
41,Client,"I think it's because I've always put others first, even at the expense of my own needs and feelings. It's like I've only just realized how much I've neglected myself. But I'm determined to change that.",false
41,Therapist,That sounds like a significant realization. How does this shift make you feel?,false
41,Client,"It feels liberating. I'm hopeful that I can respect myself as much as I do others, and in doing so, become a better person for both myself and those around me.",false
41,Therapist,"By not putting your needs on the back burner, you hope to avoid feeling stressed, resentful, or overwhelmed?",false
41,Client,"Exactly. When I'm out of alignment with my own values, I can't be the best version of myself for anyone.",false
41,Therapist,It sounds like you've been operating from a place where others' expectations have dictated your actions more than your own values.,false
41,Client,"Yes, that's exactly it. I've let what I think others want me to do influence my decisions instead of acting on my own values.",false
41,Therapist,That must have been difficult to realize. How does it feel now that you're aware of this pattern?,false
41,Client,"It's a celebration, in a way. I had an 'aha' moment where I realized I can be my own parent and give myself the things I didn't receive growing up. I can have a voice and live authentically.",false
41,Therapist,That's powerful. How does it feel to express these thoughts without feeling guilty?,false
41,Client,"It feels amazing. For the first time, I don't feel guilty for saying what I truly want and need.",false
41,Therapist,"That's fantastic. So, this change makes you feel jubilant, hopeful, and like you matter.",false
41,Client,"Yes, it does. It also makes me feel more passionate about my work as a teacher and counselor, because now it feels meaningful again, not just an obligation.",false
41,Therapist,"Your top five values include self-respect, inner harmony, family happiness, health, and achievement. Is that correct?",false
41,Client,"Yes, and I realized that creativity and freedom can come from having inner peace and self-respect. They're interconnected.",false
41,Therapist,Thank you for sharing your insights with me today.,false
41,Client,Thank you for providing a space where I could explore these thoughts.,false
35,Therapist,"Hi, Natalie. I'm Dawn.",false
35,Client,"Hello, Dawn. Nice to meet you.",false
35,Therapist,"Welcome, Natalie. Thanks for taking the time to come in today.",false
35,Client,"Thank you for having me, Dawn.",false
35,Therapist,Let's start by you telling me a bit about yourself.,false
35,Client,"Well, I'm 28 now and moved to Arizona six months ago. I love spending time with family and friends, but work keeps me quite busy. Lately, though, I've been feeling unhappy with my weight and energy levels, so I thought it'd be helpful to discuss that.",false
35,Therapist,It sounds like you're feeling a bit dissatisfied with your current health patterns.,false
35,Client,"Yes, exactly. I'm noticing I feel more sluggish, and my mood has shifted too. I think it might be related to my activity levels and diet.",false
35,Therapist,"You've noticed that when you were more active in the past, you had more energy?",false
35,Client,"Absolutely. Especially during college when I played sports. I could manage school, social life, and still have plenty of energy. Now, though, it's a struggle to find motivation after work.",false
35,Therapist,"So your days are just as full now, but your energy levels aren't what they used to be. Any ideas why that might be?",false
35,Client,"Well, in college, I had to go to practice because it was part of my scholarship. Now, it's up to me, and while I want to be more active, actually doing it seems challenging.",false
35,Therapist,You're aware that you want to make changes but struggle with the follow-through.,false
35,Client,"Yes, that's accurate. I don't want to run a marathon, but some form of regular activity would greatly improve my mood and energy levels.",false
35,Therapist,Tell me more about how physical activity affects your mood.,false
35,Client,"On active days, I'm just happier and more upbeat. Even small things like traffic don't bother me as much. It's like I've already accomplished something that day.",false
35,Therapist,You feel more accomplished and less irritated by minor annoyances on active days.,false
35,Client,"Exactly. And I hope that becoming more active will also help with my weight, which has been another concern for the past few months.",false
35,Therapist,When did you start feeling dissatisfied with your body?,false
35,Client,"About three or four months ago. My clothes started fitting tighter, and I've had a negative outlook on it since then. It's unusual for me to feel this way about my appearance.",false
35,Therapist,"It sounds like a vicious cycle, with lack of physical activity contributing to your feelings about yourself.",false
35,Client,"Yes, that's correct. I think both activity and diet play a role in how I view myself.",false
35,Therapist,You're hoping to regain the self-confidence and body image you had before.,false
35,Client,"Yes, that's my goal.",false
50,Therapist,"Let's explore your blood pressure concerns together. You mentioned feeling some agitation, but you're unsure if caffeine is truly an issue for you?",false
50,Client,"Well, sometimes coffee makes me a bit jittery and I need to use the restroom more often than my colleagues. But it helps keep me alert at work.",false
50,Therapist,"So, there are benefits like increased awareness, but also drawbacks such as potential disapproval from your coworkers or boss due to frequent bathroom breaks?",false
50,Client,"Yes, that's correct. And while my blood pressure might be high, I'm not sure if reducing caffeine would make a significant difference.",false
50,Therapist,You're currently having four cups of coffee daily. Have you considered adjusting this amount to see if it improves your agitation and blood pressure?,false
50,Client,I'd prefer not to give up my morning cup as I enjoy the ritual. But perhaps I could reduce the number of cups later in the day.,false
50,Therapist,That's a great start. You've identified one cup that you might be willing to temporarily let go of. How does that sound?,false
50,Client,It sounds manageable. I think I can do that.,false
53,Therapist,"Hi Laura. Thanks for joining me today. I'm here to chat with all students once or twice a semester, just to check in and see how things are going. We'll talk about your goals, hobbies, and any challenges you might be facing. It's casual, no pressure.",false
53,Client,Okay.,false
53,Therapist,Let's start by you telling me a bit about yourself?,false
53,Client,"I'm Laura, 17, senior in high school.",false
53,Therapist,What do you enjoy doing for fun?,false
53,Client,"Hanging out with friends on weekends, going to the mall or movies. Sometimes parties.",false
53,Therapist,"When you're with your friends, what activities do you usually engage in?",false
53,Client,"We go to games if they're school-related, hang out at someone's house, maybe go to a party later.",false
53,Therapist,That sounds like a lot of fun. Do you have any hobbies?,false
53,Client,I love reading and being outdoors. Hiking is one of my favorites.,false
53,Therapist,That's great! What are your plans after high school?,false
53,Client,"I want to apply to college, maybe study journalism or pre-law.",false
53,Therapist,Those are wonderful goals. How are you doing in school currently?,false
53,Client,Pretty good. Mostly A's and B's.,false
53,Therapist,"That's fantastic. Now, let's talk about alcohol. Have you ever had any drinks at parties?",false
53,Client,"Yes, but not often. Maybe once or twice a month at most.",false
53,Therapist,I see. Do you know the risks associated with drinking alcohol?,false
53,Client,"Yes, I'm aware of them.",false
53,Therapist,One significant risk is driving under the influence. Have you ever done that?,false
53,Client,"No, never.",false
53,Therapist,"That's great to hear. Now, let's discuss your friends. How much do they drink compared to you?",false
53,Client,Some drink more than others. My close friends don't drink as much because I'm not really interested in it.,false
53,Therapist,I understand. Being around heavy drinkers can increase your own risk of engaging in risky behaviors. Have you thought about that?,false
53,Client,"Yes, I have.",false
53,Therapist,Let's set a goal for you to quit drinking altogether.,false
53,Client,"Okay, I agree. It's not a big part of my life anyway.",false
53,Therapist,That's wonderful. Can you commit to quitting this weekend?,false
53,Client,"Yes, definitely.",false
53,Therapist,What about your friends who still drink? How will you handle that situation?,false
53,Client,"I'll try to encourage them to stop too. If they won't, I'll find other activities for us to do together that don't involve alcohol.",false
53,Therapist,"That's a great approach. Remember, if they're not supportive of your decision to quit, it might be healthier for you to distance yourself from them.",false
53,Client,"Okay, I understand.",false
53,Therapist,We've covered quite a bit today. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss or any questions you have?,false
53,Client,"No, I'm good.",false
53,Therapist,Alright then. You're free to head back to class now. Thanks for coming in and talking with me today.,false
53,Client,"Okay, thanks.",false
56,*Therapist,"* Hi, Mrs. Smith. I'm Denise, your social worker here at the clinic. I work closely with Dr. Fields and our team. Today, you had an appointment with Dr. Fields, and I wanted to reach out because I often support individuals who have similar experiences as yours, post-rehab. If that's okay with you, could we discuss how things have been going since you returned home?",false
56,*Client,* It's been pretty good.,false
56,*Therapist,* That's great to hear. What specifically are you glad about?,false
56,*Client,"* I'm just happy to be back home. My dog is there waiting for me, and it feels wonderful to be surrounded by my familiar environment again.",false
56,*Therapist,* I see. It sounds like being at home brings you a sense of comfort and joy. You've also mentioned your garden and neighbors. How have those aspects been going?,false
56,*Client,"* Well, I haven't been able to keep up with everything as much as I'd like. I've missed some physical therapy and Tai Chi sessions this week.",false
56,*Therapist,* I noticed you seemed a bit down when you mentioned that. Can we explore what might have led to you missing those appointments?,false
56,*Client,"* Yeah, well... I had a minor fall recently. It wasn't a full fall, but it was enough to make me question if I'm pushing myself too hard.",false
56,*Therapist,* I see. You've been working really hard to regain your independence and maintain your home. This fall might be a sign that you need to adjust your pace or approach.,false
56,*Client,"* Yeah, maybe I should cut back on my activities to avoid another fall.",false
56,*Therapist,* It's understandable that you're concerned about falling again. Can we explore what's making you feel this way? What are your fears and thoughts around continuing with physical therapy and Tai Chi?,false
56,*Client,"* I'm scared that if I keep pushing myself, I'll have a more serious fall, one where no one can help me.",false
56,*Therapist,* It sounds like you're feeling quite vulnerable being alone at home. Let's discuss some ways to address this concern together. Have you heard about any safety measures others use in similar situations?,false
56,*Client,"* I've seen those lifeline devices on TV, but I'm not sure if they really work.",false
56,*Therapist,* They can indeed be helpful. Would you like more information about them or other safety options we could explore together?,false
56,*Client,"* Yes, please. And maybe some support too. My daughter lives far away, and I don't want to impose on neighbors or friends.",false
56,*Therapist,"* We have case management services here that could provide regular check-ins, refresher courses on home safety, and help connect you with other resources. Would you like more details about this option?",false
56,*Client,"* Yes, thank you. And should I try going back to Tai Chi?",false
56,*Therapist,* Let's consider what activities might bring you the most benefit and enjoyment. You were very active at the senior center before. Have you thought about reaching out to them for support and companionship as well?,false
56,*Client,"* I've been a bit hesitant, but maybe it's time to give it another try.",false
56,*Therapist,"* It sounds like moving feels scary right now because of your fall. But remember, the more active we are, the less likely we are to fall in the long run. Would you be willing to work through that fear and give Tai Chi another chance?",false
56,*Client,* I'm willing to try again if it means staying safe at home with my dog and garden.,false
56,*Therapist,"* That's a strong motivation indeed. We'll continue working together, along with Dr. Fields, to help you stay safe and independent at home for as long as possible.",false
56,*Client,"* Thank you, Denise. I feel much better knowing there are options and support available.",false
56,*Therapist,"* You're welcome, Mrs. Smith. Let's keep the conversation going when you come in next time. We'll make sure those plans happen.",false
68,Therapist,"Hi, Andrea. Welcome. I'm glad you could make it today.",false
68,Client,Hello. Thank you for having me.,false
68,Therapist,Let's start by getting to know each other a bit better. Could you tell me about yourself?,false
68,Client,"Sure thing. I'm Andrea, a junior in the marching band, playing tenor sax. I also participate in wind ensemble and jazz band.",false
68,Therapist,That's impressive! You've been involved with music for quite some time now.,false
68,Client,"Yes, I started around 10 years ago on the violin before switching to tenor sax.",false
68,Therapist,How about other hobbies or activities you enjoy?,false
68,Client,"Just hanging out with friends, going to the beach, and playing board games together.",false
68,Therapist,"Got it. Now, could you share a bit about your family life?",false
68,Client,"I have an older brother who's eight years my senior, and we have a Golden Retriever named Max.",false
68,Therapist,That's wonderful. How are things going for you at school lately?,false
68,Client,Pretty good. My grades are around a 3.7 GPA.,false
68,Therapist,That's great to hear! What aspirations do you have after high school?,false
68,Client,I'd like to attend an Ivy League college and eventually become a psychiatrist or psychologist.,false
68,Therapist,"Those are big goals, Andrea. It's fantastic that you're thinking about your future. Now, let's talk about what's important to you in life. Here are some values we can discuss...",false
65,Therapist,"I see. Many people have expressed concerns about weight gain when they quit smoking, haven't they?",false
65,Client,"Yes, that's what they say. Food doesn't taste as good now, but apparently it will once I stop.",false
65,Therapist,It sounds like you're anticipating some challenges with your appetite and potentially gaining weight.,false
65,Client,"Exactly. A new wardrobe would be nice, but I'm not sure if I can afford that.",false
65,Therapist,"You've been smoking on and off for 18 years now. It's become quite integrated into your life, hasn't it?",false
65,Client,"Yes, even at times when I didn't think I'd ever smoke.",false
65,Therapist,It seems like there are several concerns weighing on you about quitting. Can we explore those together?,false
65,Client,"Sure. Withdrawal sounds terrible, and I worry about being cranky around my friends.",false
65,Therapist,Those are valid concerns. Let's add them to the list of challenges you're anticipating with quitting.,false
65,Client,"I've smoked for so long, it's hard to imagine life without it. Even though I know I should quit.",false
65,Therapist,It sounds like you're feeling quite torn about this decision. Can we explore your ambivalence together?,false
62,Therapist,How are things going for you today?,false
62,Client,"I'm doing alright, thanks.",false
62,Therapist,That's good to hear. Could you share with me what's been happening since we last spoke?,false
62,Client,"Not much, really. My caseworker mentioned something about community service hours I need to complete, but I wasn't fully paying attention.",false
62,Therapist,I see. Let's try to clarify that together. What do you remember from your conversation with your case manager about the community service requirement?,false
62,Client,"I know it needs to be done by the end of my probation, but I'm not sure how many hours are needed or if I'm supposed to find the opportunity myself.",false
62,Therapist,"Okay, let's break this down. You understand that the community service must be completed before your probation ends, but you're unsure about the specific details like the number of hours and who finds the opportunity.",false
62,Client,"Yeah, exactly. I feel confused about it all.",false
62,Therapist,Let's work through this together. Would it be helpful if I share some requirements and we discuss potential options for community service?,false
62,Client,"Yes, that would be great.",false
62,Therapist,"Excellent. You have 25 hours left to complete, which needs to happen before your probation ends. Your case manager can assist you in finding suitable opportunities. Have you considered any specific places where you might like to volunteer?",false
62,Client,I'm not sure yet. Do I have to find the community service hours myself?,false
62,Therapist,"It's encouraged that you take initiative in finding an opportunity, but your case manager is there to support and guide you through the process.",false
62,Client,"Okay, so how many hours can I complete in a weekend?",false
62,Therapist,"While it's possible to complete some hours over a weekend, spreading them out over time might be more manageable. Have you thought about using a calendar to plan your volunteer hours?",false
62,Client,That sounds helpful. I could mark down how many hours I'll do each day.,false
62,Therapist,"Exactly. With dedication and planning, it's possible to complete the required hours within a week or two during summer break. Do you have any other questions about community service?",false
62,Client,"No, that's all for now. Thank you for your help.",false
62,Therapist,"You're welcome. Remember, I'm here to support you along with your case manager. If you have more questions in the future, please don't hesitate to reach out.",false
71,Therapist,"So, you have this vision of having a partner, a home, a nice car, and being a good father. Is that correct?",false
71,Client,"Yeah, that's it.",false
71,Therapist,"Now, I'm curious how your current situation aligns with that dream.",false
71,Client,It doesn't really fit. I keep getting pulled back here for court stuff.,false
71,Therapist,That must be challenging. How does it make you feel when these things interfere with your plans?,false
71,Client,It's frustrating. It makes it harder to find a job and all that.,false
71,Therapist,I see. You've mentioned an interest in cars. Have you thought about pursuing something related to that?,false
71,Client,"Yeah, I was thinking of going back to polytech for some courses.",false
71,Therapist,That sounds like a step towards your goal. What specifically interests you about these courses?,false
71,Client,Just learning more about cars and getting hands-on experience.,false
71,Therapist,"So, if you could choose any car-related job, what would it be?",false
71,Client,"Mechanic or panel beating, something like that.",false
71,Therapist,"Got it. Now, to get this qualification, what do you think are the first steps?",false
71,Client,"I picked up some forms from polytech, but they're confusing. I don't know where to start.",false
71,Therapist,I see. It sounds like filling out these forms is a barrier for you. Let's explore that together.,false
80,Therapist,"Welcome back, Jean. It's great to see you again.",false
80,Client,"Hello, doctor.",false
80,Therapist,"I'm curious, what changes have you noticed since we last spoke?",false
80,Client,"Well, I gave that journaling a try, like we discussed. I tracked my smoking habits for a week—",false
80,Therapist,That's wonderful to hear. How did it go?,false
80,Client,"It was challenging at times, especially on the weekends when the urge to smoke felt stronger.",false
80,Therapist,"I see. So, you noticed a difference in your urges depending on the day of the week?",false
80,Client,"Yes, and I managed to cut down by two or three cigarettes during the weekdays. But then on the weekends, it was tougher to resist.",false
80,Therapist,"That's quite an accomplishment, cutting down that much in just one week. It sounds like you're really putting effort into this.",false
80,Client,Thank you. I think being honest with myself in the journal helped a lot.,false
80,Therapist,"It certainly seems to have. Now, what aspects of this process haven't gone as smoothly as you'd hoped?",false
80,Client,"The weekends are tough. When I'm out with friends or just at home with nothing much to do, it's hard not to give in to the urge to smoke.",false
80,Therapist,"I understand. So, these social situations and having free time seem to be triggers for you. Is that right?",false
80,Client,"Yes, but I've been marking them down in my journal too. I want to be honest with myself about what's really going on.",false
80,Therapist,"That's commendable. Now, have you given any thought to how you might handle these situations differently next time?",false
80,Client,"I think if I can just postpone smoking until I'm on my way to work, that could help. And maybe try not to smoke at home at all.",false
80,Therapist,"Those are great ideas. So, looking ahead to our next session, what would you like to focus on working towards?",false
80,Client,I'd like to keep up with the journaling and try to cut down another three cigarettes a day. Maybe aim for five cigarettes total each day.,false
80,Therapist,That's an ambitious goal. What strategies do you think might help you achieve that?,false
80,Client,"I can try counting my cigarettes each day, and when I get the urge, I'll fight it off until the next urge comes along.",false
80,Therapist,It sounds like you have a solid plan in place. How about we schedule our next session for a week from now to check in on your progress?,false
80,Client,"That works for me. Thank you, doctor.",false
80,Therapist,"You're welcome, Jean. We'll see you next week then.",false
83,Therapist,"Hello, Rick. Welcome.",false
83,Client,Kia ora.,false
83,Therapist,Good to see you here today. I noticed on your file that you're from down south?,false
83,Client,"Yup, that's right.",false
83,Therapist,Which part of the South Island are you from?,false
83,Client,"Invercargill, just short of Bluff. All my family is still there.",false
83,Therapist,"Ah, country boy then? How long have you been up in Christchurch now?",false
83,Client,I've been here since I was 18.,false
83,Therapist,So quite some time then. Do you have any family out here with you?,false
83,Client,Just my own whānau.,false
83,Therapist,"I see. Rick, as we're going to be working together for a while, I'm curious about what thoughts were going through your mind on your way here today?",false
83,Client,I was thinking about what you might ask me and what I'd say. I was also thinking about my kids and having to take a day off work.,false
83,Therapist,"It sounds like there's been some thought put into this visit. You've had experience with prevention services before, haven't you?",false
83,Client,"Mm-hmm, yeah.",false
83,Therapist,How has that been for you in the past?,false
83,Client,"It's been okay, not bad really. Just kind of nothing much happening.",false
83,Therapist,I see. And what brings you back here again this time?,false
83,Client,Similar stuff as before.,false
83,Therapist,"One thing I've noticed is that many people don't come inside when they reach the doors, but you did today. What does that say about you?",false
83,Client,I hope it says that I want to make some changes this time.,false
83,Therapist,That's great to hear. Is that different from your past experiences here?,false
83,Client,"Yeah, it is. I just think about my kids and how much they mean to me.",false
83,Therapist,They're really important to you then? Do you have them with you full-time?,false
83,Client,"No, I see them once a fortnight. It sucks not having them around more.",false
83,Therapist,What would you like the situation to be instead?,false
83,Client,I'd love to see them whenever I want. They're my whole world and I've let them down in the past.,false
83,Therapist,"Coming here today and working with me, how important is that for you and your children?",false
83,Client,"It's really important. If it means I can have more time with my kids, then it's 100%.",false
83,Therapist,That's a strong commitment. How do you think your kids would feel if they heard you say that?,false
83,Client,"I hope they'd be proud of me. Even though I don't want them to see me here, I hope they'd know I'm trying.",false
83,Therapist,"Your mum is still down south, isn't she? Do you think she'd be proud of you for taking these steps?",false
83,Client,"Yeah, she would. She's always been supportive.",false
83,Therapist,Would it help if we involved her and other supportive people in your journey here?,false
83,Client,I don't know. I'm not sure who to trust right now.,false
83,Therapist,"Rick, I sense that you're feeling a bit alone in this at the moment. Is that true?",false
83,Client,"Yeah, definitely. My family is down south, and up here... it's just me.",false
83,Therapist,Who do you think might be interested in supporting you on this journey?,false
83,Client,"My mum, for sure. She's always been there for me.",false
83,Therapist,How would she feel if you told her how important this is to you and your family?,false
83,Client,I think she'd tell me she loves me and believes in me. She'd want the best for my kids too.,false
83,Therapist,It sounds like having your family's support could boost your confidence a lot.,false
83,Client,"Yeah, it would. If they were there for me, I'd be 99% sure I could do this.",false
83,Therapist,"So let's focus on getting them involved and supporting you then, shall we?",false
86,Therapist,"It sounds like you're feeling quite overwhelmed by your current situation, is that right?",false
86,Client,"Yeah, I just feel helpless about this whole thing.",false
86,Therapist,You're experiencing a sense of helplessness and uncertainty about what to do next.,false
86,Client,Mm. That's it exactly.,false
86,Therapist,"It seems like you've been feeling unsupported lately, as if no one wants to help you.",false
86,Client,No one wants to help me.,false
86,Therapist,"You're feeling alone in your struggles, without the support you need.",false
86,Client,"Yeah, that's true.",false
86,Therapist,"You're expressing regret about a past decision, wishing you hadn't done it.",false
86,Client,Mm-hmm. I really shouldn't have done it.,false
86,Therapist,It sounds like you're feeling remorseful about your actions.,false
86,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
86,Therapist,You're concerned that you've lost control over certain behaviors.,false
86,Client,I couldn't help myself.,false
86,Therapist,You're worried about losing control and feel anxious about it.,false
86,Client,"Yeah, that's it.",false
86,Therapist,It's great to hear that you've had a good week. What made it fabulous for you?,false
86,Client,It's actually been a fabulous week.,false
86,Therapist,That's wonderful! What contributed to making this week so positive for you?,false
86,Client,"I know who to hang out with, I'm not stupid.",false
86,Therapist,You're aware of the importance of surrounding yourself with positive influences.,false
86,Client,Mm-hmm. But I feel like I'm letting my whole family down. They had such high hopes for me.,false
86,Therapist,You're feeling like you've fallen short of your family's expectations and let them down.,false
86,Client,"Yeah, that's it.",false
86,Therapist,"It seems like you have a clear vision for what you want in life, but things aren't going as planned.",false
86,Client,This is not what I want for my life.,false
86,Therapist,You're eager to make changes and improve your situation.,false
86,Client,Mm-hmm. I really want to get off the program.,false
86,Therapist,"It's understandable that you don't want to be here, but it sounds like you're motivated to follow the rules nonetheless.",false
86,Client,"Yeah, that's right.",false
86,Therapist,"You've been doing well with resisting smoking, even though you still crave it.",false
86,Client,"I still crave smoking, even though I've stopped.",false
86,Therapist,It takes considerable strength and determination to resist those cravings. How have you been managing them?,false
86,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
104,Therapist,"Before we wrap up, would you mind if I review the questionnaire you completed earlier?",false
104,Client,Sure thing.,false
104,Therapist,"Thank you. Let me assure you that when discussing alcohol and drugs, my role is to share information and learn about your personal goals and preferences. Does that resonate with you?",false
104,Client,"Yes, it does.",false
104,Therapist,Great. You've indicated here that you've consumed alcohol in the past year on approximately eight occasions. Can you tell me more about those instances?,false
104,Client,"Well, I mainly drink at parties. Not at home or anything like that.",false
104,Therapist,I see. What types of alcoholic beverages do you typically consume at these parties?,false
104,Client,"Usually liquor mixed with something, like vodka and orange juice or gin and tonics. Sometimes beer, but it's not my favorite.",false
104,Therapist,How many drinks would you estimate having at a typical party?,false
104,Client,"Around four to five, I guess.",false
104,Therapist,You've mentioned that drinking helps you feel relaxed. Can you elaborate on that?,false
104,Client,"Yeah, it just makes me feel more chill and comfortable around others.",false
104,Therapist,I noticed you also indicated that sometimes you forget things when you drink. What kinds of things do you tend to forget?,false
104,Client,Like how many drinks I've had or whose house I'm at. Sometimes even where I am altogether.,false
104,Therapist,"Let me share some information with you. The safest level of drinking for teens is zero, as alcohol can harm brain development and increase risks like accidents, sexual assault, and STDs. Have you ever considered how your drinking might relate to these risks?",false
104,Client,"Well, yeah. I was drinking the last time I had sex, and we didn't use a condom.",false
104,Therapist,Did you feel you gave clear consent that time?,false
104,Client,"Yeah, we've been together before and used protection then too.",false
104,Therapist,How do you think alcohol influenced your decision not to use a condom this time?,false
104,Client,We just weren't thinking about it. It's like our judgment gets clouded when we're drinking.,false
104,Therapist,"That's an important observation. Heavy drinking can indeed impair judgment and memory. Now, what aspects of drinking do you enjoy, and which ones concern you?",false
104,Client,"I like the fun and laughter that comes with it, especially when I'm with friends. But I don't like forgetting where I am or how many drinks I've had, and I definitely don't want any STDs.",false
104,Therapist,It sounds like you're aware of both the pros and cons of your drinking habits. Where would you like to go from here in terms of change?,false
104,Client,"I really don't want to drink too much again. I'm almost certain I can stick to that, maybe a nine out of ten on the readiness scale.",false
104,Therapist,That's very encouraging. Why do you think you're so ready to make this change?,false
104,Client,"Because I don't want any STDs, and I hate the uncertainty of not knowing if I have one or not.",false
104,Therapist,What steps could you take to ensure you stick to your goal of not drinking too much?,false
104,Client,I'll count my drinks and stop once I start feeling drunk. And I'll talk to this friend who thinks I drink too much – she might help keep me in check.,false
104,Therapist,That's a great start. How about ensuring safe sex practices? You mentioned you don't want unprotected sex again.,false
104,Client,"I'll talk to him and make sure we always use condoms, no matter how drunk we are.",false
104,Therapist,It sounds like you have a solid plan in place. Let's schedule another appointment for six weeks from now to check in on your progress. Does that work for you?,false
104,Client,"Yes, that sounds good. Thank you.",false
95,Therapist,"Right. Hi, Ruth, thank you for being here today. How are you feeling?",false
95,Client,"Um, I'm just... I don't know why I'm doing this anymore. I feel so stupid, like an idiot. I can't seem to find the point of any of this. It's like I keep repeating the same mistakes, even though I know they could hurt me. I've lost all my willpower, ma'am.",false
95,Client,[foreign language],false
95,Therapist,"Ruth, it sounds like you're feeling incredibly frustrated and exhausted. You feel like you've lost your motivation and strength to continue.",false
95,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
95,Therapist,Can you tell me more about why you feel that way?,false
95,Client,"It's just... cutting myself feels like the only way out sometimes. I get these suicidal thoughts, [foreign language], and I'm just so depressed. There's a lot going on at home too.",false
95,Therapist,"So you're feeling overwhelmed by all this pain and sadness, to the point where you feel like hurting yourself is your only option?",false
95,Client,"Yeah, it feels like that's the only way to handle the pain inside me.",false
95,Therapist,I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through so much pain. It must be incredibly frustrating to feel this way and not know how to make it better.,false
95,Client,"Yes, it is.",false
95,Therapist,Can you tell me more about what's happening at home?,false
95,Client,"My mom doesn't understand me, and she's a single parent. She struggles a lot, and I want to help her, but I feel like I can't. Sometimes I think if I weren't here, she'd be better off.",false
95,Therapist,"So you feel like you're a burden to your mom, and you believe that by not being around, you could make things easier for her?",false
95,Client,"Yeah, because she wouldn't have to worry about me or pay for my stuff.",false
95,Therapist,But how would she cope without you? And how are you helping her now?,false
95,Client,I try to be a good kid. I go to school and I'm not failing any classes.,false
95,Therapist,"That's great, Ruth. Even by coming here today and opening up about what you're going through, that shows you care about yourself and your mom. You want the best for both of you. But let's explore other ways to cope with this pain besides hurting yourself, okay?",false
95,Client,Okay.,false
95,Therapist,We can find healthier alternatives together. Would you be open to trying some new coping strategies?,false
95,Client,I don't know if I can...,false
95,Therapist,"It's okay, Ruth. You've taken a big step today by sharing your feelings with me. Let's take this one step at a time and see what we can discover together.",false
95,Client,"Thank you, ma'am. I feel better talking about it.",false
95,Therapist,"That's wonderful to hear, Ruth. We'll continue working on this together.",false
98,Therapist,It seems like you've given this a lot of thought. What do you think would help you avoid driving under the influence in the future?,false
98,Client,"I guess just having a plan, like calling a taxi or having money set aside for one. And maybe not drinking as much.",false
98,Therapist,That sounds like a solid strategy. How important is it for you to maintain your friendships while also prioritizing your sobriety?,false
98,Client,"It's pretty important, but I think I could take a break from them for a bit if it means getting my license back.",false
98,Therapist,That shows responsibility and commitment. We can discuss this further in our next session if you'd like.,false
98,Client,"Yeah, that would be helpful. Will these plans help me get my license back?",false
98,Therapist,"Yes, they will. Your efforts to find solutions and take responsibility for your actions are commendable.",false
113,Therapist,"Hi, Sandra. I appreciate you taking time out of your day to meet with me today.",false
113,Client,"Hi. It's just... my daughter's in the hospital too, and I want to quit smoking for her sake, but it feels hard right now.",false
113,Therapist,I hear that you're feeling torn between wanting to set a good example for your daughter and enjoying smoking. What made it possible for you to come here today despite your busy schedule?,false
113,Client,"I realized that my daughter's turning 12 soon, and some of her friends have already tried smoking. I don't want her to think it's okay because of me.",false
113,Therapist,"So, setting a positive example is really important to you. Can you tell me more about what you like about smoking?",false
113,Client,"It's relaxing, helps me socialize at work, and sometimes it even helps control my eating. But I know it's not good for me.",false
113,Therapist,Let's explore that further. What are some other benefits you find in smoking? And what concerns do you have about quitting?,false
113,Client,"Well, I enjoy it, but I worry about gaining weight if I stop. Plus, I'm used to it; it's a habit. And I don't want my daughter to start smoking because of me.",false
113,Therapist,"Today, did something happen that made you feel concerned about your daughter seeing you smoke?",false
113,Client,"This morning, she caught me having a cigarette outside our window. It felt terrible, like I was letting her down.",false
113,Therapist,That must have been difficult. How do these two parts of yourself fit together—the desire to be a good parent and the enjoyment you find in smoking?,false
113,Client,"They don't fit well at all. I want to quit, but I'm not sure how to make it work for me.",false
113,Therapist,"Let's explore that together next week. Would you be willing to come back and discuss this further? And in between, could you reflect on your top three reasons for considering quitting smoking?",false
113,Client,"Yes, I'll come back. And I'll do the homework too.",false
113,Therapist,"Thank you, Sandra. We'll see you next week.",false
116,*Therapist,"* Welcome, Molly. I'm really glad you could join me today.",false
116,*Client,* You're welcome.,false
116,*Therapist,* Thank you for coming in. Your mom mentioned some challenges you've been facing at school with peers. It sounds like they've been quite hurtful.,false
116,*Client,"* Yeah, I had to miss school twice because of the bullying. And when I'm out, rumors start spreading about me.",false
116,*Therapist,* That must be frustrating and confusing. Can you tell me more about why you think these rumors keep happening?,false
116,*Client,* I think it's because I tend to engage in conversations too much. People see that as an easy target for gossip.,false
116,*Therapist,"* When you say 'engage,' can you give me an example of what that looks like?",false
116,*Client,"* If someone tells me a rumor about myself, I press further and ask questions. Sometimes, it escalates from there.",false
116,*Therapist,* What happens when you don't let it go? How do others react?,false
116,*Client,"* They usually get more upset, and we both end up in trouble. Then I feel angry and say something back.",false
116,*Therapist,* It sounds like you're trying to manage these situations alone. Have you thought about other ways to handle them?,false
116,*Client,"* Yeah, once I just said ""This is lame"" and walked away from a conversation that was getting heated.",false
116,*Therapist,* That's great progress! What helped you do that?,false
116,*Client,"* I thought about how my mom would feel if I kept arguing. She'd be disappointed, so I tried to consider her perspective.",false
116,*Therapist,* It sounds like you're developing some self-awareness there. Let's explore more strategies together. Would you like to come back and discuss this further?,false
116,*Client,"* Yes, that would be helpful.",false
116,*Therapist,"* Wonderful. You're doing a great job navigating these challenges, Molly. Keep up the good work.",false
119,Therapist,Welcome back. Let's catch up since we last spoke.,false
119,Client,"Well, I did manage to secure an interview for a job.",false
119,Therapist,That's fantastic news!,false
119,Client,"But unfortunately, I had to cancel due to lack of childcare. It was quite disappointing as it seemed like a good fit.",false
119,Therapist,You sound understandably frustrated about having to miss that opportunity.,false
119,Client,"Yeah, and I'm worried this will keep happening unless something changes.",false
119,Therapist,"On a scale of 1 to 10, how important is finding employment for you right now?",false
119,Client,"It's a 10. I'm the sole provider for my kids, and what I'm getting from welfare isn't enough.",false
119,Therapist,You're feeling the pressure to provide for your family.,false
119,Client,"Yes, exactly.",false
119,Therapist,And how confident are you in your ability to secure a job right now?,false
119,Client,"About a 3. My resume has gaps, and I don't feel as qualified as others applying for the same jobs.",false
119,Therapist,"It sounds like childcare is a significant barrier, and improving your confidence in your employability could also help.",false
119,Client,"Yes, that's correct.",false
119,Therapist,What kind of job are you hoping to find?,false
119,Client,Something steady with good pay. I want to be home every night with my kids once they're in childcare during the day.,false
119,Therapist,So a stable job that allows you to balance work and family life.,false
119,Client,"Exactly. And ideally, it would also provide enough income so I wouldn't constantly worry about money.",false
119,Therapist,What steps do you think could help boost your confidence in finding employment?,false
119,Client,"Having reliable childcare for interviews would be a start. Also, some kind of training or certification to improve my resume and give me something to talk about in interviews.",false
119,Therapist,It sounds like gaining new skills quickly might be beneficial. Have you considered any specific fields or types of training?,false
119,Client,"I'm not sure yet. I just need something that can help me find a job now, even if it's not my long-term career goal.",false
119,Therapist,So a short-term certificate program could potentially bridge you into more stable employment.,false
119,Client,"Yes, exactly. And maybe improving my computer skills would help too.",false
119,Therapist,It seems like finding reliable childcare and boosting your confidence in interviews are top priorities right now.,false
119,Client,Absolutely. I need to find childcare resources first before anything else.,false
119,Therapist,What's the next step you'd like to take?,false
119,Client,Researching childcare options and looking into short-term training programs that could help me find a job quickly.,false
125,Therapist,"It sounds like you've had quite a challenging night with Lilly, is that right?",false
125,Client,"Yes, she was up every three hours to eat. I'm just exhausted.",false
125,Therapist,"So, Lilly needed feeding every three hours last night, and that's been really tough for you?",false
125,Client,"Yes, and it's not like I slept through the night at her age according to my mom.",false
125,Therapist,I see. You were expecting Lilly to be sleeping more through the night by now based on what your mom shared with you?,false
125,Client,"Well, I'm wondering what is considered normal for a baby of her age?",false
122,Therapist,I see you're here because your mother suggested it. How does that feel for you?,false
122,Client,"Well, I'm not really excited about being here, but whatever.",false
122,Therapist,It sounds like you're feeling a bit reluctant about this situation. Can you tell me more about what happened with your mom and your belongings?,false
122,Client,She found my stash and freaked out. I don't know why she was going through my stuff in the first place.,false
122,Therapist,That must have been upsetting for you. It sounds like you felt invaded when she went through your things without permission.,false
122,Client,"Yeah, exactly. And now here I am.",false
122,Therapist,You've recently connected with a new group of friends that you enjoy spending time with. How has that been going for you?,false
122,Client,It's been really good actually. They're cool people.,false
122,Therapist,"That's great to hear. It seems like you're finding some positivity in your life right now, despite the recent challenges with your mom.",false
122,Client,"Yeah, I guess so.",false
122,Therapist,It sounds like you're feeling quite upset with your mom for going through your belongings without your permission. Can we explore that together?,false
122,Client,"Yes, I am upset. She shouldn't have done that.",false
122,Therapist,You feel that she invaded your privacy by doing so. How does that make you want to handle things moving forward?,false
131,Therapist,Good morning. It's great that you're here today to discuss quitting smoking.,false
131,Client,Good morning.,false
131,Therapist,"To start, could you share what brings you here and what you hope we can achieve together?",false
131,Client,"Well, I'm hoping to get some medication to help me quit. And any other support you can offer would be appreciated.",false
131,Therapist,"Absolutely, we're well-equipped to assist with that. Could you remind me why you're ready to stop smoking now?",false
131,Client,"Lately, I've been smoking around 20 to 30 cigarettes a day. It's getting expensive and embarrassing, especially when I'm the only one stepping out for a smoke at social events.",false
131,Therapist,"That must feel uncomfortable. So, one reason you want to quit is that it's becoming socially isolating and costly.",false
131,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
131,Therapist,Are there any other reasons?,false
131,Client,"It's also expensive. I go through a pack a day, so that's about £7 each day.",false
131,Therapist,"That adds up quickly. So, we're looking at around £50 a week spent on cigarettes.",false
131,Therapist,Those are compelling reasons to quit. Do you feel ready to commit to stopping?,false
131,Client,"Yes, I do.",false
131,Therapist,Great. Have you thought about when you'd like your quit date to be?,false
131,Client,I'm not sure. What do you suggest?,false
131,Therapist,It often works best to choose a time when you're not facing other major stresses. What do you think might work for you?,false
131,Therapist,"Before we decide on a date, let's explore why smoking is important to you. What do you enjoy most about it?",false
131,Client,"It helps me relax and cope with stress, especially during breaks at work.",false
131,Therapist,I see. And which cigarette is the most satisfying for you each day?,false
131,Therapist,"As we prepare for your quit date, let's think about how you'll manage cravings. Have you considered using nicotine replacement therapy?",false
131,Client,"Yes, I've thought about patches.",false
131,Therapist,Patches are a popular choice. They can help manage cravings and withdrawal symptoms. We recommend using them for the full 10 to 12 weeks for the best chance of success.,false
131,Client,Okay.,false
131,Therapist,"You mentioned you'd like some follow-up support. How about we schedule another appointment, and if you're unable to come in, I'll give you a call to check in?",false
131,Client,"That sounds great, thank you.",false
