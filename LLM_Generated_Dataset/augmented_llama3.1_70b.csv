3,Client,"I've been feeling like my wife has been on my case a lot lately about improving my health habits, but to be honest, I don't really see what the issue is. With my work schedule, it's hard to eat at home every night, so I end up grabbing dinner at places like Applebee's.",false
3,Therapist,"Just to make sure I understand, you're feeling a bit puzzled by your wife's concerns about your health habits?",false
3,Client,"Yeah, I feel fine. I mean, my job is physically demanding, so I'm always on the go and sweating out anything unhealthy I might eat.",false
3,Therapist,That makes sense. It sounds like you're relying on your physical activity to balance out your diet.,false
3,Client,"Exactly. And yeah, I've gained a little weight, but it's not like I'm feeling bloated or uncomfortable.",false
3,Therapist,Have you had any recent check-ups with your doctor that might have given you some insight into your overall health?,false
3,Client,"Actually, I did go for a physical last year, and everything came back normal.",false
3,Therapist,Okay. So it sounds like you're feeling pretty confident in your current state of health?,false
3,Client,"Yeah, I am.",false
3,Therapist,And what do you think is driving your wife's concerns about your health? Do you feel like she might be worrying unnecessarily?,false
3,Client,"I know she loves me and wants the best for me, but sometimes it feels like she's being a bit too cautious. When you're working hard, it's nice to treat yourself every now and then.",false
3,Therapist,That makes sense. It sounds like you value those small indulgences as a way to cope with stress. Would you be open to learning more about how your diet might impact your health in the long run?,false
3,Client,"Yeah, sure.",false
6,Therapist,"Hi Sal, I appreciate you taking the time to come in today. How are you feeling about being here?",false
6,Client,It's no big deal.,false
6,Therapist,"Your doctor referred you to me, and I'm glad you followed up on that. Can you tell me a bit more about what led her to make that referral?",false
6,Client,"Honestly, it feels like just another thing to add to my list of problems.",false
6,Therapist,"You've made the effort to come in today, despite feeling overwhelmed. That takes a lot of courage.",false
6,Client,(nods),false
6,Therapist,Can you help me understand what some of the doctor's concerns were that led her to refer you?,false
6,Client,"I think it's just about making more changes – quitting smoking, cutting down on drinking, getting rid of my dog...I don't know what else is expected of me.",false
6,Therapist,"It sounds like there are a lot of stressors in your life right now, not just related to your asthma.",false
6,Client,"Yeah, with my wife on maternity leave and no pay, I'm the only one working. And then there's all these changes I'm supposed to make...",false
6,Therapist,That does sound overwhelming. It's like you're being asked to juggle a lot of different things at once.,false
6,Client,Exactly.,false
6,Therapist,"We have about 15-20 minutes together today, and I'd like to use that time to explore some of these issues with you. Would that be okay?",false
6,Client,"Yeah, I guess we have to start somewhere.",false
6,Therapist,One tool we can use is an agenda-setting worksheet. It helps us identify all the different things that are going on for you.,false
6,Client,Okay...,false
6,Therapist,"Just so we're clear, this isn't about making any commitments or changes right now. It's just a way to get everything out in the open.",false
6,Client,Alright.,false
6,Therapist,"So if you were to list all the things that people around you are saying you need to work on or change, what would some of those things be?",false
6,Client,Okay...,false
6,Therapist,"Remember, this is just about putting all the cards on the table. You're in control here.",false
6,Client,Alright.,false
6,Therapist,Let's start with your asthma.,false
6,Client,Yeah.,false
6,Therapist,What else comes to mind?,false
6,Client,"The fact that they want me to get rid of my dog, Oscar.",false
6,Therapist,So your dog is a big part of this. Can you tell me more about what the doctor said regarding your dog and your asthma?,false
6,Client,"They say he's making it worse, but I don't believe it. I've had him longer than my wife...",false
6,Therapist,That must be really tough to hear – being told to get rid of a pet that's so important to you.,false
6,Client,Yeah.,false
6,Therapist,It sounds like this is causing you a lot of stress right now.,false
6,Client,"Yeah, he's like my best friend.",false
6,Therapist,Okay. What about your smoking? You mentioned wanting to cut down on cigarettes?,false
6,Client,"Yeah, I've been working on quitting completely.",false
6,Therapist,And what about finances? Is that something that's been a concern for you lately?,false
6,Client,"Yeah, with all these appointments and taking time off work...",false
6,Therapist,"So it's not just the financial aspect, but also the time commitment.",false
6,Client,Exactly.,false
6,Therapist,It seems like some of these issues are interconnected. Does that make sense to you?,false
6,Client,Yeah.,false
6,Therapist,And what about your drinking? You mentioned needing to cut down on that as well.,false
6,Client,Yeah...,false
6,Therapist,"Okay, so we have a lot to consider here. Is there anything else that's been weighing on your mind lately?",false
6,Client,"No, just feeling overwhelmed by all of this.",false
6,Therapist,"If you had to choose one or two things to focus on during our time together today, what would they be?",false
6,Client,I think the thing with my dog has been really bothering me...and my asthma is out of control too.,false
6,Therapist,Okay. Those do seem closely related.,false
6,Client,Yeah.,false
6,Therapist,"Alright, let's take a closer look at those two issues and see where we can start to make some progress.",false
12,Therapist,"Sarah, I appreciate you taking the time to come in for your well-woman exam today. I'd like to explore some of your concerns further, particularly regarding your smoking habits. Would you be open to discussing this topic?",false
12,Client,"Yeah, I guess.",false
12,Therapist,Can you tell me more about your current smoking patterns? You mentioned it had increased from once or twice a day.,false
12,Client,"Normally, I smoke in the morning, during my lunch break, and then around five or six times in the evening.",false
12,Therapist,So that's approximately eight cigarettes per day. Is that correct?,false
12,Client,Yeah.,false
12,Therapist,And when did you notice an increase in your smoking habits?,false
12,Client,"Honestly, it's probably been over the past year or so.",false
12,Therapist,I see. And is there a particular time of day when you tend to smoke more frequently?,false
12,Client,"Yeah, usually after my two-year-old son goes to bed. I try not to smoke around him.",false
12,Therapist,That makes sense. It sounds like you're using smoking as a way to unwind in the evening.,false
12,Client,"Exactly. With my crazy schedule and night classes, it's one of the few times I have to myself.",false
12,Therapist,I understand. What else do you typically do in the evenings to relax?,false
12,Client,"Um, maybe I'll have a drink or two.",false
12,Therapist,"Okay. Can you estimate how many drinks you have per day, and perhaps over the course of a week?",false
12,Client,"Um, maybe like two max...I don't know why you're asking me that, though. I just came here for a regular visit.",false
12,Therapist,"I apologize if it seems unrelated, Sarah. As your healthcare provider, my goal is to ensure you have all the resources necessary to meet your goals and maintain good health. I'm not here to tell you what to do, but rather to share information and listen to your thoughts.",false
12,Client,"Yeah, I guess.",false
12,Therapist,"We know that increased smoking and alcohol consumption are associated with various health concerns, including certain types of cancer and heart disease. I'd like to discuss these risks with you and explore ways to mitigate them.",false
12,Client,Yeah...,false
12,Therapist,What are your initial thoughts on this information? You mentioned earlier that you don't smoke or drink as much as others.,false
12,Client,"Well, I'm just kinda surprised because I feel like I've been trying to keep it pretty low.",false
12,Therapist,It sounds like you're making a conscious effort to cut back. Can you rate your readiness to stop smoking on a scale of 0 to 10?,false
12,Client,"Um, maybe like a five.",false
12,Therapist,You chose a five rather than a four. What led you to that decision?,false
12,Client,"Well, hearing about the potential health risks and being a mother...I don't want anything to happen to me.",false
12,Therapist,"That's understandable. Given these concerns and your goals, what steps might you consider taking to move closer to quitting smoking?",false
12,Client,"Well, I could maybe try to cut back in the evenings a little bit.",false
12,Therapist,Let's quantify that goal. How many cigarettes would you aim to reduce your evening smoking by?,false
12,Client,"Well, right now, if I'm having like five or six, I could try to smoke three in the evening plus still the couple during the day.",false
12,Therapist,That's a significant reduction. Would you be willing to come back in four weeks to review your progress and discuss further strategies?,false
12,Client,"Yeah, sure.",false
12,Therapist,"Great. We can also go over your laboratory results at that time. In the meantime, would you like some information on smoking cessation techniques?",false
12,Client,"Yeah, I think that would be very helpful.",false
12,Therapist,I have a brochure here with some useful tips and distraction techniques for managing nicotine cravings.,false
12,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
12,Therapist,"Additionally, I'd like to recommend that you speak with one of our counselors, Dr. Kirtley, who specializes in discussing the association between alcohol and stress.",false
12,Client,What exactly would we be talking about?,false
12,Therapist,"As your healthcare provider, I want to ensure you're aware of the recommended guidelines for women's alcohol consumption. The National Guidelines suggest no more than seven drinks per week to minimize health risks.",false
12,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
12,Therapist,"Since your current consumption is slightly higher, I think it would be beneficial to discuss this further with Dr. Kirtley.",false
12,Client,"I mean, I would like to talk about my stress, but I'm still not sure about the drinking thing.",false
12,Therapist,"That's completely understandable. Before you leave today, we'll schedule an appointment for you to see me in four weeks and also set up a meeting with Dr. Kirtley.",false
12,Client,Okay.,false
12,Therapist,Is there anything else you'd like to discuss or ask before our next appointment?,false
12,Client,I don't think so.,false
12,Therapist,"It was nice meeting you, Sarah. I'll see you in a month.",false
12,Client,Okay.,false
21,Therapist,"Hi Laura, thanks for coming in today. I want to make sure you're comfortable with what we'll be discussing.",false
21,Client,Hi.,false
21,Therapist,"Before we begin, I'd like to give you a brief overview of our conversation. We'll explore your goals and aspirations, discuss some behaviors that might impact those goals, and see how I can support you in achieving them.",false
21,Client,Okay.,false
21,Therapist,"Just to clarify, my role is not to judge or try to change you, but rather to understand your perspective and offer guidance when needed.",false
21,Client,Alright.,false
21,Therapist,Can you tell me a bit about yourself?,false
21,Client,"Well, I'm 17 years old, a senior in high school, and hoping to attend college soon.",false
21,Therapist,What are some things you're looking forward to accomplishing in your life?,false
21,Client,"Getting good grades, going to college, and maybe studying pre-law.",false
21,Therapist,That sounds like an exciting path. Have you considered where you might want to go for college?,false
21,Client,"I'm not sure yet, but possibly a few schools in the area or out-of-state.",false
21,Therapist,Keeping your options open is great. What do you think about when it comes to studying pre-law?,false
21,Client,"It's just something that interests me, and I'd like to explore it further.",false
21,Therapist,That makes sense. Can you tell me a bit more about what you enjoy doing in your free time?,false
21,Client,"I like hanging out with friends, going to parties or the mall, and attending school events.",false
21,Therapist,It sounds like you value social connections and having fun. Do you have a close-knit group of friends or a larger circle?,false
21,Client,"I'd say it's moderate – not extremely popular, but not isolated either.",false
21,Therapist,Being part of a community is important to you. How do your grades look right now?,false
21,Client,"They're pretty good, mostly As and Bs.",false
21,Therapist,"That's great to hear. Now, I want to explore some values that might be important to you. Can you take a look at this list and see which ones resonate with you?",false
21,Client,"Family, friendship, and belonging are all important to me.",false
21,Therapist,What does family mean to you?,false
21,Client,It means having people who care about me and accept me for who I am.,false
21,Therapist,That's beautiful. Do you have any siblings?,false
21,Client,"Yes, one sister.",false
21,Therapist,How do you think friendship fits into your life?,false
21,Client,"Having close friends is important to me, and I value being a good friend in return.",false
21,Therapist,Belonging was another value that stood out to you – can you tell me more about what that means?,false
21,Client,It's just feeling like I fit in and am accepted by others.,false
21,Therapist,"That makes sense. Now, let's talk about drinking. Have you ever had any experiences with alcohol?",false
21,Client,"Not much, maybe one or two drinks at most.",false
21,Therapist,Can you tell me more about how alcohol fits into your social scene?,false
21,Client,It's just something that's often present when I'm hanging out with friends or at parties.,false
21,Therapist,You mentioned feeling pressure from others to drink – can you elaborate on that?,false
21,Client,"Yeah, sometimes people will ask why I'm not drinking, so it feels easier to just have a drink to fit in.",false
21,Therapist,That makes sense. How often do you think you're around alcohol?,false
21,Client,Maybe one or two weekends a month at most.,false
21,Therapist,What kind of situations are you usually in when there's alcohol present?,false
21,Client,"Just hanging out with friends, parties, or small gatherings.",false
21,Therapist,Have you ever been in a situation where someone was driving after drinking?,false
21,Client,"No, I've never drunk-driven and wouldn't get in a car with someone who had been drinking.",false
21,Therapist,That's great to hear. What do you think about the risks associated with underage drinking?,false
21,Client,It's definitely not something I take lightly – I know it can lead to accidents and other problems.,false
21,Therapist,How does your family feel about drinking?,false
21,Client,"They don't really condone it, especially since I'm still in high school.",false
21,Therapist,That makes sense. What do you think might happen if you were to stop drinking altogether?,false
21,Client,It wouldn't be a big deal for me – I don't drink much anyway.,false
21,Therapist,"Looking ahead to the future, how do you see drinking fitting into your life?",false
21,Client,Probably not at all – I have big plans and don't want anything to get in the way of achieving them.,false
21,Therapist,"That's great. On a scale of 1-10, how important is it for you to make some adjustments to your drinking habits?",false
21,Client,"Maybe a 5 or 6 – it's not something that's constantly on my mind, but I do think about it sometimes.",false
21,Therapist,How confident are you that you could make changes if you decided to?,false
21,Client,Pretty confident – I'm not really into the whole drinking scene anyway.,false
21,Therapist,What kind of goal might be good for you to set in terms of your drinking habits?,false
21,Client,"Maybe stopping altogether, at least for now.",false
21,Therapist,That sounds like a great goal. What benefits do you think you'll experience if you follow through with that?,false
21,Client,"I'll have all my senses about me, and it's better for my health.",false
21,Therapist,Those are both excellent reasons. Is there anything else you'd like to talk about or any concerns you have?,false
21,Client,"No, I think I'm okay.",false
21,Therapist,"Alright, well, let's plan on meeting again in a few weeks to check in and see how things are going.",false
21,Client,"Okay, that sounds good.",false
21,Therapist,"And if you run into any challenges, we can work through them together.",false
21,Client,Sounds like a plan.,false
24,Therapist,"Hi, how can I support you today?",false
24,Client,"Yeah, I hope so. My workplace just went smoke-free and it's really frustrating me. I plan to keep smoking, but I was wondering if there are any strategies that could help me cope with this change.",false
24,Therapist,It sounds like the new policy is causing some distress for you. Can you tell me more about your concerns?,false
24,Client,"No, I'm not going to quit smoking. I enjoy it and it helps me relax. I don't see why it's a big deal.",false
24,Therapist,I'd like to understand how smoking fits into your daily routine. This will help us explore ways to manage the impact of the new policy.,false
24,Client,"I smoke about half a pack a day, which isn't too bad. I've been smoking for five years, but I'm confident I could quit if I wanted to.",false
24,Therapist,"It seems like smoking is an important part of your life right now, and you're not ready to make any changes. However, you feel capable of quitting in the future if you choose to.",false
24,Client,"Yeah, I can quit whenever I want.",false
24,Therapist,What gives you confidence that you could quit if you decided to?,false
24,Client,"Well, I just think it's something I could do if I wanted to. Although I've never tried to quit before, smoking is mostly a social thing for me – during breaks at work or after work with friends.",false
24,Therapist,"On a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 means you're not considering quitting and 10 means you're ready to quit, where would you place yourself?",false
24,Client,"I'd say I'm around a 2. Until the announcement at work today, quitting wasn't even on my radar.",false
24,Therapist,What led you to choose a 2 instead of a 1?,false
24,Client,I guess anything is possible. Maybe I could be convinced to quit if there were good reasons to do so. Are there any strategies or tools that might help me want to quit smoking?,false
24,Therapist,There are many products and medications available that can help reduce nicotine cravings and withdrawal symptoms when quitting or cutting down.,false
24,Client,"That's helpful to know. I'm not ready to take action today, but it's reassuring to have options if I decide to quit in the future.",false
24,Therapist,"Looking back at the scale, what do you think would need to happen for you to move from a 2 to a 4 or 5?",false
24,Client,"If my friends were quitting with me, that might make a difference. But most of my friends smoke, so I don't see that happening anytime soon.",false
24,Therapist,"Now that your workplace is going smoke-free, it's possible some colleagues may be planning to quit as well.",false
24,Client,That's a good point – I hadn't thought of that. Maybe there will be people at work who can support me if I decide to quit in the future.,false
24,Therapist,It seems like you're looking for information and options today. I'm happy to help you explore those when you're ready.,false
24,Client,"Okay, thanks a lot.",false
27,Therapist,"I sense that your asthma symptoms have been particularly challenging lately, and it's essential we explore ways to manage them effectively so you can avoid future hospitalizations.",false
27,Client,"Yeah, I definitely don't want to come back here. But my doctor mentioned that Oscar, my dog, might be connected to my asthma symptoms, which seems ridiculous since I've had him for 12 years without any issues.",false
27,Therapist,"You sound surprised by this information. Have you reviewed the materials provided by the clinic about managing your asthma, particularly regarding pets as potential triggers?",false
27,Client,"Yeah, I have seen the materials and even read them. However, all I've been doing is taking my medication, so I don't feel like I know much about it.",false
27,Therapist,It seems that you're feeling a bit uncertain about how to proceed. Can you help me understand what you mean by saying you don't know much about managing your asthma?,false
27,Client,(no change),false
27,Therapist,"I'm struck by the fact that, despite having a young baby and being concerned about your health, you've already taken significant steps towards quitting smoking. Now, it's essential to address the potential impact of your dog on your asthma.",false
27,Client,"This is all feeling a bit overwhelming. My main concern is my own health, not my baby's – he doesn't have any issues with Oscar. It's just me who has asthma.",false
27,Therapist,"I understand that you're worried about your own well-being, Sal. Your recent asthma attacks are concerning, and it's crucial to acknowledge the potential risks associated with severe asthma. As your healthcare provider, it's my duty to emphasize the importance of taking this seriously.",false
27,Client,"So, you're saying Oscar could be life-threatening? But I've had him for 12 years without any major issues, and now the doctor is suggesting other factors like stress or finances might be contributing to my symptoms.",false
27,Therapist,"Sal, it's essential to recognize that your asthma has been progressing over time. While medication can help manage your symptoms, there may come a point where it's no longer sufficient. Have you considered how this could impact your overall health and well-being?",false
27,Client,"They can just keep giving me stronger medicine, and I'll keep Oscar.",false
27,Therapist,"Sal, we're already at the upper limit of medication strength. If keeping Oscar is that important to you, I want to understand what that means in relation to your priorities – does his importance outweigh that of your baby or wife?",false
27,Client,"I understand your concerns, but I don't think you fully grasp my situation. I've had this dog for 12 years, and it's not something I can just get rid of without being certain it's the main cause of my symptoms.",false
27,Therapist,(no change),false
36,Therapist,"Good morning, Barbara. I'm Dr. Betty, one of the new GPs in the practice. How would you like me to address you?",false
36,Client,"You can call me Barbara, thank you.",false
36,Therapist,"Great, Barbara. I understand you usually see Dr. Brown, but he's not available today. Is that correct?",false
36,Client,"Yes, Dr. Brown is my doctor.",false
36,Therapist,What brings you here today? What are your concerns about your health?,false
36,Client,I've been having terrible trouble with my stomach and Dr. Brown hasn't been able to figure out what's wrong. I thought maybe a fresh perspective could help.,false
36,Therapist,Can you tell me more about these tummy problems you're experiencing?,false
36,Client,"It's just constant discomfort, bloating, constipation, diarrhea... sometimes it feels like stabbing pains. And the smell of my gas is just awful.",false
36,Therapist,That sounds incredibly distressing. How long have you been dealing with these symptoms?,false
36,Client,"I think it started after a holiday in Egypt about four years ago. I had a bad bout of sickness and diarrhea, and my stomach has never been right since then.",false
36,Therapist,Have you tried any treatments or remedies for this condition?,false
36,Client,"Dr. Brown gave me some muscle relaxants at first, but they didn't help much. I've also tried various herbal remedies from the health shop, and I always carry Immodium with me just in case.",false
36,Therapist,How do you decide which tablets to take on a given day?,false
36,Client,"It depends on how my stomach is feeling that day. If I'm having a bad day, I might try something different.",false
36,Therapist,Have you had any tests or investigations for these symptoms?,false
36,Client,"Yes, I had a gastroscopy and barium enema early on, but they didn't find anything wrong.",false
36,Therapist,How did you feel about those test results?,false
36,Client,"To be honest, I felt like Dr. Brown gave up on me after that. He said there was nothing more he could do, and I don't think he's done enough to help me.",false
36,Therapist,It sounds like you're feeling a bit frustrated with the lack of progress in your treatment.,false
36,Client,"Yeah, I just feel like there must be something more they can do for me.",false
36,Therapist,Can you tell me how these symptoms have affected your daily life?,false
36,Client,"Well, it's had a huge impact. I used to work full-time, but now I'm not working at all because of the discomfort and anxiety about my stomach.",false
36,Therapist,That must be really tough for you. What do you miss most about your old life?,false
36,Client,"I miss my friends from work, and we used to go out together all the time. I also miss exercising and going out with my husband.",false
36,Therapist,It sounds like these symptoms have really limited your social life and activities.,false
36,Client,"Yeah, it's been a big change for me.",false
36,Therapist,Have you noticed any patterns or triggers that make your symptoms worse?,false
36,Client,"Actually, yes. When my husband is away on business, I tend to feel worse. And sometimes when I'm stressed or anxious, my symptoms seem to get worse too.",false
36,Therapist,That's interesting. What do you think Dr. Brown thinks might be causing your symptoms?,false
36,Client,"He says it's all in my head, that it's just stress.",false
36,Therapist,How do you feel about that explanation?,false
36,Client,I don't think it can be just stress. The pain is too real for that.,false
36,Therapist,Have you had any thoughts yourself about what might be causing your symptoms?,false
36,Client,"Well, sometimes I wonder if it's an infection that never cleared up, or maybe irritable bowel syndrome like my friend has.",false
36,Therapist,What do you hope to get out of our conversation today?,false
36,Client,I was hoping you could offer a fresh perspective and maybe suggest some new tests or treatments that Dr. Brown hasn't tried yet.,false
36,Therapist,"I understand where you're coming from, Barbara. However, based on what you've told me, I'm not sure that more tests would be the most useful approach at this point.",false
36,Client,So you think it's all in my head too?,false
36,Therapist,"No, I don't think that. What I do think is that sometimes our physical symptoms can be influenced by our mental state and life circumstances.",false
36,Therapist,Can you see how your symptoms might be linked to what's going on in your mind and life?,false
36,Client,I'm not sure... I just know the pain feels real.,false
36,Therapist,"That's understandable. What if we tried a different approach, focusing on your daily activities and stress levels? Maybe that could help alleviate some of your symptoms.",false
36,Client,"Hmm, I suppose it couldn't hurt to try.",false
36,Therapist,Would you be willing to work with me for the next few months to see if this new approach makes any difference?,false
36,Client,"Well, two or three months is a long time... what if there's something serious going on that we're missing?",false
36,Therapist,"I understand your concerns, Barbara. But if we do decide to try this new approach, I'll be seeing you regularly and monitoring your symptoms closely.",false
36,Client,Okay... I suppose it couldn't hurt to try.,false
36,Therapist,Great! Let's schedule a follow-up appointment for next week and go from there. Can you also make a list of the tablets you're taking so we can review them together?,false
36,Client,"Yeah, okay.",false
33,Therapist,"David, how are you feeling today?",false
33,Client,I'm doing pretty well.,false
33,Therapist,Would you like to take a look at this?,false
33,Client,"Yeah, check it out.",false
33,Therapist,What do you think about what you see?,false
33,Client,It looks nice. You fixed the discoloration that was there.,false
33,Therapist,"Yes, but I did notice some staining. What are your thoughts on what might be causing that?",false
33,Client,"The usual things - smoking, wine, coffee...",false
33,Therapist,Have you considered quitting smoking at this time?,false
33,Client,"Yeah, I've thought about it, but it's not easy.",false
33,Therapist,It sounds like you feel like you're being lectured by everyone to quit smoking.,false
33,Client,"Yeah, that's how it feels. I'm not an idiot; I know the risks.",false
33,Therapist,I apologize if my approach came across as lecturing. That wasn't my intention.,false
33,Client,"I know you're just trying to help, but it's hard to quit.",false
33,Therapist,"If quitting were easy, everyone would do it. What's been your experience with smoking in the past?",false
33,Client,"I've smoked for 40 years, since I was 14. I've tried quitting a few times, but it didn't stick.",false
33,Therapist,It sounds like you feel like you've tried everything and nothing has worked.,false
33,Client,"Yeah, that's right. I don't see myself changing now.",false
33,Therapist,You feel like cold turkey is the only way to quit for good.,false
33,Client,"Yeah, that's what my friends who have quit say too.",false
33,Therapist,It's your choice whether or not to quit smoking. Can you tell me more about what might motivate you to quit if you decided to?,false
33,Client,"Honestly, I'm not sure. Even having open-heart surgery and prostate cancer didn't make me want to quit.",false
33,Therapist,You feel like those experiences should have been enough to make you want to quit.,false
33,Client,"Yeah, but they weren't.",false
33,Therapist,"If there was a situation that would make you decide to quit smoking, what would it be?",false
33,Client,"I don't know. Like I said, nothing seems to work for me.",false
33,Therapist,You feel like quitting is something you'll have to do on your own terms.,false
33,Client,"Yeah, that's right.",false
33,Therapist,Would it be okay if we discussed this again at our next visit? I'm concerned about your health.,false
33,Client,"Okay, yeah. I'm always open to listening.",false
33,Therapist,As long as I don't lecture you too much?,false
33,Client,"[laughs] Yeah, just keep that in mind.",false
33,Therapist,"[chuckles] Don't worry, I will. You're glad to have a supportive doctor like your surgeon.",false
33,Client,"Yeah, he's good. He cares about my health.",false
33,Therapist,"We'll work with you wherever you are on this issue, David.",false
33,Client,"Okay, thanks doc.",false
33,Therapist,Thanks for taking the time to talk about smoking today.,false
33,Client,"No problem, thanks.",false
42,Therapist,"It sounds like you're feeling really frustrated with your weight loss progress, despite putting in a lot of effort through exercise and other activities. Can you tell me more about what's not working for you?",false
42,Client,"I'm just having trouble losing the rest of the weight. No matter how much I try to exercise or run, it doesn't seem like anything is changing.",false
42,Therapist,"So, you've reached a plateau in your weight loss journey, and despite increasing your physical activity, you're not seeing the results you want on the scale?",false
42,Client,"Exactly. And I'm confused because I keep trying different exercises, but nothing seems to be working.",false
42,Therapist,"It sounds like you feel like you're putting in a lot of effort without getting any payoff. You're doing more exercise, but it's not translating into weight loss results that you can see on the scale?",false
42,Client,"Yes, that's exactly how I feel.",false
42,Therapist,And that's really discouraging for you?,false
42,Client,"Yeah, and to make matters worse, when I try to talk about it with my family, they don't seem to care or offer any support. It feels like no one is on my side.",false
42,Therapist,"You're feeling a bit isolated in this struggle, like you're going through it alone without anyone to turn to for help or encouragement?",false
42,Client,"Yeah, that's how I feel.",false
42,Therapist,"And when you do try to reach out to your family members, they don't seem to be giving you the kind of support you need. Can you tell me more about what that's like for you?",false
42,Client,"Specifically with my dad, he doesn't just not want to support me - he actually thinks I should gain weight back.",false
42,Therapist,That must be really tough for you to hear. Can you help me understand more about why your dad might think that way?,false
42,Client,"It feels like he thinks I'm trying to change who I am to fit some kind of ideal, but really I just want to be healthy and feel good in my own body.",false
42,Therapist,Tell me more about what's behind his concerns. What do you think he means by that?,false
45,Therapist,"Hi Mary, how's your day been so far?",false
45,Client,It's fine. Where do I need to sign?,false
45,Therapist,You can sign right there. I sense that you might not be in the best mood today.,false
45,Client,Not really.,false
45,Therapist,Okay. I noticed you missed your first hour of class today. Can you tell me a bit about what happened?,false
45,Client,"Yeah, whatever. It's just the same thing every day.",false
45,Therapist,It seems like that's not a big concern for you right now.,false
45,Client,"No, it's just like...I don't know why I bother.",false
45,Therapist,You're wondering what the point of these visits is and why I'm asking you all these questions?,false
45,Client,"Yeah, exactly. Why are you asking me this stuff?",false
45,Therapist,Would you be open to me explaining again what this program is about and how it can support you?,false
45,Client,I guess so.,false
45,Therapist,"Just to clarify, my role as your caseworker is to check in with you daily, make sure you're following the rules, and get to know you better. Can that feel a bit intrusive at times?",false
45,Client,"Yeah, it feels like you just want to know my business.",false
45,Therapist,I understand how it might seem that way. But I want you to know that I care about your well-being and success.,false
45,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
45,Therapist,"When we first met, you mentioned wanting to get off this program as quickly as possible. Is that still a goal for you?",false
45,Client,Yeah.,false
45,Therapist,"So, being here when you need to be is one way to work towards that goal.",false
45,Client,I guess so.,false
45,Therapist,"Yet, it seems like you're still feeling a bit frustrated about having to do this.",false
45,Client,Yeah. I don't know if I can promise I'll always be here.,false
45,Therapist,You're concerned about being able to follow the rules and succeed in this program?,false
45,Client,"No, it's just...why do you need to know all this stuff?",false
45,Therapist,"It can feel overwhelming with so many people involved in your life right now, including the courts and your mom.",false
45,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
45,Therapist,And there are a lot of rules to follow. That can be tough.,false
45,Client,"Yeah, it's just too much.",false
45,Therapist,Some clients have told me that they didn't realize how much they valued their freedom until it was taken away.,false
45,Client,Right. I wish I had my freedom back.,false
45,Therapist,What are some ways you think you could work towards getting your freedom back?,false
45,Client,"Like, signing the papers when you come by.",false
45,Therapist,That's one step. Are there other things you could do to move closer to that goal?,false
45,Client,Not doing what I did again so I don't have to deal with all this.,false
45,Therapist,"So, not wanting to go through this experience again is motivating you to make positive changes.",false
45,Client,Yeah.,false
45,Therapist,I appreciate your effort in signing the paperwork even when it feels annoying. Thank you for that.,false
45,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
45,Therapist,"Before I leave today, is there anything else you'd like to add or share with me?",false
45,Client,Not really.,false
45,Therapist,"Okay, well, I'll see you later today then.",false
45,Client,All right.,false
45,Therapist,All right. Bye for now.,false
45,Client,Bye.,false
54,Therapist,"Hi Scott, welcome to our session today. I'm glad you're here.",false
54,Client,Hi.,false
54,Therapist,You mentioned earlier that you wanted to discuss exercising. Can you tell me more about what's been on your mind?,false
54,Client,"Yeah, I do want to talk about it.",false
54,Therapist,What seems to be the challenge for you in getting back into a regular exercise routine?,false
54,Client,"Well, I just can't seem to get back in the gym. I used to work out quite a bit, and over the last couple of years, I've stopped going. I got busy, and now I'm out of the habit.",false
54,Therapist,It sounds like you're feeling a bit stuck. Would it be helpful to explore some reasons why getting back into exercise is important to you?,false
54,Client,Okay... All right...,false
54,Therapist,Can you tell me which gym you currently belong to?,false
54,Client,The Sport Fitness Center.,false
54,Therapist,How far away is the gym from your house?,false
54,Client,Just a couple of miles.,false
54,Therapist,"That's relatively close. Have you considered incorporating physical activity into your daily routine, such as walking or biking to the gym?",false
54,Client,"If I walked that far, I probably wouldn't even need to go to the gym, right?",false
54,Therapist,"While walking is great exercise, it's also important to consider other aspects of fitness, like weightlifting and strength training. Can you tell me why those things are important to you?",false
54,Client,It-it would be important.,false
54,Therapist,What motivates you to want to get back into exercising regularly? Is there a specific goal or outcome you're hoping for?,false
54,Client,"Well, I'd feel better. My clothes wouldn't be as tight. I've been growing around the middle and I'd like to get back to where I was.",false
54,Therapist,It sounds like you're looking for both physical and emotional benefits from exercising. Can you tell me more about what that means to you?,false
54,Client,I-I'm more comfortable when I feel better physically. That's the main thing.,false
54,Therapist,"Your health and well-being are certainly important considerations. While it's great that you want to look good, your overall health is a key priority.",false
54,Client,Yeah... I'm not getting any younger...,false
54,Therapist,You've had success with exercising in the past. What do you think would help you get back into a regular routine now?,false
54,Client,I've gotta make time.,false
54,Therapist,"That's a great insight. Making time for exercise might mean adjusting your daily schedule, such as waking up earlier to fit it in.",false
54,Client,Yeah... Okay...,false
54,Therapist,"When we meet next, I'd like you to experiment with getting up an hour earlier and trying to incorporate exercise into your routine. Can you bring that list of reasons why exercising is important to you?",false
54,Client,Okay.,false
54,Therapist,Great! I'll see you next week then.,false
54,Client,Okay... Very good... Thanks.,false
54,Therapist,"You're welcome, Scott. Take care until next time.",false
54,Client,Bye.,false
51,Therapist,Can you share your understanding of the flu shot and its purpose?,false
51,Client,"I know the flu can be serious, but since I'm generally healthy, I don't think I need it. It seems like it's more for older adults or those with weaker immune systems.",false
51,Therapist,"Just to make sure I understand, you're thinking that the flu vaccine is primarily recommended for people who are more susceptible to illness?",false
51,Client,"Yes, that's right.",false
51,Therapist,"May I take a moment to share some additional information about the flu vaccine and its importance, and see if it might change your perspective?",false
51,Client,That's okay with me.,false
51,Therapist,"As you mentioned, being young and healthy does reduce your risk of complications from the flu. However, certain groups, such as older adults, pregnant individuals, and infants, are more vulnerable to serious consequences. By getting vaccinated, you can help prevent the spread of the flu to those around you who may be at higher risk.",false
51,Client,Okay.,false
51,Therapist,"Now that we've discussed this further, how do you feel about considering the flu vaccine?",false
51,Client,"Well, my grandparents might not handle the flu well if they got it, and I also have a coworker who is pregnant...",false
51,Therapist,I see.,false
51,Client,"So, yeah, I guess getting vaccinated would be a good idea, especially for their sake.",false
51,Therapist,"It sounds like you're considering the potential impact on those around you who may be more vulnerable to illness, and that's influencing your decision about getting the flu shot.",false
57,Therapist,"Mr. Johnson, I'd like to discuss your cholesterol levels and the medication prescribed by your doctor.",false
57,Client,Yeah?,false
57,Therapist,I'm here to help you understand how to use your medication effectively and provide information on maximizing its benefits.,false
57,Client,"Honestly, I'm not sure if I'll take the medicine. I know I have high cholesterol, but I'm concerned about the potential side effect of muscle weakness, which could impact my job as a truck driver.",false
57,Therapist,Can you tell me more about what's worrying you about taking this medication?,false
57,Client,"Well, I've got to haul heavy boxes on dollies, and I just can't afford to have any muscle weakness. That's my main concern right now.",false
57,Therapist,"Your doctor has mentioned that if your cholesterol remains high, you're at risk of stroke or heart attack in the future. Is that something you're aware of?",false
57,Client,"Yeah, but it's the potential side effect of muscle weakness that I'm more concerned about. That's what's on my mind right now.",false
57,Therapist,I understand your concern about the present moment and how this might affect your job. Can you help me understand what would need to happen for you to feel comfortable taking this medication?,false
57,Client,"Well, I guess if I could just take it home and think about it... But like I said, my main worry is how it will impact my job.",false
57,Therapist,"It sounds like you're weighing the potential risks and benefits. If you do experience muscle weakness, your doctor can adjust or switch your medication. Would that make a difference for you?",false
57,Client,"Sure, fine. Whatever.",false
57,Therapist,"Just to clarify, if you do decide to take the medication and experience any side effects, please don't hesitate to reach out to your doctor. They're there to support you.",false
57,Client,"Okay, sure. Fine.",false
57,Therapist,"Remember, taking care of your cholesterol levels is an important step in reducing your risk of stroke or heart attack. I encourage you to pick up your medication on your way out and take it as directed.",false
63,Therapist,"Tom, I understand that this infection has been quite painful for you. Fortunately, we have antibiotics that can help clear it up within 10 days if taken as directed. Are you willing to commit to taking the medication faithfully?",false
63,Client,Definitely.,false
63,Therapist,May I also discuss with you a screening form you completed earlier regarding substance use? Is that okay with you?,false
63,Client,Okay.,false
63,Therapist,Let's take a look at your responses. It appears that you occasionally use substances for non-medical purposes. Can you tell me more about the specific substances you've used?,false
63,Client,I do some meth.,false
63,Therapist,How do you typically consume it - snorting or smoking?,false
63,Client,"Snort it, always snort it.",false
63,Therapist,And you don't inject it?,false
63,Client,No.,false
63,Therapist,Do you use any other substances besides meth and alcohol?,false
63,Client,"Just, you know, some alcohol.",false
63,Therapist,Can you estimate how often you use meth - is it a regular occurrence or more sporadic?,false
63,Client,"Um, two, three times a month.",false
63,Therapist,"So, it sounds like you're an occasional user of meth. You don't use it frequently?",false
63,Client,Right.,false
63,Therapist,Only snorting it?,false
63,Client,Right.,false
63,Therapist,"As we discussed earlier, methamphetamine use carries significant health risks. Given your usage pattern, I'd categorize you as a risky user. This contrasts with someone who is addicted or a heavy user. One potential consequence of meth use is an increased risk of sexually transmitted diseases. Do you think there might be a connection between your meth use and the STD you're currently experiencing?",false
63,Client,"Yeah, it could be because I was high when I had unprotected sex, which isn't something I'd normally do.",false
63,Therapist,"So, typically, you're very careful about protection during sex?",false
63,Client,"Definitely, yeah.",false
63,Therapist,It seems that methamphetamine might have impaired your judgment in this instance?,false
63,Client,Yeah.,false
63,Therapist,Are there any other areas of your life where methamphetamine use is having an impact?,false
63,Client,"No, I mean, no. Like I said, I only do it in clubs with friends, two or three times a month at most. I don't think it's affecting me much otherwise. But this STD has really concerned me.",false
63,Therapist,"I share your concern, and my recommendation would be to stop using methamphetamine altogether. There are several reasons for this, but that's the course of action I'd advise.",false
63,Client,"I understand, but quitting seems like a tough thing to do. It's tied to my social life - all my friends use it in clubs, which is where I see them and have sex. Meth is just part of that scene, so it's hard to imagine stopping right away.",false
63,Therapist,"So, you recognize the potential problems associated with methamphetamine, but at the same time, it's deeply ingrained in your social life and relationships. Quitting would be challenging for you?",false
63,Client,"Yeah, I don't think it would be easy, but I'm willing to try.",false
63,Therapist,"If you were to consider how ready you are to stop using methamphetamine completely - on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being not ready at all and 10 being fully committed - where would you place yourself?",false
63,Client,"Uh, three.",false
63,Therapist,What makes it a three rather than a one or two?,false
63,Client,"Well, this experience with gonorrhea has been really uncomfortable. I know I don't think clearly when I'm on meth, and the risk of getting AIDS or HIV is scary. That's why my readiness to quit is higher than a one or two.",false
63,Therapist,Are there any other concerns you have about your methamphetamine use?,false
63,Client,"Yeah, since I only snort it, I worry about what it might be cut with - something that could be really bad for me.",false
63,Therapist,"Initially, I thought you might not be very interested in quitting methamphetamine, but now it seems like you have several reasons to want to stop. These include concerns about the substance being cut with unknown ingredients and the risk of contracting other STDs, including HIV.",false
63,Client,Yeah.,false
63,Therapist,What do you think would make it easier for you to reduce or quit using methamphetamine?,false
63,Client,Having something else to do on weekends - a different social life.,false
63,Therapist,How could you go about developing a new social life that doesn't involve methamphetamine use?,false
63,Client,That's the hard part - almost everyone I know uses it.,false
63,Therapist,Is there anyone in your life who doesn't use methamphetamine?,false
63,Client,My sister.,false
63,Therapist,"Have you talked to her about your meth use, or do you think she might be aware of it?",false
63,Client,"I haven't really discussed it with her, but we're close, and I think she knows. I could talk to her about it, and I'm sure she'd help.",false
63,Therapist,"So, on one hand, quitting methamphetamine would be difficult due to its ties to your social life, but on the other hand, you have reasons to want to quit and potential support systems in place, like talking to your sister.",false
63,Client,Yes.,false
63,Therapist,"And there are things you could do to make it easier to not use methamphetamine, such as seeking support from your sister.",false
63,Client,Yes.,false
63,Therapist,"Well, I recommend that you stop using methamphetamine altogether, but ultimately, the decision is yours. Would you be open to meeting again in a month to discuss your progress?",false
63,Client,"Yeah, sure.",false
69,Therapist,"Hi, Dr. Martin. I understand you had a question for me. Can you share what's on your mind?",false
69,Client,"I apologize, but could you clarify if you're the pharmacist? I have a specific inquiry about citalopram.",false
69,Therapist,"Yes, I'm the pharmacist on duty today. Citalopram is an antidepressant medication available in 10, 20, and 40-milligram strengths. It's primarily excreted through urine with a half-life of approximately 35 hours. Common side effects include those related to sexual function, cardiovascular health, and gastrointestinal issues.",false
69,Client,"I appreciate the information, but my primary concern is whether citalopram interacts with phenelzine?",false
69,Therapist,Let me check on that for you. (pause) It appears there shouldn't be any significant interactions between the two medications.,false
69,Client,"Thank you for clarifying that. I have another appointment I need to attend to, so I'll let you go.",false
69,Therapist,"You're welcome, Dr. Martin. Feel free to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns.",false
72,Therapist,"Chris, I wanted to touch base with you about our school's zero-tolerance policy for drugs and alcohol. As athletic director, it's my responsibility to ensure all student-athletes are aware of and adhering to this rule. I've heard some concerns from other students about a recent party, and I'd like to discuss whether or not you were involved.",false
72,Client,"Actually, I wanted to talk to you about what happened over the weekend. Normally, I'm an honor student who studies on weekends, but my friends were pressuring me to attend this party, so I convinced my parents to let me go. When I got there, I felt overwhelmed by the party environment and pressure to conform.",false
72,Therapist,I understand that it can be tough to navigate situations like that. Can you tell me more about what happened when you felt pressured?,false
72,Client,"Well, everyone was drinking and playing games with alcohol, just to get drunk for no reason. I didn't want to stand out or be ostracized, so I went along with it.",false
72,Therapist,"It sounds like you were trying to fit in. As someone who's been in high school before, I can understand the temptation. However, as a member of our team, we have rules in place for a reason.",false
72,Client,"I know that drinking is bad for me, my body, and my performance on the team. But I feel like my friends pressure me to drink, and I'm not sure how to handle it.",false
72,Therapist,"It can be tough to resist peer pressure, especially when you're part of a close-knit group like a sports team. Can you think of ways you might be able to navigate these situations differently in the future?",false
72,Client,"I guess I could try to lead by example and not drink, but I'm worried that my teammates will ridicule me for being too uptight.",false
72,Therapist,"As one of our star players, you have a unique opportunity to set a positive tone for your team. What do you think would happen if you took the lead in promoting healthy choices?",false
72,Client,I don't know...I feel like it's hard to go against the crowd.,false
72,Therapist,"I understand that it can be challenging, but as someone who cares about your well-being and success on our team, I want to encourage you to think about what's best for you. Can we make a plan to help you avoid situations where you might feel pressured to drink?",false
72,Client,Yeah...I'll try to dedicate my time to more positive activities and avoid parties where I might feel pressured to drink.,false
72,Therapist,That sounds like a great start. What specific steps can you take to ensure that you're not putting yourself in situations where you might be tempted to drink?,false
72,Client,"Well, I'll avoid going to parties where I know there will be drinking, and I won't post anything on social media that could get me in trouble.",false
72,Therapist,"That's a good plan. Let's make a deal: if you're going to be on the team, we need to agree that you'll follow our rules and avoid situations that might put you at risk.",false
72,Client,Okay...I promise I'll stop drinking and avoid those situations.,false
72,Therapist,"Alright, let's shake on it.",false
72,Client,Shake.,false
72,Therapist,"See you later, Chris.",false
72,Client,See you later.,false
66,Therapist,"Hello, Mr. Stowe. I'm Bruce Berger, your case manager with the health plan.",false
66,Client,Hi.,false
66,Therapist,How are you feeling today? You've recently received some news about your diabetes that we can discuss.,false
66,Client,"Yeah, I just found out I have diabetes and it sounds pretty serious. The doctor said my blood sugar is really high and there could be some major consequences if I don't take care of it.",false
66,Therapist,It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed by the diagnosis and the potential complications that come with it.,false
66,Client,"Yeah, she mentioned problems with my legs and...",false
66,Therapist,And now you're worried about all these possible issues. You seem scared and unsure about how to manage your diabetes.,false
66,Client,"It's not just fear; I don't want those things to happen to me. But when the doctor listed everything I need to do, it felt like too much to handle.",false
66,Therapist,"So, you're feeling discouraged by the amount of work required to manage your diabetes and worried that you might not be able to do it all.",false
66,Client,"Yeah, it's discouraging. It feels like a massive task that I'm not sure I can handle, and if I don't, all these terrible things will happen.",false
66,Therapist,"Let's break this down into smaller, more manageable steps so we can focus on getting your blood sugar under control. Your doctor is right; your blood sugar is high, but we can take it one step at a time to avoid feeling overwhelmed.",false
66,Client,"Yeah, I think that would help.",false
66,Therapist,"There are three main areas to focus on with diabetes management: taking medication as prescribed, changing eating habits, and increasing physical activity. Which of these feels most achievable for you right now?",false
66,Client,"Taking my medicine doesn't seem like a problem, especially since I know my blood sugar is high.",false
66,Therapist,That's a great place to start. Taking your medication once a day from the prescription seems doable.,false
66,Client,"Yeah, I'm pretty good at taking my meds.",false
66,Therapist,"Changing eating habits and increasing physical activity are also important, but we can work on those over time. Monitoring your blood sugar will help you see how these changes affect your health.",false
66,Client,"Oh, okay. That makes sense now.",false
66,Therapist,How do you feel about our plan so far? Does breaking it down into smaller steps make it feel more manageable?,false
66,Client,"Yeah, I like that we can take it one step at a time. It relieves some pressure.",false
66,Therapist,You seem committed to taking your medication and making progress.,false
66,Client,"Yeah, as long as there aren't any major side effects, I think I can do it.",false
78,Therapist,"Hi, I'm Bruce Berger. I work in the clinic and noticed you're here to pick up a prescription for Sarah's rescue inhaler for her asthma.",false
78,Client,Mm-hmm. Yeah.,false
78,Therapist,I see that she's been in the emergency room five times in the last year for her asthma. Can you tell me what that experience has been like for you?,false
78,Client,"It's been really difficult. I hate to see her gasping for breath, and I'm worried when she has to go.",false
78,Therapist,That sounds incredibly challenging. You'd do anything to prevent those situations from happening.,false
78,Client,Mm-hmm. Yeah.,false
78,Therapist,I also noticed it's been about three months since you picked up the prescription for her chronic inhaler. Are there any difficulties that have come up with that?,false
78,Client,"Well, I did some research on the chronic inhaler and found out it contains steroids, which I don't want her taking due to potential side effects.",false
78,Therapist,It sounds like you're very concerned about Sarah's health and want to protect her from any harm.,false
78,Client,Mm-hmm. Yeah.,false
78,Therapist,You mentioned you smoke but make sure not to do so around her. Can we talk a bit more about the chronic inhaler and your concerns about steroids?,false
78,Client,Yeah.,false
78,Therapist,"Even though this medicine is in the same broad family as anabolic steroids, it's actually very different. Let me explain.",false
78,Client,Okay.,false
78,Therapist,"If I can draw an analogy, a grape and a watermelon are both fruits, but they're quite different. This medicine is like a small grape, not a large watermelon. It reduces inflammation in her lungs without getting absorbed into the body.",false
78,Client,"Oh, okay.",false
78,Therapist,What are your thoughts about considering having Sarah use this medication now that you understand it better?,false
78,Client,"Well, I guess I didn't realize they weren't the same thing as anabolic steroids.",false
78,Therapist,"You were concerned because of the name corticosteroid. But I assure you, this is a safe medication for her lungs.",false
78,Client,Okay.,false
78,Therapist,Can I explain what happens to Sarah's lungs when she has these inflammations and needs to go to the emergency room?,false
78,Client,Yeah.,false
78,Therapist,"Her lungs are extremely sensitive, like burned skin. This chronic inhaler can reduce that inflammation so her lungs aren't as reactive.",false
78,Client,"Oh, okay.",false
78,Therapist,"Unfortunately, even though you smoke outside, the smoke on your clothes can still affect her lungs. If she uses the chronic inhaler daily, it may help reduce her sensitivity to the smoke.",false
78,Client,Even when it's just on my clothes?,false
78,Therapist,"Yes, that's correct. You'll need to keep an eye on how she reacts when you're around her with smoke on your clothes.",false
78,Client,"Right. Um, so would it help if I only smoked while she was at school and changed my clothes before she came home?",false
78,Therapist,That sounds like a great idea. Not smoking in the house is also important.,false
78,Client,"Oh, absolutely. I never do that.",false
78,Therapist,"If you're willing to make those changes, that would certainly help. And if you decide to quit smoking in the future, we'd be happy to support you.",false
78,Client,Yeah.,false
78,Therapist,So it sounds like we have a plan for Sarah to use the chronic inhaler and for you to reduce her exposure to smoke on your clothes.,false
78,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
78,Therapist,"We'll get both prescriptions ready. Use the chronic inhaler every day, keep the rescue inhaler around if needed, and let's see how that works.",false
78,Client,Okay.,false
78,Therapist,Alright. Good.,false
78,Client,That sounds good. Thank you.,false
81,Therapist,Can you help me understand your experiences with your parents' parenting style?,false
81,Client,(no change),false
81,Therapist,How have you been feeling lately? Is there anything on your mind that's been bothering you?,false
81,Client,"I've noticed some changes in my body, and it's making me feel a bit bigger.",false
81,Therapist,That sounds like a significant adjustment. Can you tell me more about what that's like for you?,false
81,Client,"To be honest, it feels kind of scary.",false
81,Therapist,It takes courage to acknowledge those feelings. You're feeling uncomfortable with the changes in your body - is that right?,false
81,Client,(no change),false
81,Therapist,I sense there might be something specific on your mind related to this topic. Can you help me understand what's not quite clear to you yet?,false
81,Client,"I know there's something going on inside, but I don't have all the information about it.",false
81,Therapist,You're aware that we've discussed the importance of a medical check-up. What's holding you back from scheduling an appointment so far?,false
81,Client,"I know you think I should see the doctor, but I haven't made the call yet.",false
81,Therapist,Can you help me understand what's making it difficult for you to take this step?,false
81,Client,"Honestly, it all feels a bit too much to handle right now.",false
81,Therapist,What specifically about the process is feeling overwhelming to you?,false
81,Client,"Well, I'm not a fan of making phone calls, and then there's all the paperwork. Plus, getting there will be a challenge, and I really dislike needles.",false
81,Therapist,It sounds like your concerns are multifaceted - ranging from logistical challenges to personal discomfort with medical appointments. Is that a fair summary?,false
81,Client,(no change),false
81,Therapist,How can I best support you in addressing these concerns and making progress on scheduling the appointment?,false
81,Client,Would it be possible for you to help me make the call?,false
81,Therapist,"Of course, we can work through that together.",false
81,Client,Would you also be able to accompany me to the appointment?,false
81,Therapist,"I'll do my best to arrange that, although my schedule might not permit it. Let's brainstorm some alternative solutions to ensure you have support and feel more at ease during the appointment.",false
90,Therapist,"Tommy, I wanted to discuss some concerns I have after seeing pictures of you and your friends at a party on Facebook. As someone who cares about you, it's worrying to see you drinking underage.",false
90,Client,"It was just a social gathering, and the drinks were available. My friends were all doing it, so I decided to join in and let loose for a bit.",false
90,Therapist,"I understand that it might seem like fun, but there are serious consequences associated with underage drinking. You could face arrest, accidents, or negatively impact your schoolwork. Your future is bright, and I want to make sure you're making choices that support it.",false
90,Client,"I get where you're coming from, and I thought I had things under control. I didn't want to lose myself in the moment, so I made sure to keep an eye on my drinking and ensure my friends were okay.",false
90,Therapist,"It's great that you're thinking about your limits, but it's essential to consider the risks of underage drinking. Can you help me understand what you mean by ""not drinking too much""?",false
90,Client,"Yeah, I understand exactly what you're saying. And—",false
90,Therapist,How often do you find yourself in situations where you're drinking?,false
90,Client,"It's mainly at social gatherings, like parties. I don't drink alone or make it a regular habit.",false
90,Therapist,"Is this something that happens frequently, like every weekend?",false
90,Client,More like every other weekend.,false
90,Therapist,"Tommy, I'm concerned about the potential impact on your life. Can you think of alternative ways to have fun and socialize that don't involve drinking?",false
90,Client,"Um, I guess I can be more productive with my schoolwork and find other activities instead of going to parties as much. I understand where you're coming from.",false
90,Therapist,Are there any friends or influences in your life that might be contributing to your decision to drink?,false
90,Client,"Yeah, I guess it's been easier to follow my friends' lead and do what seems fun at the time. I want to make the most of my high school experience.",false
90,Therapist,"It's natural to want to have fun, but some choices can have long-term consequences. Let's talk about making decisions that align with your values and goals.",false
90,Client,"Mm. Yeah. I see how reducing my drinking could positively impact my life. It makes sense, and I'm willing to put in effort to make a change.",false
90,Therapist,"I think it would be beneficial for you to consider quitting altogether. However, if cutting down is a more realistic goal for now, that's still a step in the right direction.",false
90,Client,"Yeah. I mean, alcohol is everywhere, and I feel like I should understand its effects before making any drastic changes. I don't see it as something that will ruin my life.",false
90,Therapist,"I'm worried about the potential risks, but I appreciate your willingness to discuss this with me. Let's work together to find a plan that helps you gain control over your drinking habits.",false
90,Client,"Yeah. I-I don't want to wait for something traumatic to happen before making a change. I can imagine how things could escalate, and I'd rather take control now.",false
90,Therapist,That's a great attitude to have. Let's work together to create a plan that supports your goals and helps you make positive choices.,false
90,Client,Yeah. I think that would be a good step forward towards a life of sobriety and experiencing the world without the influence of alcohol.,false
90,Therapist,"Okay, sounds good.",false
90,Client,Okay.,false
87,Therapist,"Before we begin, I'd like to explain how our conversation will unfold. We'll discuss your responses to the questionnaires you completed last week, and then explore any topics that interest you.",false
87,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
87,Therapist,"I want to make sure we cover everything that's on your mind, so feel free to start wherever you'd like.",false
87,Client,"Yeah, well... when I was filling out those questionnaires, it was weird because I don't usually think about my drinking as a big deal. I guess I never really consider how much I drink.",false
87,Therapist,You're saying that reflecting on your drinking habits wasn't something you normally did?,false
87,Client,"No, not really. And when I had to write down how much I drink every day, it was eye-opening – the amount added up quickly.",false
87,Therapist,It sounds like seeing your drinking patterns in black and white was surprising for you.,false
87,Client,"Yeah, because I thought I drank about as much as my friends do. But then I talked to my roommate about it, and she was shocked by how much I drink on weekends – Thursday through Sunday.",false
87,Therapist,Your roommate's reaction made you realize that your drinking habits might be more excessive than you initially thought?,false
87,Client,"Yeah... I mean, I didn't know my friends weren't aware of how much I was drinking. It just seemed normal to me, but now I'm not so sure.",false
87,Therapist,"This new information has given you a different perspective on your drinking, and it's clear that your roommate's reaction had an impact on you.",false
87,Client,"Yeah... I thought everyone was doing the same thing, but apparently not.",false
87,Therapist,It seems like this experience has made you more aware of how your drinking habits compare to others?,false
87,Client,Yeah.,false
87,Therapist,That's a significant realization. Can you tell me more about what stood out to you when filling out those questionnaires?,false
87,Client,"Just that it was weird to see my drinking patterns in writing, I guess.",false
96,Therapist,"Welcome, Katie. I'm looking forward to getting to know you better today. Can you start by sharing a bit about yourself and what brings you here?",false
96,Client,"Yeah, sure. My doctor referred me because he's concerned about my pregnancy and baby. So, I'm just doing what I'm told.",false
96,Therapist,It sounds like your doctor has some concerns that led him to recommend our meeting today. Can you tell me more about those concerns?,false
96,Client,He's worried about my drinking habits.,false
96,Therapist,I see. And how do you feel about his concerns regarding your alcohol intake?,false
96,Client,"Honestly, no concerns at all.",false
96,Therapist,You don't share the same level of concern as your doctor. Can you help me understand more about your perspective on this issue?,false
96,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
96,Therapist,I'd like to learn more about your relationship with alcohol and how it fits into your daily life. Would you be willing to share that with me?,false
96,Client,"Okay, sure. Well, I usually have a glass of wine with dinner every night, and sometimes when I'm out with friends. It's just something we've always done in my family.",false
96,Therapist,"So, drinking has been a part of your social culture and helps you unwind. Can you tell me more about that?",false
96,Client,"Yeah, it's just something I enjoy doing to relax.",false
96,Therapist,"You mentioned having friends who have drunk during pregnancy without issues, and you've also read articles suggesting there's no clear link between drinking and abnormalities. How do those messages influence your thoughts on this topic?",false
96,Client,"It makes me think that maybe the concerns are overblown, and I should be able to make my own choices about what I drink.",false
96,Therapist,You feel like you're capable of making informed decisions about your body and your pregnancy. Can you tell me more about what drives that sense of independence?,false
96,Client,"Yeah, I just don't want someone telling me what I can or can't do.",false
96,Therapist,"It sounds like you value autonomy and self-determination. How does that relate to the information your doctor shared with you, and this brochure we're discussing?",false
96,Client,"Well, it feels like they're trying to control my choices and tell me what's best for me.",false
96,Therapist,You feel like there's a disconnect between the messages you've received from different sources. Can I show you some information about Canada's guidelines on drinking during pregnancy?,false
96,Client,"Yeah, sure.",false
96,Therapist,"According to these guidelines, there is no safe amount of alcohol to drink during pregnancy. What are your thoughts on that?",false
96,Client,I'm not convinced. I need to see more evidence before I believe it's a real risk.,false
96,Therapist,You're looking for concrete proof and a clear explanation of the risks associated with drinking during pregnancy. Can you tell me more about what would convince you of those risks?,false
96,Client,"Yeah, if someone could show me direct evidence or explain why it's so bad.",false
96,Therapist,"It sounds like you're seeking clarity on the ""why"" behind these guidelines. Let's put that question aside for now and explore your goals for this pregnancy. Was having a baby something you had planned for?",false
96,Client,"Yeah, we were trying to get pregnant.",false
96,Therapist,"Having a healthy baby is clearly important to you. What does being a good parent mean to you, and how do you plan to achieve that?",false
96,Client,"It means being there for my child, taking care of them, and providing a stable home environment.",false
96,Therapist,You want to create a nurturing and protective space for your child. How does that goal align with the information we've discussed today about drinking during pregnancy?,false
96,Client,"I guess it doesn't really add up. If I'm trying to protect my baby, why would I drink?",false
96,Therapist,It sounds like you're starting to see a connection between your goals as a parent and the potential risks associated with drinking during pregnancy. What do you think is the next step for you in terms of making changes?,false
96,Client,"Well, if I could take this brochure home and discuss it with my partner, that would be helpful.",false
96,Therapist,That's a great idea. Having your partner on board will likely make a big difference. Are you open to continuing our conversation at our next meeting and exploring ways to support you in making these changes?,false
96,Client,"Yeah, that sounds like a good plan.",false
93,Therapist,"As we consider our focus for today's session, I'd like to reflect on your interests in changing your physical activity, eating habits, and body confidence. Which of these areas resonates with you the most as a starting point?",false
93,Client,"I think increasing my physical activity is a more manageable goal initially, whereas changing my nutrition habits might be more challenging, but establishing an activity routine could set the stage for other positive changes.",false
93,Therapist,So it sounds like physical activity feels like a more accessible place to begin making changes.,false
93,Client,"Yes, that's correct.",false
93,Therapist,"Great. Can you tell me more about what motivates you to become more physically active? I recall you mentioning improved energy levels and mood, as well as reduced irritability and stress. Are there any other benefits that drive your desire for this change?",false
93,Client,"Yes, I'd like to feel physically stronger and more capable, which would be beneficial in everyday situations, such as opening jars. Additionally, I believe regular activity would enhance my body image and confidence, alongside the benefits of improved mood, productivity, and energy.",false
93,Therapist,"So you're seeking to increase your physical strength and capabilities, which would also positively impact your overall confidence and body image.",false
93,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
93,Therapist,"On a scale from 0 to 10, with 0 being not at all ready and 10 being highly motivated, how would you rate your readiness to make changes in your physical activity?",false
93,Client,I'd say around an 8.,false
93,Therapist,"Okay, so you're feeling quite motivated. What led you to choose an 8 rather than a lower rating, such as a 6?",false
93,Client,"Well, considering the various benefits of regular activity, including improved mood and energy, I'm eager to experience these positive changes and feel better about myself.",false
93,Therapist,"It sounds like the numerous advantages of physical activity are driving your motivation. Let's recap – you've mentioned energy, mood, strength, and body confidence as key benefits.",false
93,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
93,Therapist,Is there anything else that's important to you in this context?,false
93,Client,"No, I don't think so.",false
93,Therapist,"Alright, those are the core aspects for you. Now, if you're interested, we can explore what increasing your physical activity might look like and which activities you might enjoy.",false
93,Client,"Mm-hmm, yes.",false
93,Therapist,"Okay, let's discuss some possibilities.",false
93,Client,"Yeah, that'd be great.",false
99,Therapist,"Steve, before we conclude today's visit, I'd like to take a few minutes to discuss your drinking habits. Would you be open to exploring this topic?",false
99,Client,"Okay, what specifically would you like to know?",false
99,Therapist,"You completed a survey for us earlier, which was helpful. I noticed that you reported drinking two to three times a week, with three or four drinks per occasion, and sometimes exceeding six drinks in one sitting. Does that sound accurate to you?",false
99,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
99,Therapist,"Can you confirm if this pattern is typical for you, perhaps on weekends?",false
99,Client,"Yeah, uh, on the weekends?",false
99,Therapist,"I want to express my concern about your drinking level, as excessive consumption can exacerbate problems or lead to health issues. Have you considered a possible connection between your drinking and symptoms like anxiety and insomnia that brought you here today?",false
99,Client,"No, I guess I haven't really thought much of it. Um, you know, I don't really think I drink that much in the first place-",false
99,Therapist,Mm-hmm.,false
99,Client,-so I have a hard time believing that it's causing my anxiety.,false
99,Therapist,"You're not alone in thinking that drinking helps with sleep. However, research suggests that while alcohol might facilitate falling asleep faster, it can also disrupt sleep patterns later on. Have you experienced anything like this?",false
99,Client,"Well, I, yeah, I guess I do have about 2:00 AM, I tend to wake up on the nights I drink too much.",false
99,Therapist,"Let me show you a chart that provides some context for your drinking habits. As a male in your age group, low-risk drinking is defined as no more than 14 drinks per week and four drinks per day. Your current consumption falls into the high-risk category. Would you like to take a closer look?",false
99,Client,"Jeez, no. I didn't think I was that bad.",false
99,Therapist,"It's essential to consider this information and gain perspective. On a scale of 1-10, how ready are you to make changes to your drinking habits, with 1 being not at all willing and 10 being very willing?",false
99,Client,"I don't know. I mean, this is all news to me. I've always thought of myself as a pretty healthy guy. I guess I'd put myself right in the middle, around five.",false
99,Therapist,"That's a good starting point. What kept you from rating yourself lower, say 1 or 2?",false
99,Client,"Well, you know I'm training for the marathon, and that's why I'm coming in – to get my sleep back on track. But I also don't think of myself as a hazardous drinker or an alcoholic.",false
99,Therapist,"Mm-hmm. Okay. So, it sounds like your health is important to you, especially with the marathon approaching. You're also surprised by your classification as a high-risk drinker.",false
99,Client,Yes.,false
99,Therapist,"Based on this new information, what are you willing to consider changing about your drinking habits?",false
99,Client,"Well, I-I think the natural thing would be to cut back a little on my drinking.",false
99,Therapist,What specific changes do you envision making?,false
99,Client,"Mm, um, you know, I-I guess drinking no more than maybe three or four times a week, and-and on the weekends, which is when I would drink the most, cutting back to no more than five or six beers.",false
99,Therapist,"Writing down your goals can be helpful. If you were to set a specific target for reducing your drinking, what would it look like?",false
99,Client,"Um, doing the math, I guess no more than 18 drinks a week.",false
99,Therapist,"That's an improvement, but keep in mind that this still exceeds the low-risk category. My recommendation is to aim for 14 or fewer drinks per week. Nevertheless, your willingness to make changes is commendable.",false
99,Client,Thanks.,false
99,Therapist,Let's touch base on this progress during our next appointment and see how things are going.,false
99,Client,Sure.,false
99,Therapist,Okay. Good.,false
102,Therapist,"Hi, Liz. I appreciate you taking the time to meet with me today.",false
102,Client,Sure.,false
102,Therapist,What's been on your mind lately that you'd like to work towards or change?,false
102,Client,"Well, [sighs] I've been thinking about working out lately. I really want to start exercising again. It's been weighing on my mind, and I know I need to do it. The challenge is finding the motivation to get started.",false
102,Therapist,"You've mentioned this goal before, and it seems like something that's important to you. Can you tell me more about what's holding you back from taking action?",false
102,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
102,Therapist,It sounds like you're aware of the importance of making progress on this goal. What do you think is needed for you to move forward with exercising regularly?,false
102,Client,"Well, I don't know if I'm really being lazy about it. I think it's just that I have a busy schedule.",false
102,Therapist,That makes sense. It can be tough to prioritize exercise when life gets busy.,false
102,Client,"I just need to find the time to do it. And, yes, I might be lacking a little bit of motivation, but I think it's more about timing and trying to fit it in.",false
102,Therapist,You're recognizing that finding time is a challenge for you. Can you tell me more about what you think would help you overcome this obstacle?,false
102,Client,"And that sounds like a lot of excuses to me isn't really fair - I do have a gym membership, but I'm struggling to find the time to use it.",false
102,Therapist,Having a gym membership is a great resource. What do you think would be a realistic goal for using it regularly?,false
102,Client,"But I think that part of the problem is that I-I don't have three to four times- three to four times a week to do it, or an hour even. I mean, hour is a long time because if I'm working out for an hour that means I'm leaving home to get there-",false
102,Therapist,You're considering the bigger picture and how exercise fits into your daily routine.,false
102,Client,"-time there, time back. I mean, it's not just an hour, it's like two hours, realistically.",false
102,Therapist,It sounds like you're thinking about the logistics of exercising regularly. What do you think would make it more manageable for you?,false
102,Client,"Well, oh, um, okay.",false
102,Therapist,"Before we wrap up today, is there anything that you'd like to commit to trying before our next session?",false
102,Client,Okay.,false
102,Therapist,I'm looking forward to hearing about your progress tomorrow.,false
105,Therapist,Can you tell me more about your experience with exercise since our last conversation?,false
105,Client,"I've actually been to the gym a couple of times, which is progress for me.",false
105,Therapist,That's great to hear. You're taking steps towards your goal.,false
105,Client,"Yeah, and it feels good because my pants are fitting better too.",false
105,Therapist,What else have you noticed besides the improvement in how your clothes fit?,false
105,Client,I do feel better overall.,false
105,Therapist,Can you elaborate on that feeling?,false
105,Client,My back doesn't hurt as much as it used to.,false
105,Therapist,That's a significant change. How does it feel to experience less pain?,false
105,Client,"It's a relief, but at the same time, it's still challenging for me to maintain a regular gym routine.",false
105,Therapist,What do you think would help you build up your endurance and spend more time at the gym?,false
105,Client,I guess just sticking with it and not getting sidetracked by other things.,false
105,Therapist,You're acknowledging that consistency is key. Can you tell me more about what happened last week when you didn't make it to the gym until Thursday?,false
105,Client,"It was a frustrating week because I was busy with other things, but I did manage to go on Saturday too.",false
105,Therapist,"So even though it wasn't a perfect week, you still made an effort to get to the gym. That's something to acknowledge.",false
105,Client,"Yeah, and it's been tough lately with my schedule being hectic.",false
105,Therapist,"It sounds like you're facing some challenges, but you're also making progress. What's going through your mind when you see younger guys at the gym who can lift more weight or stay on the treadmill longer?",false
105,Client,"To be honest, it's a bit discouraging because I feel like I'm not as capable as they are.",false
105,Therapist,It sounds like you're comparing yourself to others. What do you think is driving that desire to compare?,false
105,Client,"When I'm at the gym, I sometimes get caught up in wanting to be more like those guys, but when I'm outside of that environment, I realize it's not a realistic or desirable goal for me.",false
105,Therapist,"So, what is motivating you right now? Is it just about feeling good because your pants fit better?",false
105,Client,"Yeah, that's definitely part of it. It makes me feel more confident and positive about myself.",false
105,Therapist,What other benefits have you noticed since starting to exercise regularly?,false
105,Client,"I've made some small changes to my diet, like eating less junk food.",false
105,Therapist,That's a great start. Can you tell me more about what's driving those healthier choices?,false
105,Client,"When I'm tempted by unhealthy foods, I take a moment to think twice before giving in.",false
105,Therapist,You're developing self-awareness and making more intentional decisions. What do you think would help you make even healthier choices?,false
105,Client,"If I start seeing more significant results from my workouts, like losing weight or noticing improvements in my overall health, that might motivate me to make better food choices.",false
105,Therapist,"So, it's about finding a balance between enjoying life and making healthy decisions. You're recognizing that the payoff of unhealthy foods isn't worth the trade-off.",false
105,Client,Exactly. It's not worth undoing all my hard work at the gym.,false
105,Therapist,That's a great perspective to have. It sounds like you're making progress and feeling more positive about your journey so far.,false
105,Client,"Yeah, I'm pretty pleased with how things are going. Our last conversation was really helpful in getting me started again.",false
108,Therapist,"I appreciate you taking the time to meet with me today, and I understand from your counselor that you're managing a lot of responsibilities. Can you share more about what's been going on?",false
108,Client,"Well, I have a two-year-old son, work full-time as a server, and recently started night classes, so it all feels overwhelming.",false
108,Therapist,That sounds incredibly challenging. Are you also a single mom?,false
108,Client,Yes.,false
108,Therapist,"It's clear that you're facing multiple stressors right now. As a single mom working full-time and pursuing education, what do you think would be the most helpful for us to focus on today?",false
108,Client,I told my counselor that childcare is probably my biggest issue right now.,false
108,Therapist,Can you elaborate on your concerns about childcare?,false
108,Client,"Yeah...my mom usually watches my son, but lately, it's been a problem. She'll cancel at the last minute, and I've had to miss work or class. It's stressful not knowing if I can rely on her.",false
108,Therapist,"So, it sounds like the situation with your mom is unpredictable and causing you additional stress. You're missing out on important commitments because of it.",false
108,Client,Exactly.,false
108,Therapist,"Outside of your mom, is there anyone else who could potentially help with childcare?",false
108,Client,"I have a sister, but I don't trust her to watch my son. There's also a neighbor who helped once when my mom canceled; she has a three-year-old daughter, so it worked out okay.",false
108,Therapist,It sounds like this neighbor was supportive in your time of need.,false
108,Client,Yeah.,false
108,Therapist,"When you picked up your son after the neighbor watched him, did everything seem fine?",false
108,Client,Yeah.,false
108,Therapist,Let's explore this neighbor as a potential resource. I know affordability can be a significant issue with childcare. Have you considered how you might afford to pay someone regularly to watch your son?,false
108,Client,"A little, but I don't make enough money to afford daycare or full-time babysitting.",false
108,Therapist,What are some of your natural skills that could potentially be used in exchange for childcare?,false
108,Client,I like cooking; I'm actually studying culinary arts.,false
108,Therapist,That's great! Would you consider working out an arrangement with this neighbor where you prepare dinner for her and her daughter in exchange for watching your son?,false
108,Client,"Hmm...that's interesting. I never thought of that, but it might work.",false
108,Therapist,"Okay. So, aside from this neighbor, is there anyone else who could help you with childcare?",false
108,Client,"No, there aren't many people I trust right now.",false
108,Therapist,That's completely understandable. You need to prioritize your son's well-being and follow your intuition on this.,false
108,Client,Yeah.,false
108,Therapist,What about the baby's father? Is he involved in any way?,false
108,Client,"[chuckles] No, not at all. He hasn't been in the picture since my son was born.",false
108,Therapist,"Okay. Well, it seems like we have a promising lead with the neighbor. If you pursue this option, you might find some relief and resolve your childcare issues. How many nights do you attend school?",false
108,Client,"Three nights – Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.",false
108,Therapist,"So, what would it look like if both your neighbor and mom were helping with childcare?",false
108,Client,"If my neighbor could take over one day, I think that would help my mom a lot.",false
108,Therapist,It sounds like reducing the burden on your mom might make her more supportive.,false
108,Client,Yeah.,false
108,Therapist,What do you see as your next steps in working out a plan between your neighbor and mom?,false
108,Client,"Talking to my neighbor about this idea, and if she's interested, discussing it with my mom to see if it can help her feel more reliable.",false
108,Therapist,"Okay. Sounds like you have a solid plan. Now, I understand your son is almost three years old. Have you considered enrolling him in Head Start when he turns three?",false
108,Client,"I've heard of it, but don't know much about the program.",false
108,Therapist,"Head Start is an affordable, high-quality preschool program designed for families like yours. It prepares children socially and intellectually for school. Would you like more information on local Head Start sites?",false
108,Client,"Yeah, that sounds great for my son, and it would definitely help me with childcare.",false
108,Therapist,I also noticed from the nurse practitioner's notes that you're working on reducing your smoking and drinking. How's that going?,false
108,Client,"[chuckles] It's been harder than expected, but some days I've met my goals for cigarettes and drinks.",false
108,Therapist,"So, it's a bigger challenge than you anticipated, but you're committed to making progress.",false
108,Client,Yeah.,false
108,Therapist,Have you considered the risks of secondhand smoke and how it might affect your son?,false
108,Client,"Yeah, I try not to smoke around him, and if I do smoke at home, I go out to the balcony.",false
108,Therapist,It's clear that you prioritize your son's well-being. Let's reflect on our discussion today. We've explored options for childcare with your neighbor and Head Start programs. What are your next steps?,false
108,Client,"Talking to my neighbor about this idea, and if she's interested, discussing it with my mom to see if it can help her feel more reliable.",false
108,Therapist,Okay. It sounds like you have a solid plan in place. Would you be open to meeting again in two weeks to review your progress and address any challenges that may arise?,false
108,Client,Okay.,false
108,Therapist,"Great! I appreciate your time today, Sarah. It was nice meeting you.",false
108,Client,Thanks.,false
114,Therapist,"Can you confirm the accuracy of the Minnesota State Mankato security report, and would you be willing to share some details about what led up to the incident?",false
114,Client,"Yeah, that sounds right. I was drinking at my friend's house while watching the game, and things got out of hand.",false
114,Therapist,"Just to make sure I understand, it seems like your disappointment with the Vikings' performance led you to drink more than intended, and when you couldn't find a ride home, you decided to drive yourself.",false
114,Client,Exactly. That's what happened. I'm just a normal college kid who likes to have fun with friends.,false
114,Therapist,"It sounds like you were trying to be responsible by finding a ride home, but things didn't work out that way. Can you help me understand why you think this incident occurred?",false
114,Client,"I guess I tried to be safe, but it didn't matter since I still got in trouble.",false
114,Therapist,"Dylan, what do you believe is the real issue here? Is it related to your drinking habits or something else?",false
114,Client,"Honestly, I think I have a problem with getting caught. My friends drink just as much as I do, but they never get in trouble.",false
114,Therapist,"It seems like you attribute this situation to bad luck rather than any personal responsibility. If that's the case, what consequences might you face if you don't make any changes?",false
114,Client,"Probably more problems with the police and school, which would be really tough for me financially and time-wise.",false
114,Therapist,How important is it for you to avoid future problems with the authorities or your school?,false
114,Client,"It's extremely important. The experience of going to detox was awful, and I don't want to repeat that. Plus, my dad said if I get suspended, I'll have to work on his farm in Iowa, which would ruin my social life.",false
114,Therapist,What are you willing to do to prevent similar situations from happening again?,false
114,Client,I guess the easiest thing is to drink less and avoid situations where I might get in trouble. That's probably a good starting point.,false
114,Therapist,"On a scale of 1 to 10, how confident are you that you can stick to this plan?",false
114,Client,Maybe around a six? I'm not super confident yet.,false
114,Therapist,What steps could you take to increase your confidence and move from a six to a seven or eight?,false
114,Client,"Well, maybe if I only drink at my apartment, I'll avoid driving risks. Or if I go out, I can wait until I'm 21 to drink. Maybe there are other things to do in this town that don't involve drinking.",false
114,Therapist,How might your life improve if you're successful in making these changes?,false
114,Client,"I think I'd be more focused on my studies and make it to my early morning classes without being hungover. That would really help me succeed, like I did in high school with a 3.5 GPA.",false
114,Therapist,"What values or beliefs drive your decision-making, especially when it comes to drinking?",false
114,Client,"Education is crucial for me and my family. I want to be an international journalist, so if I prioritize what's important, I won't disappoint my parents and can get a good education.",false
114,Therapist,"Thanks for participating today. As part of your sanction, you'll need to attend an alcohol education seminar that costs $150.",false
114,Client,"Alright, when is the seminar?",false
111,Therapist,"Hi Katie, I'm Beth, a nurse who works with Mrs. Smith. May I take a moment to talk with you?",false
111,Client,Yeah.,false
111,Therapist,"While you were waiting for your appointment, you completed a healthy habits questionnaire that included some questions about marijuana use. Would you be open to discussing how it affects your life?",false
111,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
111,Therapist,I noticed you reported using marijuana regularly. Can you help me understand its role in your life and how it helps you?,false
111,Client,"Well, now that it's decriminalized in Virginia, it's not a big deal. Am I in trouble?",false
111,Therapist,Not at all. I'm here to support you. You mentioned it helps you relax. Can you tell me more about how you use it for relaxation?,false
111,Client,It's just something I do a couple times a week to unwind.,false
111,Therapist,"So, marijuana is a way for you to manage stress and anxiety in your life?",false
111,Client,"Yeah. With my academic scholarship and debate team commitments, there's a lot on my plate.",false
111,Therapist,"That sounds incredibly challenging. As the first person in your family to attend college, it can be overwhelming. How do you think marijuana helps with that pressure?",false
111,Client,"Honestly, I've always been an anxious person, and pot just calms my nerves.",false
111,Therapist,"You're not in trouble, Katie. I'm here to help. What are some positive aspects of using marijuana for you, besides relaxation?",false
111,Client,"When I use it with friends, I feel like I fit in more.",false
111,Therapist,"So, using marijuana in social situations helps you feel more connected to your peers?",false
111,Client,"I guess so, but I don't know if I really feel accepted; I just try to fit in by using it.",false
111,Therapist,It sounds like using marijuana with friends doesn't necessarily make you feel more comfortable or accepted. Can you think of any downsides to smoking pot?,false
111,Client,"Well, my parents would kill me if they knew, and I'm worried about getting caught.",false
111,Therapist,"So, marijuana use causes stress due to concerns about your family's reaction and potential consequences?",false
111,Client,Yeah.,false
111,Therapist,Are there any other negative aspects of using marijuana that come to mind?,false
111,Client,"It's expensive, and I usually have to ask my roommate for it, which is embarrassing.",false
111,Therapist,"So, smoking pot also reminds you of your financial struggles and creates feelings of embarrassment?",false
111,Client,Yeah.,false
111,Therapist,"Katie, it seems like marijuana use has both positive and negative effects on your life. Considering these points, what do you think you'd like to do about your marijuana use?",false
111,Client,"I don't know... when you put it that way, it doesn't seem like a great habit.",false
111,Therapist,Would you be open to a suggestion?,false
111,Client,Okay.,false
111,Therapist,You mentioned struggling with anxiety. Have you ever considered talking to a counselor about it?,false
111,Client,"No, we don't do that in my family.",false
111,Therapist,Can you tell me more about why counseling isn't an option for your family?,false
111,Client,"It's just not something we do; it's seen as only for people who are ""crazy,"" and we can't afford it.",false
111,Therapist,"I understand. However, our college offers free counseling services that have been very helpful to many students dealing with anxiety. Would you be interested in learning more?",false
111,Client,I don't know...,false
111,Therapist,What's holding you back from considering counseling?,false
111,Client,"I don't think my parents would approve, and I'm worried about the cost.",false
111,Therapist,"Our services are free, and we prioritize your confidentiality. We can discuss the specifics of our privacy policy if you're interested in seeking help.",false
111,Client,Okay... I'll think about it.,false
111,Therapist,"If you'd like, I can show you where our counseling center is located and introduce you to one of our counselors?",false
111,Client,Do I have to go there?,false
111,Therapist,Not at all. I just want to make sure you're aware of the resources available to you on campus.,false
111,Client,"Okay, sure. Let's go.",false
120,Therapist,"I'm glad we were able to clarify things, and I think you'll start feeling better soon. How does that sound?",false
120,Client,"Thanks so much, doctor. I'll just take it easy for a couple of days.",false
120,Therapist,"Since we have some time left, I'd like to explore another topic with you. I've noticed your blood pressure and weight have been increasing over the past few years. Would you be open to discussing this further?",false
120,Client,"Yeah, I suppose. I know my weight is a problem, but every time I try to lose it, I end up gaining it back.",false
120,Therapist,It can be really tough to manage weight. Maybe we can work together to find some strategies that might help.,false
120,Client,"Okay, thank you doctor, but I'm worried about how I can possibly lose weight with my busy schedule and family commitments.",false
120,Therapist,"That's completely understandable. We don't need to figure everything out today. Let's focus on finding one small step that fits into your life, and we can build from there.",false
120,Client,"Okay, that sounds great. So, what should I do?",false
120,Therapist,One aspect of managing weight is regular physical activity. It has many benefits for our overall health. Can you think of ways to incorporate more activity into your daily routine?,false
120,Client,"I knew you were going to say that, but I don't have time in my schedule for the gym.",false
120,Therapist,"I understand that finding time can be challenging. However, even small amounts of physical activity can make a big difference. What activities do you enjoy doing?",false
120,Client,I like walking.,false
120,Therapist,Walking is an excellent form of exercise. It's also convenient because you can do it anywhere.,false
120,Client,But isn't walking too mild to help with weight loss?,false
120,Therapist,"Actually, even short walks can be beneficial for your health and weight management. And when you have more time, you can always increase the duration or intensity.",false
120,Client,"Oh, wow, that sounds good. I think I might take a short walk after this appointment.",false
120,Therapist,That's a great idea! What else do you enjoy doing that could be a form of exercise?,false
120,Client,"I used to love dancing, but I haven't done it in ages.",false
120,Therapist,Dancing is a fantastic way to stay active while having fun. It's also great that your family would support you if you found a dance class or activity.,false
120,Client,"Yeah, and I think I'd really like to try that.",false
120,Therapist,Would you be willing to look into local dance classes or fitness programs?,false
120,Client,"Actually, I'm kind of excited about it. What else can I do?",false
120,Therapist,"Small changes can add up over time. For example, taking the stairs instead of the elevator or parking further away from a store entrance can increase your physical activity.",false
120,Client,"Mm-hmm, I can definitely do that.",false
120,Therapist,Let's start with these small steps and schedule a follow-up appointment to check on your progress and discuss additional strategies if needed.,false
120,Client,Diet... I'm not sure about that.,false
120,Therapist,"We don't need to focus on drastic changes. Instead, let's explore small, manageable steps that you feel comfortable with, just like we did today.",false
120,Client,"Yeah, I like that. Okay, I'll make an appointment and start dancing soon, doc.",false
120,Therapist,Sounds great! I look forward to seeing you soon.,false
117,Therapist,"Welcome back. What brings you here today, and what do you hope to work on?",false
117,Client,"I'm just tired of my drinking habits. I feel like I've been drinking too much lately, and I thought it would be helpful to talk to someone about it.",false
117,Therapist,"So, you're concerned that your drinking has become a problem for you?",false
117,Client,"Yeah, it's gotten worse over the past six months or so.",false
117,Therapist,What makes you think that it's worsened in recent months?,false
117,Client,"Well, I used to drink like most people do, but after my breakup about a year ago, I started going out more to meet new people. That was around six months ago.",false
117,Therapist,"And since then, you've noticed an increase in your drinking habits?",false
117,Client,"Yeah, especially on Fridays and Saturdays when I go out to try to meet guys. But lately, I've also been drinking more during the week, which isn't like me.",false
117,Therapist,"So, it sounds like you're using drinking as a way to cope with social situations, particularly when trying to meet new people?",false
117,Client,"Yeah, that's right. Drinking helps me feel more comfortable talking to guys.",false
117,Therapist,I see. It's almost like the drinking is giving you a sense of confidence or calmness in those situations?,false
117,Client,"Exactly. But at the same time, it's not really working out for me. I'm not meeting people, and I just end up with bad hangovers.",false
117,Therapist,"That's an interesting dynamic. On one hand, the drinking helps you feel more comfortable, but on the other hand, it's not achieving what you want, and it's causing negative consequences.",false
117,Client,"Yeah, that's right. And it's affecting my daily life too – I'm not eating properly, exercising like I used to, or taking care of myself.",false
117,Therapist,It sounds like you're recognizing the impact that drinking is having on your overall well-being?,false
117,Client,"Yeah, and I just want to stop drinking so much, especially during the week.",false
117,Therapist,"You'd like to cut back on your drinking, but not necessarily quit altogether?",false
117,Client,"Right. I don't feel like I'm an alcoholic or anything, but I do think I need to make some changes.",false
117,Therapist,"So, you're looking for a way to balance your social life with healthier habits?",false
117,Client,"Yeah, exactly. And it's just gotten out of control lately.",false
117,Therapist,Has there been a time in the past when you've tried to cut back on drinking?,false
117,Client,"No, this is the first time I've really struggled with it.",false
117,Therapist,"Okay, well, it's great that you're acknowledging the issue and wanting to make changes. On a scale of 0 to 100, how important is it for you to cut back on your drinking?",false
117,Client,I'd say around 80. That's why I'm here – I want to do something about it.,false
117,Therapist,What makes you choose 80 instead of a lower number?,false
117,Client,"I don't know; it just feels like things have gotten out of hand, and I need to take control.",false
117,Therapist,"You're recognizing that your drinking habits are affecting your life in negative ways, and you want to make a change.",false
117,Client,"Yeah, exactly. It's just gotten too much.",false
117,Therapist,"So, what do you think is the next step for you?",false
117,Client,I guess that's why I'm here – to figure out how to cut back on my drinking.,false
117,Therapist,You mentioned earlier that you'd like to focus on weekdays and try to plan your weekends better. Does that sound like a good starting point?,false
117,Client,"Yeah, that sounds great. I just need to get back into a routine and take care of myself.",false
117,Therapist,It sounds like you're motivated to make some positive changes.,false
117,Client,"Yeah, talking about it makes me realize how much I need to do something about it.",false
123,Therapist,"I've completed your exam, and I have some good news and some concerns to share with you. The good news is that you don't have any cavities.",false
123,Client,That's great.,false
123,Therapist,"However, I'm concerned about the irritation on the roof of your mouth, which appears consistent with tobacco use. You mentioned on your form that you're not a tobacco user, so I'd like to explore this further.",false
123,Client,I don't smoke cigarettes.,false
123,Therapist,I understand. The irritation and discoloration in your mouth suggest otherwise. Can you help me understand what might be causing this?,false
123,Client,"Well, the only thing-- I've never smoked cigarettes ever, but when I go out with my friends, we like to visit lounges.",false
123,Therapist,Mm-hmm.,false
123,Client,"And sometimes they offer us mini cigars, like Swisher sweets, in peach and grape flavors. That's the only time I've used anything with tobacco.",false
123,Therapist,It sounds like you might be underestimating the risks associated with those products. They're still tobacco-based and can cause significant harm to your health.,false
123,Client,"Really? But they're just little, cute cigars.",false
123,Therapist,"I understand why you might think that, but it's essential to recognize the potential dangers of any tobacco product. Can you tell me more about what motivates you to use these mini cigars?",false
123,Client,"Well, I only use them to relax when we go out.",false
123,Therapist,It sounds like you're using them as a coping mechanism. Have you considered alternative ways to manage stress and relaxation?,false
123,Client,"Well, I didn't really think of it as something more than socializing.",false
123,Therapist,"So, you're beginning to see that this might be more significant than just a social activity?",false
123,Client,"Uh, maybe.",false
123,Therapist,What are your thoughts about quitting or reducing your use of these mini cigars?,false
123,Client,"Well, it's something I'll have to think about.",false
123,Therapist,Can you help me understand what's holding you back from considering quitting?,false
123,Client,"Well, it's just something that I do to relax, and I don't do it often. And so I probably could cut back.",false
123,Therapist,"Cutting back is a good start, but quitting would allow you to reverse the damage in your mouth and reduce your risk of other health problems. What are your thoughts about making a change?",false
123,Client,"Well, I don't believe that they're cigars, and what I do believe is that it's my choice.",false
123,Therapist,"I understand that you feel strongly about this being your decision. However, as your healthcare provider, I want to ensure you have accurate information about the risks associated with tobacco use.",false
123,Client,"And so I will think about cutting back, but I'm not at a point where I'm ready to do that.",false
123,Therapist,I appreciate your willingness to consider my concerns. I'll continue to support and encourage you as you think about making a change.,false
123,Client,"Well, it's something that I'll think about.",false
123,Therapist,I hope you'll take the time to carefully consider the potential consequences of continuing to use these products.,false
126,Therapist,"Hi Kaylie, I see you're here to pick up a prescription today. Can you tell me a bit about it?",false
126,Client,"Yeah, my doctor said he called something in.",false
126,Therapist,"Okay, let's take a look. It appears to be a cholesterol statin medication. Do you have any idea how you're supposed to take it?",false
126,Client,"No, not really.",false
126,Therapist,That's okay. I'm here to help clarify things for you. You'll take one tablet once a day. Did your doctor mention anything about potential side effects?,false
126,Client,No.,false
126,Therapist,"Some common side effects include nausea, vomiting, and headache. There are also some more severe side effects, such as dermatomyositis, liver failure, lupus, rhabdomyolysis, and hemorrhagic cerebral infarction. If you experience any of these, please don't hesitate to reach out to your doctor.",false
126,Client,Okay.,false
126,Therapist,Can you tell me a bit more about why you're taking this medication?,false
126,Client,"Um, I'm not really sure.",false
126,Therapist,It's for your dyslipidemia. You'll take one tablet every day. Do you have any questions for me so far?,false
126,Client,"No, I guess not.",false
126,Therapist,"Hi Kaylie, I'm Lori, the pharmacist here at Bulldog Pharmacy. I see that Dr. Ferris called in a new prescription for cholesterol statin 20 today. Can you spare a minute to talk about it with me? I want to make sure you understand how to take it and answer any questions you may have.",false
126,Client,"Sure, I'm just getting some groceries.",false
126,Therapist,What did Dr. Ferris tell you about why you're taking this medication?,false
126,Client,He said I had a blood test for cholesterol and that I should start taking this.,false
126,Therapist,"That's right. This medication will help lower your cholesterol levels, which can reduce your risk of having a heart attack or stroke. How did Dr. Ferris instruct you to take the medication?",false
126,Client,He didn't really tell me; he just phoned it in.,false
126,Therapist,"Okay, no problem. You'll take one tablet of cholesterol statin 20 once a day by mouth, with or without food. When do you usually take your medications?",false
126,Client,"I take all my other medications right before bed, so I guess I could take it then.",false
126,Therapist,"That's perfect. This medication works best when taken in the evening, and it's essential to take it every day.",false
126,Client,Okay.,false
126,Therapist,Where do you store your medications?,false
126,Client,In my nightstand by my bed.,false
126,Therapist,Do you have any children at home?,false
126,Client,No.,false
126,Therapist,"That's good. Medications are best stored away from light, heat, and moisture. What did Dr. Ferris tell you to expect in terms of side effects?",false
126,Client,He didn't mention anything about that.,false
126,Therapist,"This medication is generally well-tolerated, but you might experience some mild muscle aches or pains. If they seem severe, please reach out to Dr. Ferris. Also, this medication can interact with other medications and over-the-counter products, so be sure to check with us before starting anything new.",false
126,Client,Okay.,false
126,Therapist,"Just to confirm, can you tell me how you plan to take this medication?",false
126,Client,"I'll take one tablet in the evening with my other medications, switch to orange juice, and call Dr. Ferris if I experience any severe muscle pains.",false
126,Therapist,"Great, Kaylie! I'm glad we could go over everything together. Do you have any remaining questions for me?",false
126,Client,"No, I think you've answered all my questions. Thank you.",false
126,Therapist,"Hi Kaylie, I'm Lori, the pharmacist here at Bulldog Pharmacy. I see that Dr. Ferris called in a new prescription for cholesterol statin 20 today. Can you spare a minute to talk about it with me? I want to make sure you understand how to take it and answer any questions you may have.",false

126,Therapist,Do you have any children at home?,false
126,Client,"No, I don't have any kids.",false

126,Therapist,"Great, Kaylie! I'm glad we could go over everything together. Do you have any remaining questions for me?",false
126,Client,"No, I think you've answered all my questions. Thank you.",false
4,Therapist,"Hi Emily, it's great to see you again. How have you been?",false
4,Client,"I'm doing alright, thanks.",false
4,Therapist,I've noticed something different about your appearance since our last meeting.,false
4,Client,"(laughs) Oh yeah, my lip piercing!",false
4,Therapist,You got a new lip piercing recently. Can you tell me more about what inspired that decision?,false
4,Client,"Honestly, I just felt like trying something new and standing out in a way.",false
4,Therapist,"It's understandable to want to express yourself differently. As your dentist, I do have some concerns about oral piercings and their potential impact on your teeth and gums.",false
4,Client,"To be honest, I haven't really thought about it too much. I figured my good oral health would minimize any risks.",false
4,Therapist,"You've always taken great care of your teeth, which is wonderful. However, I have seen cases where oral piercings can cause gum erosion or chipped teeth.",false
4,Client,"Yeah, that makes sense. I don't want to compromise my dental health.",false
4,Therapist,What are your thoughts on the potential risks associated with having an oral piercing?,false
4,Client,"Well, I definitely don't want it to affect my teeth negatively. I know I already have some gum issues, and I need to be more diligent about flossing.",false
4,Therapist,Flossing is essential for maintaining good oral health. What would make you consider removing the piercing if you noticed any problems?,false
4,Client,"If I started to see actual damage or issues with my teeth, then I might reconsider keeping it.",false
4,Therapist,That's a reasonable approach. You want to monitor the situation and watch for any potential effects on your teeth.,false
4,Client,"Exactly. And if I do notice any problems, I'll take action to protect my dental health.",false
4,Therapist,"It sounds like you're prioritizing your long-term oral health, which is great. Your teeth are a lifelong investment, after all.",false
4,Client,"(laughs) Yeah, exactly!",false
132,Therapist,"Welcome back, Mr. Green. I'm glad to see you again. Let's review your health results from last week and explore some potential lifestyle changes that could benefit your well-being.",false
132,Client,I'm worried you'll lecture me about my habits and tell me to give up things I enjoy.,false
132,Therapist,"Not at all. You're in control of your own health, and it's up to you to decide what changes you'd like to make.",false
132,Client,"The doctor said I need to take medication for the rest of my life, but I feel fine.",false
132,Therapist,It sounds like you have some concerns about taking medication long-term.,false
132,Client,"Yeah, the doctor said it could save my life, but I'm not sure.",false
132,Therapist,"There are many ways you can improve your health beyond just taking medication. Let's discuss some options together, such as smoking, diet, exercise, and weight loss.",false
132,Client,"Okay, where should I start?",false
132,Therapist,That's entirely up to you. What area would you like to focus on first?,false
132,Client,Where do you think I should start?,false
132,Therapist,"While I can offer suggestions, I think you have a good understanding of what needs attention. What are your thoughts on making some changes?",false
132,Client,"You'll probably say stop smoking and lose weight, right?",false
132,Therapist,"Those would indeed be significant steps forward. Quitting smoking would have a substantial impact, and losing weight would help with your blood pressure, cholesterol, and diabetes risk.",false
132,Client,"I'd love to lose weight, but it's hard to give up things I enjoy.",false
132,Therapist,"It can be tough to know where to start, especially when it comes to making sacrifices.",false
132,Client,I really should do something about my weight. Or should I?,false
132,Therapist,"How important is losing weight to you, and what motivates you to make a change?",false
132,Client,"I want to see my children settled and my grandchildren grow up, and I don't want to be a burden on them.",false
132,Therapist,So your family's well-being is a significant factor in your desire to improve your health?,false
132,Client,"Yes, I want to be there for them without being a burden.",false
132,Therapist,That's a great starting point. What small step can you take towards achieving that goal?,false
132,Client,"I've been thinking about my family a lot lately, and I know I need to make some changes. Maybe I'll start by cutting down on drinking.",false
132,Therapist,That's a great place to begin. Reducing your alcohol intake could have a positive impact on your weight and blood pressure.,false
132,Client,"Actually, I think I'll try to cut out booze altogether. My wife says I drink too much on weekends.",false
132,Therapist,It sounds like you're committed to making some significant changes. That's great!,false
132,Client,And I can also cut back on crisps and pies at work.,false
132,Therapist,What can you do to ensure you don't get hungry at work?,false
132,Client,I'll start having soup for lunch instead of two pies.,false
132,Therapist,"A big bowl of vegetable soup would be a nutritious choice, and it could even count as one or two of your daily servings of fruits and vegetables.",false
132,Client,There's something else I've already done – I stopped adding salt to my food. The doctor said that would help with my blood pressure.,false
132,Therapist,"That's great! Reducing your salt intake has likely benefited you already, and it can also help prevent bone fragility by reducing calcium loss.",false
132,Client,"I didn't know that. It's good to know, and I'll share this information with my wife – her mother had osteoporosis.",false
132,Therapist,"You're off to a great start, Mr. Green. You've thoughtfully considered your options and have some solid plans in place. Let's revisit smoking and exercise next time we meet, when you're ready.",false
132,Client,"I feel like I'm making progress by cutting back on unhealthy foods and drinks, but let's take it one step at a time and see how it goes.",false
132,Therapist,That sounds like a great approach. Shall we schedule our next meeting for the same time next week?,false
132,Client,"Yes, that works for me.",false
132,Therapist,Excellent! I wish you all the best until then.,false
132,Client,"Thanks, you too.",false
7,Therapist,Can you walk me through what happened when you sprained your ankle yesterday?,false
7,Client,"It's pretty embarrassing. I was at a pub crawl and had a few drinks, so I thought it'd be a good idea to catch up with my friends who were ahead of me. I jumped off the bus stairs wearing stilettos for the 90s theme, and then I fell on my ankle.",false
7,Therapist,That sounds like quite an eventful night.,false
7,Client,"Yeah, it was a lot of fun until that happened. Afterward, I didn't feel up to dancing anymore.",false
7,Therapist,It's understandable that you wouldn't want to continue after getting hurt. I'm curious about your drinking habits during the week – would you be open to exploring that with me?,false
7,Client,"Yeah, as long as we don't focus too much on vodka right now...I'm still feeling a bit rough from last night.",false
7,Therapist,You're still experiencing some lingering effects from the previous night. Is that correct?,false
7,Client,"A little bit, yeah.",false
7,Therapist,That must have been quite a night.,false
7,Client,"Yeah, it was pretty wild.",false
7,Therapist,What's a typical week like for you in terms of drinking? Do you usually drink with friends or on your own?,false
7,Client,"Well, my friends and I tend to party on weekends since we're university students. It's just what everyone does – having a few drinks is normal.",false
7,Therapist,"So drinking isn't new to you, and it's something you do regularly with friends.",false
7,Client,"No, not at all.",false
7,Therapist,"Can you give me an idea of what ""a few drinks"" means to you? Is that per night or over the course of a week?",false
7,Client,"If we're going out hard, I can easily have seven or eight drinks. On a regular day after school, I might have a beer or two.",false
7,Therapist,Do you have any concerns about your drinking habits at this point?,false
7,Client,Not really – it's just what everyone does in university.,false
7,Therapist,You're not too concerned because you feel like it's normal behavior for students. Is that right?,false
7,Client,"Yeah, exactly.",false
7,Therapist,Would you be open to looking at some guidelines for low-risk drinking?,false
7,Client,"Sure, yeah.",false
7,Therapist,Let me show you what the safe limits are for women – 10 drinks per week with no more than two drinks per day.,false
7,Client,"Oh, really? That's interesting.",false
7,Therapist,Where do you think your current drinking habits fall in relation to those guidelines?,false
7,Client,"Um, I'd say a bit above that, especially with midterms coming up.",false
7,Therapist,It sounds like drinking is one way you cope with stress. Is that something you've been doing for a while?,false
7,Client,"Yeah, I guess so.",false
7,Therapist,Does it concern you at all that your drinking might be exceeding the recommended limits?,false
7,Client,"Um, well, 10 drinks doesn't seem like much to me, considering my tolerance has built up over time. That's a bit concerning, I suppose.",false
7,Therapist,You've developed a higher tolerance over the years.,false
7,Client,"Yeah, exactly.",false
7,Therapist,Do you see any reasons why reducing your drinking might be beneficial for you?,false
7,Client,"Um, health reasons, I guess. Clearly, I'm not feeling great right now, and I'm more productive when I don't have a hangover.",false
7,Therapist,You can see some advantages to cutting back on your drinking.,false
7,Client,"Yeah, definitely.",false
7,Therapist,Would you be willing to explore this further with me at another time when you're feeling better?,false
7,Client,"Yeah, maybe when I haven't gone all out the night before and sprained my ankle. [laughs]",false
7,Therapist,I'd like to schedule a follow-up appointment for later this week or early next week to discuss your drinking habits in more detail.,false
7,Client,"Okay, that sounds good – just not on a Saturday morning. [chuckles]",false
13,Therapist,"Hi, Mrs. Smith. I wanted to take a moment to discuss today's appointment with you. We'll be administering some vaccines to Lilly. How do you feel about that?",false
13,Client,"Honestly, I'm not sure I'm comfortable with it. I've been doing some research and reading mixed reviews.",false
13,Therapist,Can you help me understand what specifically is causing your concerns about vaccines? What have you come across in your readings?,false
13,Client,"Well, I was thinking maybe it's better for her to develop immunity naturally, rather than relying on vaccines.",false
13,Therapist,"So, you're considering the idea that natural exposure might be a more effective way for Lilly to build up her immune system. Is that right?",false
13,Client,"Yeah, exactly. Like with chickenpox – I had it as a kid and now I'm immune.",false
13,Therapist,That's true; having chickenpox as a child can provide long-term immunity. May I share some additional information about the vaccines we're considering for Lilly today to help you make an informed decision?,false
13,Client,"Okay, sure.",false
13,Therapist,"Before vaccines were developed, natural exposure to certain diseases often led to serious consequences, such as death, disability, or long-term health issues. For example, measles can cause brain damage, deafness, and blindness, while polio can lead to paralysis in children.",false
13,Client,I had no idea it was that severe. I've never even heard of polio before.,false
13,Therapist,"It's understandable you might not be familiar with these conditions; we've made significant progress in eliminating them through vaccination efforts. Now that I've shared this information, how are you feeling about the idea of vaccinating Lilly?",false
13,Client,I guess it seems okay now. My main priority is keeping her healthy and safe.,false
13,Therapist,"It's great that you're taking the time to carefully consider Lilly's health and well-being. As a parent, it's natural to want to make informed decisions for your child.",false
13,Client,"Yeah, I just want to do what's best for her.",false
16,Therapist,"Rick, let's revisit your living situation with Tristan. Considering your goals and the support you need, what are the advantages and disadvantages of staying in this arrangement?",false
16,Client,"It's a nice place, close to work, and I enjoy living with a friend.",false
16,Therapist,That sounds like a comfortable setup. How do you think it will impact your ability to make positive changes with our program and your parents' support?,false
16,Client,"Yeah, that's the thing – I'm not sure if it's the best environment for me to achieve my goals.",false
16,Therapist,Can you elaborate on what makes you uncertain about staying in this living situation?,false
16,Client,"Tristan is a good flatmate, but we're heading in different directions. He doesn't have the same responsibilities as me, and I don't expect him to change his life just because I want to change mine.",false
16,Therapist,That's a fair point. How much does Tristan understand about your desire for change and what you hope to achieve?,false
16,Client,"We've talked about it, and he says he'll be supportive, but I'm not sure if he truly understands what this means to me since we're at different stages in our lives.",false
16,Therapist,What are some potential benefits and drawbacks of moving in with your auntie and uncle?,false
16,Client,"The food would be great, and my whānau is very supportive. However, I worry about losing my independence and autonomy – I value being in charge of myself.",false
16,Therapist,"How do you think this desire for freedom and self-management will impact your goals, particularly when it comes to rebuilding relationships with your partner, children, and whānau?",false
16,Client,"If it means getting my kids back, I'm willing to let go of some of that freedom. I just worry about potentially losing control if I move in with family, even if their intentions are good.",false
16,Therapist,Mm-hmm.,false
16,Client,I'll do whatever it takes to regain custody of my children.,false
10,Therapist,"Hi, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you here today?",false
10,Client,Yeah.,false
10,Therapist,What's been going on that led you to seek help at this time?,false
10,Client,"Well, I'm supposed to come in to learn how to manage my diabetes. I just got diagnosed.",false
10,Therapist,I see. It sounds like your doctor shared some concerns about your A1C levels and blood glucose readings.,false
10,Client,"Yeah, that's what the doctor said. She really emphasized how serious it is. She mentioned potential complications like losing eyesight, problems with my feet, and other issues, which really scared me.",false
10,Therapist,It can be overwhelming to hear about the potential risks associated with diabetes. Can you tell me more about what's been going through your mind since your diagnosis?,false
10,Client,I guess I just feel like there's so much to learn and manage – it feels massive.,false
10,Therapist,"Managing diabetes does require some significant lifestyle changes, including taking medication as prescribed, adopting a healthier diet, exercising regularly, and monitoring your weight. These changes can help you get your diabetes under control.",false
10,Client,"That sounds like a lot to take on, and I'm not sure if I can do everything that's being asked of me.",false
10,Therapist,It's natural to feel uncertain about making such significant changes. Can you tell me more about what's holding you back from feeling confident in your ability to manage your diabetes?,false
10,Client,"If I don't get everything just right, all these terrible things could happen to me?",false
10,Therapist,It sounds like the potential consequences of not managing your diabetes are weighing heavily on your mind.,false
10,Client,[sighs],false
10,Therapist,Let's take a closer look at what it would take to get your diabetes under control. What do you think might be the most challenging part of making these lifestyle changes for you?,false
10,Client,"Well, I-I...",false
19,Therapist,It sounds like you're feeling really frustrated with this situation?,false
19,Client,"Yeah. I just feel like I'm stuck in a cycle of shoplifting, and it's getting out of control. I got caught again, and now I'm facing suspension from school... it feels like my whole life is at risk if I don't make a change.",false
19,Therapist,I see.,false
19,Client,"It's hard because, on the one hand, it's been fun with my friends... but on the other hand, I know it's not good for me. I feel like I need to find a way out of this pattern.",false
19,Therapist,Okay.,false
19,Client,I really want to stop shoplifting and move forward in a positive direction.,false
19,Therapist,It sounds like you're motivated to make a change. You're ready to let go of this behavior.,false
19,Client,"Yeah, that's right.",false
19,Therapist,But it also seems like you're not entirely sure how to do that or what steps to take next.,false
19,Client,"Exactly. I have friends who are involved in this with me, and they're not exactly the best influence... but at the same time, they're my friends.",false
19,Therapist,I understand.,false
19,Client,"And to be honest, shoplifting has been a source of excitement and fun for us... it's hard to imagine giving that up when there aren't many other things in my life that bring me that kind of thrill.",false
19,Therapist,"It can be tough to let go of something that brings you enjoyment, even if it's not good for you.",false
19,Client,"Yeah... exactly. We'd go into the store, steal some CDs... it was working out fine until I got caught again.",false
19,Therapist,I see how that would be a challenge.,false
22,Therapist,I'd like to explore your values clarification handout with you today. Can you share your top five values and what they mean to you?,false
22,Client,"My number one value is family happiness, especially now.",false
22,Therapist,That's a significant priority for you right now. Can you tell me more about why that's so important?,false
22,Client,"Yeah, my family hasn't been on the same page lately, and I feel like if we could just find common ground...",false
22,Therapist,It sounds like you're seeking unity and understanding within your family.,false
22,Client,"Exactly. And for my part, I want to be more present and listen to my family members, so they know how important this is to me.",false
22,Therapist,You want them to understand the value you place on family happiness?,false
22,Client,"Yes, especially now.",false
22,Therapist,It's possible that your family may not realize how much this means to you.,false
22,Client,"Yeah, I think that's true.",false
22,Therapist,And you'd like to express this importance to them?,false
22,Client,Yes.,false
22,Therapist,Your second value is religion. Can you tell me more about why that's significant to you?,false
22,Client,"It was actually my number one value initially, but a challenging situation in my family made me question my faith.",false
22,Therapist,I sense that you're struggling with feelings of doubt and uncertainty.,false
22,Client,"Yeah, it feels like some people in my church community judge me for losing sight of God.",false
22,Therapist,That must be really tough for you. It sounds like you're feeling a bit disconnected from your faith right now.,false
22,Client,"Yeah, but I'm not afraid to admit it.",false
22,Therapist,"You recognize that this is a normal experience, and people often struggle with their faith.",false
22,Client,Exactly.,false
22,Therapist,But sometimes it's hard to talk about these feelings openly.,false
22,Client,Especially in the church community.,false
22,Therapist,It takes courage to acknowledge your doubts. Can you tell me more about what's been going on for you?,false
22,Client,"I just feel like I've lost touch with my faith, and it's scary to admit that.",false
22,Therapist,That sounds really painful. But it also sounds like you're trying to hold onto some sense of hope.,false
22,Client,"Yeah, I'm trying to focus on the positive things in my life.",false
22,Therapist,You're looking for ways to reconnect with your faith?,false
22,Client,"Yeah, and I think that's okay.",false
22,Therapist,"It's okay to not have all the answers right now. Can you tell me more about your other values, like health, inner harmony, and security?",false
22,Client,"Those are important to me too, but I feel like I've been neglecting them lately.",false
22,Therapist,You sense that you're out of balance in some way?,false
22,Client,"Yeah, especially with my family taking up so much time and energy.",false
22,Therapist,It's hard to prioritize your own needs when others are relying on you.,false
22,Client,Exactly. And I feel like I've lost touch with what brings me inner harmony.,false
22,Therapist,You're recognizing the importance of self-care and making time for yourself?,false
22,Client,"Yeah, but it's hard to do that right now.",false
22,Therapist,It sounds like you're feeling a bit overwhelmed.,false
22,Client,"Yeah, I just want to find some sense of balance again.",false
22,Therapist,We can work on exploring ways to help you achieve that. Is there anything specific you'd like to focus on in our next session?,false
22,Client,Thank you for listening and understanding me.,false
22,Therapist,"You're welcome. It was a pleasure talking with you, and I look forward to supporting you further.",false
25,Therapist,"Liz, what's been on your mind lately that you're feeling ambivalent about or would like to change?",false
25,Client,I really want to start working out again and establish a routine to improve my overall health.,false
25,Therapist,What motivates you to make this change at this time?,false
25,Client,"Honestly, I'm tired of feeling sluggish, especially with winter approaching. I crave more energy.",false
25,Therapist,You're experiencing some discomfort with your current physical state.,false
25,Client,"Yeah, I don't like how my clothes fit or feel on me. It's affecting my self-perception.",false
25,Therapist,Can you elaborate on why making this change would be beneficial for you?,false
25,Client,"Exercise has always had a positive impact on my mental and emotional well-being in the past. I want to set a good example for my kids, showing them that physical activity is an essential part of life.",false
25,Therapist,"So, it's about becoming healthier for yourself while also being a positive role model for your children?",false
25,Client,Exactly.,false
25,Therapist,"If you were to incorporate exercise into your daily routine, how would you go about making that happen?",false
25,Client,"I'd need to discuss it with my husband and find a schedule that works for both of us, perhaps finding time in the morning, evening, or on weekends when he's available to watch the kids.",false
25,Therapist,It sounds like you're looking for a balance between prioritizing your own needs and minimizing disruptions to your family routine.,false
25,Client,That's right.,false
25,Therapist,"On a scale from 1 to 10, how important is it for you to start exercising more regularly?",false
25,Client,I'd say around a 7 or 8. It's crucial for me to make this change.,false
25,Therapist,What drives your motivation to rate it so high?,false
25,Client,"I'm fed up with being overweight and feeling unhealthy. I know I need to make a change, but I'm struggling to take the first step.",false
25,Therapist,"To summarize, you're eager to start exercising again due to feelings of sluggishness, a desire to be healthy, and wanting to set a good example for your family. However, you're facing challenges in finding time that works with your family schedule.",false
25,Client,That's exactly right.,false
25,Therapist,"Given this understanding, what steps do you think you'll take next?",false
25,Client,"I might start by going for walks or runs while the weather is still pleasant, look into local gyms with daycare options, and explore ways to make exercise a manageable part of my routine.",false
28,Therapist,"Hi Carrie, thanks for taking the time to meet with me today. I appreciate your willingness to explore this further.",false
28,Client,"Thank you, my doctor recommended that I see someone about my smoking issue.",false
28,Therapist,Can you tell me more about what brings you in? What's been going on with your smoking?,false
28,Client,"Well, I've been struggling with an ongoing problem of trying to quit smoking. It's something I've wanted to do for a long time now.",false
28,Therapist,"So, quitting cigarettes is a goal that's important to you right now. Can you help me understand what's driving this desire to quit at this point in your life?",false
28,Client,"Well, my 15-year-old daughter is really against it, and I'm also concerned about my health issues - asthma, chronic bronchitis, and the beginnings of emphysema. Plus, it's just not socially acceptable anymore.",false
28,Therapist,It sounds like you're feeling a bit isolated as a smoker these days. Like being an outsider in a non-smoking world.,false
28,Client,Exactly! It's embarrassing for me and my daughter when I smoke around her friends.,false
28,Therapist,"That must be really tough for both of you. You want to be a good role model for your daughter, especially at this age when she might be more likely to start smoking herself.",false
28,Client,"Right, and she's already expressed how much she dislikes it when I smoke. It's embarrassing for her, and that makes me feel embarrassed too.",false
28,Therapist,"Okay, so you mentioned some medical problems earlier - asthma, bronchitis... can you tell me more about what happened with your diagnosis?",false
28,Client,"Oh, I remember when my daughter was five, I had a really bad episode where I couldn't breathe because of the humidity. She got scared and called 911.",false
28,Therapist,"Wow, that must have been terrifying for both of you. Your daughter sounds like she's very resourceful and caring.",false
28,Client,"Yeah, she is! And it's been 10 years since then, but I still haven't been able to quit smoking completely. I've tried Chantix a few times, but it didn't work out.",false
28,Therapist,Can you tell me more about what happened with the Chantix? What kind of side effects did you experience?,false
28,Client,"Well, I had nightmares, nausea, stomach problems, and agitation. It was really tough to deal with.",false
28,Therapist,Those sound like some pretty intense side effects. Sorry to hear that it didn't work out for you.,false
28,Client,"Yeah... and even though I tried Chantix a few times, it just didn't fit for me. I had friends who did well on it, but not me.",false
28,Therapist,It's great that you listened to your body and recognized what wasn't working for you. That takes a lot of self-awareness.,false
28,Client,Yeah... and being in menopause doesn't help either! The stress of having a 15-year-old daughter is enough without adding more stress from quitting smoking.,false
28,Therapist,"Absolutely. You're already dealing with so much, the last thing you need is something that's going to make your life harder.",false
28,Client,Exactly!,false
34,Therapist,"Welcome, Nina. I'm looking forward to getting to know you and understanding what brings you here today.",false
34,Client,My doctor referred me because he thinks I've been irresponsible with my pregnancy. He said I've been drinking too much.,false
34,Therapist,It sounds like your doctor is concerned about the potential risks of drinking during pregnancy. Can you tell me more about that?,false
34,Client,"Yeah, I know it's not good for the baby, but I didn't think it was a big deal since my friends weren't worried about it.",false
34,Therapist,"So, there's a part of you that's concerned about the potential harm to your baby, and another part that's influenced by your social circle. Can you help me understand what's been going on with your drinking during pregnancy?",false
34,Client,"I didn't find out I was pregnant until two months in, and I had already been drinking. It's hard to stop when my friends are still partying.",false
34,Therapist,"It sounds like there's a strong social pressure to continue drinking, even though you're aware of the potential risks. How do you feel about giving up drinking altogether?",false
34,Client,"I think I can do it, but it's hard when I'm around my friends and they're all drinking. I don't want to be the mom who's always saying no.",false
34,Therapist,You're struggling with a sense of identity and feeling like you need to choose between being a responsible parent and still being yourself. Can you tell me more about what that feels like?,false
34,Client,"It's like I'm caught between two worlds – the world of partying and having fun, and the world of being a mom and taking care of my baby.",false
34,Therapist,"That must be really tough for you. What do you hope for your future, and how does this pregnancy fit into that vision?",false
34,Client,I want to raise my kid well and not let them down. I feel like having this baby is a chance for me to start over and become a better person.,false
34,Therapist,It sounds like you're looking for a fresh start and a chance to create a new life for yourself and your baby. What do you think would help you feel more confident in making that happen?,false
34,Client,"I think talking to my friends and family about my decision to stop drinking would help, but it's scary because I don't want them to judge me or treat me like a child.",false
34,Therapist,You're worried about how others will react to your new choices. Who do you think can support you in making these changes?,false
34,Client,"Definitely my parents, and maybe other young moms who are going through similar experiences.",false
34,Therapist,That's a great idea. Having a supportive community can make a big difference. Is there anything specific that you'd like to work on or talk about in our next session?,false
34,Client,"Yeah, I think it would be helpful to discuss how to have those conversations with my friends and family about my decision to stop drinking.",false
34,Therapist,"Absolutely. We can definitely explore that further. In the meantime, is there anything that you're willing to commit to in terms of your drinking?",false
34,Client,"Yeah, I know I need to stop drinking altogether. It's just hard to think about what might have already happened to my baby.",false
34,Therapist,"Every day without alcohol is a good day for your baby, and starting today is a great step forward. Would you be open to making that commitment?",false
34,Client,"Yeah, I have to do it.",false
34,Therapist,"That's a big decision, and I'm here to support you. Is there anything else you'd like to talk about or any questions you have before we wrap up?",false
34,Client,"No, just knowing that it's not too late already is enough for me to get started.",false
40,Client,"I've been doing pretty well, considering it's been three months since my last use.",false
40,Therapist,That's a significant milestone. Can you tell me more about what's been going on for you during this time?,false
40,Client,"Well, I've met some new people and—",false
40,Therapist,"Since your last use of meth, is that correct?",false
40,Client,"Yes, that's right.",false
40,Therapist,"Okay, so it's been three months. How do you feel about the progress you've made so far?",false
40,Client,"It's been good. I've been doing pretty well, and I've also met a couple of new friends.",false
40,Therapist,"That sounds like a positive development. Last time we spoke, you were working on distancing yourself from your ex-boyfriend, who was also your dealer. How is that going for you?",false
40,Client,It's been good. I've been avoiding his calls and focusing on meeting new people in my neighborhood.,false
40,Therapist,So it seems like you're making some intentional changes to support your recovery. Can you tell me more about what's working well for you?,false
40,Client,"Yeah, the new friends have been helpful, and I've also been using the breathing exercises you taught me when I feel stressed. Taking a walk and practicing those exercises really helps calm me down.",false
40,Therapist,It sounds like you're finding some effective ways to manage stress and stay on track with your recovery goals.,false
49,Therapist,"Welcome back, Catherine. I'm interested in exploring what's been on your mind since our last meeting.",false
49,Client,Mm.,false
49,Therapist,Can you tell me more about what's changed for you this time around? What are your thoughts about being here?,false
49,Client,My expectations are a bit clearer now as to why I'm here.,false
49,Therapist,That's helpful. It sounds like there's been a shift in your perspective since our last meeting.,false
49,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
49,Therapist,"I sense that we'll be able to work well together. After our last session, I felt that you had the energy and motivation to make positive changes.",false
49,Client,Mm.,false
49,Therapist,Let's discuss what we'd like to focus on during our time together over the next nine months. What are some key areas you'd like to explore?,false
49,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
49,Therapist,One area we touched on last time was your struggles with gambling. You mentioned it had caused problems with your family. Can you tell me more about that?,false
49,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
49,Therapist,I'm wondering how open you are to exploring the underlying issues surrounding your gambling habits.,false
49,Client,"Yeah, I'm happy to explore it.",false
49,Therapist,"When we start discussing uncomfortable topics, it's common to feel a bit uneasy. How do you typically manage those feelings?",false
49,Client,"Hmm. I don't know, I probably shut down a bit.",false
49,Therapist,"That's helpful to know. If you're feeling uncomfortable during our sessions, would you be willing to let me know so we can adjust our conversation?",false
49,Client,"Yeah, um, I'm sure you've already noticed.",false
49,Therapist,"It would be really helpful if you could just say, ""I'm starting to feel uncomfortable"" so we can work through it together.",false
49,Client,Okay.,false
49,Therapist,Let's talk about the issue of gambling and how it's affecting your life. You mentioned owing money to a friend and struggling with debt.,false
49,Client,Mm.,false
49,Therapist,"How serious do you think this issue is, and how important is it for you to address it?",false
49,Client,[sighs] I suppose it's really serious if I want to get out of my debt.,false
49,Therapist,"On a scale of 1 to 100, how confident are you that you can sort out your financial issues and move forward?",false
49,Client,About 80.,false
49,Therapist,"That's a good starting point. Now, let's talk about your dreams and aspirations. What do you hope to achieve in the next five years?",false
49,Client,Maybe I want to have traveled and found the man of my dreams.,false
49,Therapist,Those are exciting goals. How does your current lifestyle align with those aspirations?,false
49,Client,"[chuckles] I'm not going to make a decent mom the way I am now, so I probably need to get on track at some stage.",false
49,Therapist,It sounds like you're considering making some significant changes in your life. What do you think would be the hardest part of taking that pathway?,false
49,Client,I believe it would mean cutting off some of my friendships because they're part of that lifestyle.,false
49,Therapist,That can be a tough decision. How far away do you think you are from making those changes?,false
49,Client,"It seems like an unrealistic dream, but I'd like to take the first step.",false
49,Therapist,What is the first step for you in achieving your goals?,false
49,Client,Probably cutting up my credit cards and trying to restrain myself from temptation.,false
49,Therapist,"That's a great start. We can work on developing strategies to help you manage high-risk situations, such as being at the pub with friends who gamble.",false
49,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
49,Therapist,It might be helpful to explore budgeting advice services that can support you in managing your finances.,false
49,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
49,Therapist,Let's discuss how we can organize a meeting with them. What do you think would be a good first step for you between now and our next session?,false
49,Client,Find the scissors and cut up my credit cards.,false
49,Therapist,[laughs] That's a great start. We'll work on developing a plan to support you in achieving your goals.,false
43,Therapist,"Tanya, thank you for sharing your concerns with me today. I'd like to explore one area of your life where you feel ambivalent about making a change. What's been on your mind lately that you've been struggling to address?",false
43,Client,"Honestly, I've been dealing with a lot of anxiety about an upcoming test. It's a big deal for me, and my self-doubt has been holding me back from preparing for it.",false
43,Therapist,"It sounds like this anxiety is creating a significant obstacle for you, making it hard to feel confident in your abilities.",false
43,Client,"Exactly. I just don't trust myself to do well on the test, so it's easier to avoid thinking about it altogether.",false
43,Therapist,"Avoidance can be a coping mechanism, but it might not address the underlying issue. On a scale of 1 to 10, how confident do you feel in managing your anxiety related to this exam?",false
43,Client,"I'd say around a 4 or 5. It's still scary for me, but I've made some progress by scheduling the test.",false
43,Therapist,That's a great first step! You've acknowledged your anxiety and taken action despite it. What makes you think you might not reschedule this time?,false
43,Client,"To be honest, I'm just tired of putting it off. If I don't pass, I'll have to wait three months to retake it, and that thought is overwhelming. But if I do pass, it'll be a huge weight lifted off my shoulders.",false
43,Therapist,"It's encouraging to hear you thinking about the positive outcomes. However, I sense some self-doubt still lingering. Can you tell me about a time when you overcame anxiety and achieved something despite your fears?",false
43,Client,"Actually, there was a recording project at work where I had to push past my anxiety. I didn't think I'd do well, but it ended up being one of the best recordings, and my supervisor was impressed.",false
43,Therapist,"That experience must have boosted your self-confidence. It's interesting that you mention not trusting yourself, yet you've demonstrated capability in the past.",false
43,Client,"Yeah, it did make me feel good about myself, even though I don't always like receiving compliments.",false
43,Therapist,How do you think you can apply that same bravery and confidence to your current situation with the test?,false
43,Client,"If I pass this test, I'd love to have that same feeling of accomplishment again. It's the same anxiety I had before, but maybe I can learn from my past experience.",false
43,Therapist,"That's a great connection to make! To build on that momentum, what would need to happen for you to feel more confident, say, at a 7 or higher?",false
43,Client,"If I practice and see how I do, and if I have faith in myself, I think my confidence will increase.",false
43,Therapist,"Positive self-talk can indeed go a long way. To summarize, it seems like you're feeling anxious about the test, but this time around, you're more determined to push through. You've had past experiences where you overcame anxiety and felt proud of yourself. Is that correct?",false
43,Client,Yeah.,false
43,Therapist,"Thank you for sharing your insights with me today, Tanya.",false
43,Client,Thank you.,false
46,Therapist,"Jacob, I've reviewed your physical exam results and everything looks normal. Do you have any questions or concerns about your health that you'd like to discuss?",false
46,Client,No.,false
46,Therapist,Okay. I noticed you completed our substance use questionnaire. Would you be willing to go through it with me so we can better understand your situation?,false
46,Client,Sure.,false
46,Therapist,"Before we begin, I want to assure you that everything discussed in this session is confidential. I'll only share information with your parents if you give me permission or if I have concerns about your safety or the safety of others. Is that clear?",false
46,Client,Yeah.,false
46,Therapist,"Let's take a look at your questionnaire responses. I see that you've indicated using alcohol to relax, feel better about yourself, or fit in with friends. Can you tell me more about what leads you to use alcohol in these situations?",false
46,Client,It's not a big deal. Sometimes my friends and I will have a few beers when we're hanging out or at parties.,false
46,Therapist,"How often do you typically drink with your friends, and how much do you usually consume on those occasions?",false
46,Client,"Um, three or four drinks, probably. I don't keep track. We usually drink about once or twice a month.",false
46,Therapist,"So, it sounds like you've been drinking with friends for about six months now. What is it about drinking that you enjoy?",false
46,Client,"Um, I don't know. It's just fun to drink with my friends at parties and stuff.",false
46,Therapist,It seems like you feel more relaxed and have a good time when you're drinking with friends. Is there anything else you'd add to that?,false
46,Client,"Yeah, I guess it tastes good too.",false
46,Therapist,Are there any aspects of your alcohol use that you don't particularly care for or that concern you?,false
46,Client,"Um, I don't like getting sick in the mornings from hangovers and throwing up. That's not fun.",false
46,Therapist,Have you ever experienced a situation where you've been drinking and then couldn't remember what happened afterwards?,false
46,Client,"No, but it happened to someone I know.",false
46,Therapist,"Have you encountered any problems related to your drinking, such as issues at home or school?",false
46,Client,"Um, one time I missed first period because of a hangover and my mom got mad at me.",false
46,Therapist,It sounds like there have been some negative consequences from your drinking. Can you tell me more about what happened with your mom?,false
46,Client,"Yeah, she grounded me for two weeks after that.",false
46,Therapist,"So, it seems like getting into trouble with your mom and missing school are some of the downsides to your drinking. Is that correct?",false
46,Client,"Yeah, but I only missed school once.",false
46,Therapist,I'm glad to see that you've made responsible choices about not driving or riding in a car with someone who's been drinking. Can you tell me more about what leads you to make those decisions?,false
46,Client,"Yeah, I just don't think it's a good idea.",false
46,Therapist,"As your doctor, I want to express my concerns about the potential risks associated with underage drinking. Even if you're not drinking excessively, alcohol can still affect your developing brain.",false
46,Client,Okay.,false
46,Therapist,"Given what we've discussed, how ready do you feel to stop drinking on a scale of zero to ten?",false
46,Client,"Um, probably a five.",false
46,Therapist,"A five? What makes you choose that number instead of something lower, like two or three?",false
46,Client,"Well, I guess I'm just tired of getting in trouble.",false
46,Therapist,What do you think would help you avoid getting into trouble related to drinking?,false
46,Client,"Um, not drinking, I guess.",false
46,Therapist,Have you ever tried stopping or reducing your drinking before?,false
46,Client,"No, not really.",false
46,Therapist,Some people find it helpful to try abstaining from alcohol for a period of time. Would you be willing to try that?,false
46,Client,"Yeah, probably.",false
46,Therapist,How long do you think you could go without drinking?,false
46,Client,I don't know.,false
46,Therapist,Do you think you could manage two months without drinking?,false
46,Client,"Yeah, probably.",false
46,Therapist,What strategies do you think would help make it easier for you to avoid drinking?,false
46,Client,"Um, I could drink something else when my friends are drinking, like just coke.",false
46,Therapist,Are there any other approaches that might work for you?,false
46,Client,"Yeah, hanging out with friends who don't drink or inviting them to parties where not everyone drinks.",false
46,Therapist,Is there someone in your life who could offer support and encouragement as you try to reduce your drinking?,false
46,Client,"Yeah, my friends who don't drink would probably be happy I'm not drinking either.",false
46,Therapist,"It sounds like we've identified some reasons for you to consider reducing your drinking, such as avoiding hangovers and trouble with your mom. We've also come up with some strategies to help you achieve that goal.",false
46,Client,Yeah.,false
46,Therapist,I'm proud of you for taking this step and exploring ways to make positive changes. How about we schedule a follow-up appointment in two months to check on your progress?,false
46,Client,Okay.,false
64,Therapist,"Welcome, Ricky. It's nice to meet you.",false
64,Client,Thank you.,false
64,Therapist,I'm glad you found our location easily. Can you tell me a bit about what brings you here today?,false
64,Client,"Yeah, sure. Um, I guess it started when my friends came over and expressed some concerns about my drug use.",false
64,Therapist,I see. It sounds like their conversation had an impact on you. Can you tell me more about what they said and how you felt about it?,false
64,Client,"Yeah. They were saying that maybe I needed to get some help for my drug stuff, and at first, I was a bit annoyed by that.",false
64,Therapist,You felt defensive or resistant to their concerns?,false
64,Client,"Yeah, but then I started thinking about it more, and I thought, ""Well, maybe it can't hurt to talk to someone about it.""",false
64,Therapist,That takes a lot of courage. It sounds like you're open to exploring your feelings and behaviors around drug use.,false
64,Client,"Yeah, I guess so.",false
64,Therapist,Can you tell me more about what's been going on with your drug use that might be concerning to you or others?,false
64,Client,"Um, well, I've been doing a bit of P now and again, and sometimes I smoke or take party pills on the weekends.",false
64,Therapist,It sounds like you're using substances as part of your social life. Can you tell me more about what that's like for you?,false
64,Client,"Yeah, it's just something that happens when I'm out with friends. It doesn't feel like a lot to me, but when I think about it, maybe it is.",false
64,Therapist,You're starting to question whether your substance use might be having an impact on your life.,false
64,Client,"Yeah, I guess so.",false
64,Therapist,Can you tell me more about what you like about using meth? What are some of the positive effects for you?,false
64,Client,"Um, well, it's just a feeling of being happy and excited, I suppose. It's part of the scene I'm in, and it feels good to be around people who care about me.",false
64,Therapist,It sounds like you've found a sense of community and belonging through this scene.,false
64,Client,"Yeah, that's true.",false
64,Therapist,But are there also some downsides to using meth? Are there any negative effects or problems that you're experiencing?,false
64,Client,"Um, well, money is a big one. I used to have a good job, but now I'm working part-time and struggling to make ends meet.",false
64,Therapist,It sounds like your substance use might be affecting your financial stability.,false
64,Client,"Yeah, that's true.",false
64,Therapist,Are there any other problems or concerns you're experiencing related to your substance use?,false
64,Client,"Um, well, my friends are worried about me, and they've said that if I don't get help, they can't hang out with me anymore.",false
64,Therapist,That must be really tough for you. It sounds like you value those relationships.,false
64,Client,"Yeah, I do.",false
64,Therapist,Let's explore this further. What might happen if you were to make some changes around your substance use?,false
64,Client,"Um, well, I'm not sure. I guess it would depend on what kind of changes I made.",false
64,Therapist,"Okay. Well, let's think about this together. What are some potential benefits or positive outcomes that could come from making some changes?",false
64,Client,"Um, well, maybe I'd be able to pursue my acting career more successfully.",false
64,Therapist,That's a great goal. It sounds like you're passionate about acting.,false
64,Client,"Yeah, I am.",false
64,Therapist,Okay. So what might be a first step towards making some positive changes around your substance use?,false
64,Client,"Um, well, I'm not sure. Maybe just being more mindful of when and how much I'm using?",false
64,Therapist,That's a great start. Being more aware of your behavior is an important first step.,false
64,Client,"Yeah, I guess so.",false
64,Therapist,And are you open to exploring some other options or resources that might be available to support you in making these changes?,false
64,Client,"Yeah, sure.",false
61,Therapist,"Hi Mrs. Smith, I'm Terri, one of Dr. Fields' team members who's worked with you before.",false
61,Client,"Yes, I remember meeting you previously.",false
61,Therapist,"That's right! We met during your last visit. I wanted to follow up on our previous discussion about trying tai chi classes, as suggested by Dr. Fields.",false
61,Client,"Oh, yes... I did attend one class.",false
61,Therapist,How was your experience with the tai chi class?,false
61,Client,"It was lovely to watch, and the instructor was very nice, but I felt quite self-conscious using my walker and having to sit in a chair.",false
61,Therapist,"You enjoyed the atmosphere, but felt uncomfortable due to your mobility issues?",false
61,Client,"Yes, that's right. Very self-conscious.",false
61,Therapist,What motivated you to try tai chi in the first place?,false
61,Client,"Dr. Fields mentioned it could help with my balance, and I'm still experiencing some wobbliness.",false
61,Therapist,"So, improving your balance is a key goal for you?",false
61,Client,"Yes, mostly that.",false
61,Therapist,And what's driving your desire to achieve this goal?,false
61,Client,I want to go home.,false
61,Therapist,What does going home mean to you?,false
61,Client,"Everything. Being with my dog, tending to my garden, and regaining my independence – being able to sleep and wake up when I want, cook for myself...",false
61,Therapist,You're eager to return to your normal life and routines?,false
61,Client,Yes.,false
61,Therapist,What do you think is necessary for you to achieve this goal of going home?,false
61,Client,"The doctors told me I need to be able to walk down the hallway securely with my walker, without feeling unsteady.",false
61,Therapist,Do you agree that mastering this skill is essential for your discharge?,false
61,Client,Yes... although it's a bit daunting.,false
61,Therapist,How would you rate your physical therapy progress so far?,false
61,Client,It's getting better. The pain has decreased somewhat.,false
61,Therapist,"That's encouraging! You're making progress, and you were hoping tai chi could help with your balance issues...",false
61,Client,"Yes, that's right.",false
61,Therapist,Are you interested in giving tai chi another try?,false
61,Client,"(sighs) Yes... I think so. My friend loves it, and I wish I could enjoy it too.",false
61,Therapist,It's ultimately your decision whether to continue with tai chi or not.,false
61,Client,"That's true. After just one session, it wouldn't be fair to say it doesn't work for me.",false
61,Therapist,You're open to giving it another chance because of Dr. Fields' recommendation and your friend's positive experience?,false
61,Client,Yes... I think so.,false
61,Therapist,What needs to happen for you to attend tai chi again?,false
61,Client,"I'd need to make arrangements, which can be complicated, and work on feeling less self-conscious about using my walker.",false
61,Therapist,How confident do you feel about making these arrangements on a scale of 1-10?,false
61,Client,Five... it's just difficult doing things by myself.,false
61,Therapist,What would increase your confidence in making these arrangements?,false
61,Client,"Having some support, like help from my daughter or someone else.",false
61,Therapist,Would having our assistance with the arrangements make a difference for you?,false
61,Client,"Yes, that would be helpful.",false
73,Therapist,"It sounds like he introduced you to oxy, and with his encouragement, you decided to try it.",false
73,Client,"He, um, introduced me to it too, so I've tried it.",false
73,Therapist,You mentioned trying oxy; can you tell me more about that experience?,false
73,Client,Oxy.,false
73,Therapist,I see. And he presented it as a pain management option for you.,false
73,Client,"Well, yeah he said it was a pain- a pain medicine.",false
73,Therapist,He framed it as something that could help alleviate some of the physical discomfort you've been experiencing.,false
73,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
73,Therapist,I understand. You trusted his suggestion and found that it did provide some relief in certain situations.,false
73,Client,"And it has, but I don't do it as often, it's just sometimes.",false
73,Therapist,"It seems like oxy has helped you cope with not only physical pain but also emotional distress, such as dealing with the loss of your grandmother.",false
73,Client,Dealing with my grandma's loss.,false
73,Therapist,That must be very tough for you. It sounds like oxy has been a way to find some comfort during this difficult time.,false
73,Client,"Yeah. I feel alone, and I just, I miss her and, it does- it does help but,-",false
73,Therapist,"While oxy has provided some relief, you're also aware of the potential risks and don't want to rely on it as a long-term solution.",false
73,Client,-I don't wanna have to rely on having to take that.,false
73,Therapist,"You're recognizing that while oxy might be helpful in the short term, you don't see yourself continuing to use it indefinitely. Is that correct?",false
73,Client,"Mm-hmm. Yeah, and—",false
73,Therapist,"It's almost as if you're saying, ""I appreciate the temporary relief, but I'm concerned about becoming too dependent on it.""",false
73,Client,Right.,false
73,Therapist,"That makes sense. You're navigating a lot of challenges right now, and it sounds like you're doing the best you can to manage your emotions and physical discomfort.",false
73,Client,"Yeah, it is.",false
73,Therapist,"It's clear that you have some reservations about using oxy, despite its temporary benefits. Can you tell me more about what's driving those doubts?",false
73,Client,"Yeah, well, I don't really know too much about it, other than it makes me feel good.",false
73,Therapist,"For now, your understanding of oxy is largely based on how it makes you feel in the moment.",false
73,Client,"Okay, so for now you know that it makes you feel good.",false
70,Therapist,"Hi Dr. Martin, I'm Lori, the pharmacist on duty today. I understand you have some questions about citalopram. Can we take a few minutes to discuss your concerns?",false
70,Client,"Yes, that would be great, just for a couple of minutes.",false
70,Therapist,What's been on your mind regarding citalopram? Is there something specific you'd like to know?,false
70,Client,"Honestly, I'm not familiar with it at all, so any information would be helpful.",false
70,Therapist,"Let me start by explaining that citalopram is an SSRI medication primarily used for treating depression. The typical dosage is 20 milligrams, but it's available in 10, 20, and 40 milligram tablets. We usually monitor patients for symptom improvement within four to eight weeks.",false
70,Client,That makes sense. What about potential side effects I should be aware of?,false
70,Therapist,"Common side effects can include gastrointestinal issues, sedation, or sexual dysfunction. If a patient experiences any of these, we can consider adjusting the dosage or switching to an alternative medication. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this point?",false
70,Client,"Actually, does citalopram interact with phenelzine?",false
70,Therapist,That's a great question. I'm not immediately sure about that interaction. May I follow up with you later today to provide a more accurate answer?,false
70,Client,That sounds perfect.,false
70,Therapist,"You're welcome, Dr. Martin. Thank you for reaching out.",false
70,Client,"Thank you, Lori.",false
67,Therapist,I'd like to review the form you completed. This helps me understand your situation better. May we go over it together?,false
67,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
67,Therapist,"It appears that you've used alcohol on a few occasions and marijuana more frequently, about 30 days in the past year. Can you tell me more about that?",false
67,Client,"Yeah, something like that.",false
67,Therapist,"When discussing substance use with students, I want to emphasize that my role is not to dictate what you should do. Instead, I'm here to explore whether there's anything you'd like to change or work on regarding your substance use. What are your thoughts about your marijuana use?",false
67,Client,"Well, I vape using a pen, but I don't smoke it.",false
67,Therapist,How often do you vape marijuana?,false
67,Client,A few times a month.,false
67,Therapist,Do you ever vape anything else besides marijuana?,false
67,Client,"Once, someone shared a peppermint oil with me, and I tried it.",false
67,Therapist,May I share some information about marijuana use that might be helpful for you to consider?,false
67,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
67,Therapist,"Research suggests that marijuana can affect the developing brain, making it harder to concentrate and remember things. Vaping also poses serious risks to lung health. Additionally, about one in six people who start using marijuana as teenagers may develop an addiction later on. What are your thoughts about this information?",false
67,Client,I don't think it will hurt me.,false
67,Therapist,How do you experience the effects of marijuana use personally?,false
67,Client,It helps me relax and have fun with my friends.,false
67,Therapist,Are there any concerns or negative aspects of marijuana use that come to mind for you?,false
67,Client,"Well, I don't want to get in trouble at school.",false
67,Therapist,What kind of trouble are you worried about getting into at school?,false
67,Client,"If I get caught, I could be suspended and kicked off the basketball team.",false
67,Therapist,It sounds like staying in school and playing on the basketball team is important to you. Is that correct?,false
67,Client,Right.,false
67,Therapist,"Considering these priorities, are there any changes you'd like to make regarding your marijuana use?",false
67,Client,"Yeah, I was thinking of not using it during basketball season.",false
67,Therapist,What benefits do you think you'll gain by not using marijuana during the season?,false
67,Client,I play better when I'm not high.,false
67,Therapist,That's a significant benefit. Are there any other advantages to not using marijuana that come to mind for you?,false
67,Client,"Yeah, I won't get caught with my vape pen and risk getting kicked off the team.",false
67,Therapist,It seems like you have a clear goal of not using marijuana during basketball season. How confident do you feel about achieving this goal on a scale from 0 to 10?,false
67,Client,"Um, seven.",false
67,Therapist,"You chose a seven. What makes you more confident in your ability to meet this goal rather than feeling less confident, say at a five?",false
67,Client,"Well, I'm pretty sure I can stop using for a month because I want to play well.",false
67,Therapist,That's great motivation. What strategies do you think will help you stay on track and avoid using marijuana for the next month?,false
67,Client,"Uh, I don't know.",false
67,Therapist,Let's explore this further. What situations or emotions might trigger your desire to vape within the next month?,false
67,Client,"If I'm stressed or unhappy, that's usually when I want to vape.",false
67,Therapist,Are there alternative ways you can manage those feelings instead of vaping?,false
67,Client,"Hmm, I like playing video games.",false
67,Therapist,That's a great option. What else might help you cope with stress or unhappiness?,false
67,Client,Playing basketball with my friend Sarah.,false
67,Therapist,It sounds like you have some healthy alternatives to vaping. I'm glad to hear that you're committed to your goal and confident in your ability to achieve it.,false
67,Client,Yeah.,false
67,Therapist,"If you're willing, I'd love to follow up on your progress in a month or so. Feel free to reach out if you need anything before our next appointment.",false
67,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
67,Therapist,"Good luck with basketball practice! Remember, my door is always open Monday through Thursday if you need any support.",false
67,Client,"",false
79,Therapist,Can you help me understand what led you to realize that things had gone too far?,false
79,Client,"I was in a familiar situation, and it felt like I was repeating past patterns. I wanted to stay in that moment, but at the same time, I knew I'd made a mistake.",false
79,Therapist,It sounds like being in that situation triggered some concerns for you. Can you tell me more about what specifically made you feel like you'd messed up?,false
79,Client,"Well, it was similar to times when I'd come home and take pills. I felt like I was back in that same place, and I didn't want to leave. I also felt like I'd ruined everything, especially after talking to Erin the next day.",false
79,Therapist,Was there a sense of putting something important at risk that contributed to your feelings of guilt and shame?,false
79,Client,"Yeah, I think so. I mean, I could have kept going down that path, but something stopped me. Maybe it was because I knew I had to stop, or maybe it's just that I didn't want to leave that moment.",false
79,Therapist,It sounds like you're reflecting on the fact that you put something important at risk.,false
79,Client,"Exactly. But I'm still trying to figure out why I stopped. Was it because I knew I had to, or was it just because I wanted to stay in that moment?",false
79,Therapist,"You've made significant progress over the past three months, and things have been going well for you.",false
79,Client,"Yeah, they're better.",false
79,Therapist,"And then something shifted, perhaps a sense of hope or possibility, when you were able to see your kids again. That was a goal you'd been working towards.",false
79,Client,"Yeah, that's true.",false
76,Therapist,"Hi Deborah, how are you feeling today?",false
76,Client,I'm doing really well.,false
76,Therapist,You've completed your Values Clarification Sheet. Is there anything that stood out to you or something you'd like to discuss?,false
76,Client,"Yeah, I enjoyed doing it, and I ranked health as my top value because I prioritize physical, mental, spiritual, and emotional well-being.",false
76,Therapist,"So, health is at the forefront of your values.",false
76,Client,"Yes, and it's driving me towards a new career path. I've been working on a certification to become a fitness trainer through Cal State's extension program for five weeks now, and I have a final exam coming up this Saturday. I'm feeling a bit tense about it, but also excited.",false
76,Therapist,It sounds like you're looking forward to this new direction.,false
76,Client,"Yeah, being an office worker was getting boring, and I value physical activity and health. This career change is more aligned with who I am.",false
76,Therapist,"So, your number one value, health, is guiding you towards a more fulfilling path.",false
76,Client,"Exactly. If I could, I'd love to coach tennis or be more involved in sports, but I don't think my skill level is high enough. However, I do enjoy playing and know enough about the game.",false
76,Therapist,Have you completed this values exercise before?,false
76,Client,"Yes, I have.",false
76,Therapist,And has health always been your top priority?,false
76,Client,"It's usually in the top three. This time, I ranked inner harmony as number two, which is interesting because it wasn't in my top 12 previously.",false
76,Therapist,Inner harmony is now a higher priority for you.,false
76,Client,"Yeah, and when I look back at my previous responses, I see that peace and inner peace were mentioned. I've been practicing yoga and teaching it, which has helped me find more inner harmony and feel at peace with myself.",false
76,Therapist,"So, yoga has contributed to your increased sense of inner harmony.",false
76,Client,"Yes, and it's also made me realize that putting myself first isn't selfish. I used to prioritize others' needs over my own, but now I understand the importance of self-love and self-worth.",false
76,Therapist,It sounds like you've had a shift in perspective regarding self-care and prioritizing your own needs.,false
76,Client,"Yeah, I used to think it was selfish to put myself first, but now I see that it's essential for my well-being. And when I do help others, it's not out of obligation, but because it brings me satisfaction.",false
76,Therapist,"So, you've found a balance between taking care of yourself and being there for others.",false
76,Client,"Yeah, service is important to me, and I enjoy helping others. Whether it's having family members stay with me or volunteering in my community, I'm happy to be of assistance.",false
76,Therapist,"It sounds like your values are interconnected, with inner harmony and self-love allowing you to be more present for others.",false
76,Client,"Exactly. And wisdom is also important to me because I enjoy learning about different cultures and experiencing new things. Whether it's through travel or meeting people from diverse backgrounds, I find that it broadens my perspective.",false
76,Therapist,"So, your values are not just individual concepts but are connected and influence one another.",false
76,Client,"Yeah, and pleasure is also important to me because I believe life should be enjoyable. However, I'm aware that there will be challenges and difficulties along the way.",false
76,Therapist,You're acknowledging that life is a mix of positive and negative experiences.,false
76,Client,"Yes, and true joy comes from accepting that it's not always going to be easy or happy. I'll have moments of disappointment and pain, but that's okay.",false
76,Therapist,It sounds like you've developed a sense of acceptance and resilience.,false
76,Client,"Yeah, and my values are like a story that guides me in life. Health is at the forefront, followed by inner harmony, service, wisdom, and pleasure.",false
76,Therapist,"Well, it was great talking to you and exploring your values with you.",false
76,Client,Thanks for listening and encouraging me; it was helpful.,false
88,Therapist,"To clarify, we'd like you to identify three goals for the next 30 days. We'll monitor your progress and check in after a month to see how you're doing. What's something relevant to you that you'd like to work on, either at home or school?",false
88,Client,I need to start getting to school on time for my first hour. I always miss that class.,false
88,Therapist,"So, getting to your first-hour class on time is a goal you'd like to focus on for the next 30 days?",false
88,Client,Yes.,false
88,Therapist,That's a great goal! What motivates you to want to achieve this?,false
88,Client,"I don't want people nagging me. My mom is always telling me to get to school, and my PO says if I'm late, I could face sanctions.",false
88,Therapist,You definitely want to avoid those consequences?,false
88,Client,Yes.,false
88,Therapist,"Okay, so getting to your first-hour class on time is a priority for you. What specific steps do you think you need to take to make that happen?",false
88,Client,"It's hard for me to wake up in the morning, and then I get ready and dressed, but I usually miss the bus. There are many reasons why I'm late.",false
88,Therapist,So it's not just one thing that gets in your way?,false
88,Client,No.,false
88,Therapist,"Knowing that several factors can affect your punctuality, what do you think would be a good starting point for getting to school on time?",false
88,Client,Getting up on time would probably help me get there on schedule.,false
88,Therapist,What time would you need to wake up to catch the bus?,false
88,Client,"I'd need to be up by 6:15, but that's really hard because I go to bed late and don't know if I can do it.",false
88,Therapist,"You're still unsure if this is achievable for you, yet you want to try because of the potential consequences?",false
88,Client,Right. I'll try and see how it goes.,false
88,Therapist,So you're willing to attempt this goal?,false
88,Client,Yes.,false
88,Therapist,What time would you need to go to bed to ensure you wake up at 6:15?,false
88,Client,"If I go to bed around 11:00, that might work. I can try going to bed at 11:00.",false
88,Therapist,"Okay, so you're willing to establish a bedtime routine and set your alarm for 6:15?",false
88,Client,Yes.,false
88,Therapist,When would be a good day to start this new routine?,false
88,Client,Either tomorrow or the next day.,false
88,Therapist,Which day do you think would work better for you?,false
88,Client,Let's start tomorrow.,false
88,Therapist,Tomorrow it is. Who could support you in getting to bed on time and waking up at 6:15?,false
88,Client,My mom.,false
88,Therapist,Your mom. What specific help could she offer?,false
88,Client,"If my alarm goes off and I don't get up, she can come in and wake me up, reminding me that this is something I want for myself.",false
88,Therapist,So you'd like your mom to hold you accountable and remind you of your goal?,false
88,Client,Exactly.,false
88,Therapist,What might hinder your progress in getting up at 6:15?,false
88,Client,Not going to bed on time.,false
88,Therapist,"Not going to bed on time. If you're tempted to stay up late, how could you respond differently?",false
88,Client,"I'll just go to bed and turn off the lights, without my phone.",false
88,Therapist,So keeping your phone away and creating a sleep-conducive environment would help?,false
88,Client,Yes.,false
88,Therapist,And having your mom check on you to ensure everything is in order?,false
88,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
88,Therapist,How will you know if your plan is working?,false
88,Client,"When I'm at school on time, when the bell rings and I'm in class.",false
88,Therapist,So being in your class when the bell rings is a clear indicator of success for you. Let me summarize what we've discussed so far...,false
82,Therapist,I'd like to explore your thoughts and feelings about alcohol use and contraception. Would you be willing to answer some questions and reflect on your current situation?,false
82,Client,Sure.,false
82,Therapist,"We'll be using a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is ""not important"" and 10 is ""very important,"" and similarly for confidence. How important is it for you to drink below risk levels?",false
82,Client,I would say an eight.,false
82,Therapist,"You've rated it an eight. That suggests it's quite important to you. Now, how confident do you feel that you can drink below those risk levels at this time?",false
82,Client,I would say a four.,false
82,Therapist,"A four. Can you help me understand what gives you some confidence, even if it's not very high?",false
82,Client,"Um, I think it's because you've told me I'm at risk and I have alcoholism in my family, and I really don't want to go down that path. So I'm confident that I can change that.",false
82,Therapist,That gives you a strong motivation to make a change. Are there any other factors that contribute to your confidence?,false
82,Client,"Um, well, I have a group of friends that doesn't drink that I hang out with. And when I'm with them, it's not an issue.",false
82,Therapist,So having a supportive social network helps you feel more confident in your ability to manage your drinking?,false
82,Client,Yep.,false
82,Therapist,"That's helpful to know. Now, let's shift our focus to birth control and pregnancy risk. How important is it for you to use effective birth control every time you have sex?",false
82,Client,I would say an eight.,false
82,Therapist,An eight again. That suggests it's quite important to you. And how confident do you feel that you can use effective birth control consistently?,false
82,Client,Probably a six.,false
82,Therapist,"A six. What makes you more confident than not, but still not entirely confident?",false
82,Client,"Um, I'm a six because I think if I drink less, I'll be more reliable with using birth control. When I've had too much to drink, I tend to be less responsible about it.",false
82,Therapist,So there's a connection between your drinking and your ability to use birth control effectively?,false
82,Client,Yeah.,false
82,Therapist,It sounds like addressing your drinking might have a positive impact on your birth control habits as well. Would you like to work on developing a plan to manage your alcohol use before our session ends today?,false
82,Client,Okay.,false
82,Therapist,"And if you need any additional information or support, we can discuss that further.",false
82,Client,Okay.,false
91,Therapist,"Hello, Jean. I'm Dr. Selby. It's nice to meet you.",false
91,Client,"Good morning, doctor.",false
91,Therapist,What brings you here today?,false
91,Client,"Well, doctor, I was diagnosed with a pulmonary disease, COPD, over three months ago, and I really need help quitting smoking.",false
91,Therapist,Can you tell me more about your experience since the diagnosis?,false
91,Client,"Although I didn't call right away, this is my first step towards doing something about it. It's time to take action.",false
91,Therapist,You've been diagnosed by a respirologist. How are you feeling now?,false
91,Client,"I'm really scared because I don't feel well. I haven't felt well for a while, and even simple tasks like talking on the phone with customers trigger coughing fits.",false
91,Therapist,It sounds like your smoking habit has become a significant concern for you.,false
91,Client,Mm-hmm. I'm afraid of what might happen if I don't quit.,false
91,Therapist,Have you thought about when you'd like to quit?,false
91,Client,"I've given myself six months, but it feels like a long time away, and I'm not confident I'll succeed. I only have about 50% faith in myself.",false
91,Therapist,"So, you're feeling uncertain about your ability to quit smoking within the next six months.",false
91,Client,"Yes, that's right. I've tried quitting before with pills, patches, and therapy, but nothing has worked for long.",false
91,Therapist,"You've had some success quitting while in the hospital, but it didn't last once you left.",false
91,Client,"That's correct. I had no choice but to quit while I was there, but as soon as I got out, I started smoking again.",false
91,Therapist,Can you help me understand what makes smoking appealing to you?,false
91,Client,"It's just part of who I am. I started smoking when I was young, and it's always been a part of my life. It helps me relax and calm my nerves.",false
91,Therapist,"So, smoking has become an integral part of your daily routine and self-image.",false
91,Client,"Yes, that's right. It makes me feel sophisticated and relaxed, especially after meals or when I'm with friends who smoke.",false
91,Therapist,You've mentioned the social aspect of smoking as well. Can you tell me more about that?,false
91,Client,"Yeah, it's just something we do together. We'll take a break at work, go outside, and have a cigarette while chatting. It's how we bond.",false
91,Therapist,"So, quitting would mean giving up this social connection with your friends and colleagues.",false
91,Client,"I never thought of it that way, but yes, that's probably true.",false
91,Therapist,Can you tell me what's not so good about smoking for you?,false
91,Client,"Well, it's bad for my health, which is scaring me. I'm also concerned about the cost and how it's affecting my appearance – wrinkles, aging skin, and so on.",false
91,Therapist,"So, there are several negative aspects of smoking that concern you.",false
91,Client,"Yes, definitely.",false
91,Therapist,"On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the most important thing to do, how important is it for you to quit smoking?",false
91,Client,I'd say it's a 10. It's crucial for my health and well-being.,false
91,Therapist,"And on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the most confident, how confident are you that you'll be able to quit?",false
91,Client,"Um, maybe 35 or 40%. I'm not very confident at all.",false
91,Therapist,"What would it take for you to feel more confident about quitting – say, increasing your confidence level to 45%?",false
91,Client,"Maybe if I could come back and see you again, or if there were some group support or suggestions that might help. I just need something to give me a boost.",false
91,Therapist,Would monitoring your smoking habits for the next week be helpful in making progress towards quitting?,false
91,Client,"Yeah, that's a good idea. Writing it down might make me more mindful of my actions and help me feel more in control.",false
91,Therapist,Excellent! I can provide you with a card to track your progress. Can you bring it back to our next appointment so we can discuss further?,false
91,Client,"Yes, that sounds like a plan.",false
94,Therapist,Let's take a moment to explore what brings you here today. What would you like to focus on during our conversation?,false
94,Client,"I'm struggling with motivating someone to make a change, specifically moving out of my house.",false
94,Therapist,Can you tell me more about this situation and how it's affecting you?,false
94,Client,"Well, I offered my home as a temporary solution, but now I'm finding it hard to assert myself and set boundaries.",false
94,Therapist,"That was a kind gesture on your part. Now, however, you're feeling ready for this person to move out and regain control of your space.",false
94,Client,"Exactly. I want change, but I struggle with expressing my needs and setting limits.",false
94,Therapist,What do you think would help you take the next step in asserting yourself and asking this person to leave?,false
94,Client,"Honestly, I'm not sure. Part of me wants the comfort of having someone around, while another part feels it's time for them to go.",false
94,Therapist,"It sounds like you're torn between two conflicting desires. On one hand, you feel a sense of security with this person in your home; on the other hand, you recognize that it's time for them to move on.",false
94,Client,"Yeah, I'm feeling stuck and unsure about what to do.",false
94,Therapist,Your sense of humor seems to be helping you cope with this situation. Can you tell me more about how you use humor as a coping mechanism?,false
94,Client,"Well, laughter helps me get through tough times. Even comedians often use humor to deal with their own struggles.",false
94,Therapist,"That's an interesting perspective. Now, let's explore the potential benefits of having this person move out.",false
94,Client,Hmm... I'm not really sure. I feel guilty about even considering it.,false
94,Therapist,Can you elaborate on what's holding you back from asserting yourself in this situation?,false
94,Client,"Yeah, I think it's a mix of guilt and uncertainty. Part of me wants to do the right thing and help this person, but another part feels like I've done enough.",false
94,Therapist,"It sounds like your values are important to you, and you want to make sure you're doing what's right.",false
94,Client,"Yeah, that's true. But at some point, I need to prioritize my own needs and set boundaries.",false
94,Therapist,What steps have you taken so far to encourage this person to move out?,false
94,Client,"We've had conversations about it, but they haven't always been pleasant. Sometimes I hold things in, and other times I try to be more logical.",false
94,Therapist,Have you discussed alternative living arrangements with this person?,false
94,Client,"Yes, we've talked about some options, which makes me feel better about the situation.",false
94,Therapist,It sounds like having a plan in place is helping you feel more confident about asserting yourself.,false
94,Client,Exactly. Knowing that there are other places for them to go makes it easier for me to have this conversation.,false
94,Therapist,Are you prepared to take concrete steps towards asking this person to leave?,false
94,Client,"Yeah, I've told them they need to be out within a couple of days.",false
94,Therapist,That sounds like a clear plan. What's holding you back from following through with it?,false
94,Client,"Honestly, it's just scary to think about the uncertainty ahead and having to make changes in my own life.",false
94,Therapist,"It can be daunting to face change, but sometimes it's necessary for growth.",false
94,Client,"Yeah, I know. And it's not that I don't care about this person; it's just time for us to move forward as adults.",false
94,Therapist,It sounds like you've thought this through and are ready to take the next step.,false
94,Client,"Yeah, I think so. My goal is to have them out within a couple of days.",false
94,Therapist,I have a feeling your plans will come together.,false
94,Client,Thanks for your support; it means a lot to me.,false
97,Therapist,"Now that we've taken care of your medication, I'd like to discuss a few other health-related matters with you, Mr. Smith.",false
97,Client,Good.,false
97,Therapist,Your blood pressure reading is slightly higher than ideal.,false
97,Client,Yeah.,false
97,Therapist,May I gently bring up the topic of your weight?,false
97,Client,What?,false
97,Therapist,Would you be willing to spend just a couple of minutes discussing your weight with me?,false
97,Client,"You're not serious, are you? I've taken time out of my busy schedule to come here.",false
97,Therapist,I understand that your time is valuable.,false
97,Client,I was kept waiting in the waiting room for 45 minutes.,false
97,Therapist,"That's unacceptable, and I apologize for the inconvenience.",false
97,Client,"If I make an appointment with a client for 10:00, I expect them to start on time, not 45 minutes late.",false
97,Therapist,You value punctuality and respect other people's time.,false
97,Client,"Yeah, I've got other things to do. I have accounts to work on and clients coming in.",false
97,Therapist,"Your schedule is quite demanding, isn't it?",false
97,Client,"Yeah, I'm aware of my weight and the problems it causes.",false
97,Therapist,And you're also aware of the potential solutions.,false
97,Client,"Um, so I don't really need a discussion about it; I just haven't got time to talk about my weight right now.",false
97,Therapist,"It's been a bit of a rush for you coming in today, and I'm sorry again for the wait.",false
97,Client,"Well, it's bad form, isn't it?",false
97,Therapist,"You'd like to get going soon, but I'm asking you to spare just a couple of minutes.",false
97,Client,"Yeah, basically I've got things to do. I need to get back to the office.",false
97,Therapist,"Your work is piling up, and every moment counts.",false
97,Client,"And every time I take a break, it means I have to work in the evening or on weekends.",false
97,Therapist,"That's the reality of being self-employed, isn't it?",false
97,Client,"Well, when you're self-employed, you haven't got a choice.",false
97,Therapist,"Just a couple of minutes, and then we can wrap up.",false
97,Client,"Okay, because I really must get going. If it's just a couple of minutes, yeah?",false
97,Therapist,I promise it'll be quick. Can you tell me how you feel about your weight?,false
97,Client,"About losing weight? Well, obviously, I want to. Who doesn't?",false
97,Therapist,You're aware that your weight is affecting your health.,false
97,Client,"Yeah, I mean, I get out of breath easily, and my blood pressure medication is probably related to it.",false
97,Therapist,"So you see the links between your weight and your health, and you'd like things to be better.",false
97,Client,"Yeah, there are other things too, but yeah, my weight is something I'd like to address.",false
97,Therapist,You'd like to make a change if you could?,false
97,Client,"Yeah, I mean, I know the theories – regular exercise and a balanced diet. But it's hard to find time because of my lifestyle as an accountant.",false
97,Therapist,Your busy schedule makes it challenging to prioritize your health.,false
97,Client,"With me, it's often about convenience foods and eating on the run.",false
97,Therapist,Ready meals and grazing are common for you?,false
97,Client,"Yeah, food is just fuel when I'm juggling so many tasks.",false
97,Therapist,Let me summarize what you've said. You lead a busy life as an accountant...,false
97,Client,Yeah.,false
97,Therapist,"...and you're aware of the links between your health and weight. Ideally, you'd like to make some changes, but it's hard with your current lifestyle.",false
97,Client,"Yeah, because food is just fuel for me when I'm juggling so many tasks.",false
97,Therapist,"You'd like things to be different if you could fit it in, but that's not easy right now.",false
97,Client,No.,false
97,Therapist,Would you be willing to come back and see me in a couple of weeks to discuss this further?,false
97,Client,"Um, okay, I'm up for that, but finding time will still be a challenge...",false
97,Therapist,And you'd like to avoid waiting again if possible?,false
97,Client,"Exactly. If I make an appointment, I don't expect to be kept waiting.",false
97,Therapist,"How about we schedule your next appointment at 8:30, and I'll ensure there's no wait time?",false
97,Client,That'd be good.,false
97,Therapist,We can use that visit to explore how you really feel about moving forward with a healthier lifestyle despite your busy work life.,false
97,Client,"I'll maybe have a look at my schedule, see if anything can be arranged or delegated...",false
97,Therapist,Yeah.,false
97,Client,"...so it's not a wasted interview. I can come here and say, ""Okay, I've looked at my schedules...""",false
97,Therapist,Good.,false
97,Client,...and we can discuss what I've found.,false
97,Therapist,And also give some thought to what we've talked about today?,false
97,Client,"Yeah, of course.",false
97,Therapist,Good stuff. Okay.,false
97,Client,"Okay, thanks. Sorry, I went off a bit.",false
100,Therapist,What brings you to our session today?,false
100,Client,"I'm struggling with my past, specifically my criminal history and how it's affecting my ability to move forward in life.",false
100,Therapist,It sounds like your past is really holding you back from becoming the person you want to be.,false
100,Client,"Yes, that's exactly right.",false
100,Therapist,Can you tell me more about what's specifically blocking you from achieving your goals?,false
100,Client,I'm not entirely sure. I just know that my felony conviction seems to be a major obstacle.,false
100,Therapist,"I see. So, the fact that you have a felony conviction on your record is causing problems for you.",false
100,Client,"Yes, it is. It feels like a life sentence rather than a four-year sentence.",false
100,Therapist,That must be really frustrating for you. Can you tell me more about what happens when you apply for jobs or go through the interview process?,false
100,Client,"Well, I usually don't get callbacks because of my conviction. Even if I do get an interview, it often ends abruptly once they find out about my past.",false
100,Therapist,That sounds like a really tough experience. Have you considered being upfront about your conviction from the start to avoid getting rejected later on?,false
100,Client,Not really. I'm not sure how to bring it up without scaring people off.,false
100,Therapist,"It might be worth exploring that approach, though. Would you consider starting the conversation about your conviction earlier in the process to see if it's a deal-breaker for potential employers?",false
100,Client,I suppose it couldn't hurt to try.,false
100,Therapist,What do you think would happen if you did bring it up early on? Do you think it would make a difference in the outcome?,false
100,Client,Probably not. I think people would still be hesitant to hire me because of my conviction.,false
100,Therapist,That's understandable. It sounds like you're feeling really discouraged about your situation.,false
100,Client,"Yeah, I am. It feels like no matter what I do, I'm always going to be defined by my past mistakes.",false
100,Therapist,I want you to know that you are not alone in this struggle. Many people face similar challenges when it comes to overcoming their past. Have you considered seeking out support from advocacy groups or online resources?,false
100,Client,"Actually, yes. I've been looking into some organizations that might be able to help me.",false
100,Therapist,That's great! There are many organizations dedicated to helping people with felony convictions navigate the job market and rebuild their lives.,false
100,Client,"Yeah, I'm hoping to find some helpful information and support through those channels.",false
100,Therapist,"Well, I think it's great that you're taking proactive steps to address your situation. Remember that you have a lot of strengths and skills to offer, despite your past mistakes.",false
100,Client,Thanks for the encouragement. It means a lot to me.,false
106,Therapist,"I've prescribed an antibiotic for Aiden's ear infection, but reviewing his chart, it seems he's had multiple infections in the past year. Can you help me understand what might be contributing to this pattern?",false
106,Client,Yeah.,false
106,Therapist,It sounds like these recurring infections are causing significant stress for both of you.,false
106,Client,"Yeah, it's really stressful for us. He gets very upset when he's not feeling well.",false
106,Therapist,One potential risk factor for multiple ear infections in children is exposure to smoke. Can you tell me about your smoking habits?,false
106,Client,"I do smoke, but I try hard not to smoke around him. I don't want him exposed to it.",false
106,Therapist,"Despite your efforts, Aiden's frequent ear infections suggest he may still be exposed to smoke. How do you think this might be happening?",false
106,Client,"I'm not sure... I mean, I try really hard not to smoke around him. I go outside when he's home...",false
106,Therapist,I want to emphasize the risks associated with smoking around your child. Not only ear infections but also potential long-term health issues like asthma and dental problems.,false
106,Client,"No, I don't want him to grow up to be a smoker.",false
106,Therapist,Quitting smoking is crucial for both Aiden's health and yours. Have you considered seeking support or resources to help you quit?,false
106,Client,"I've thought about quitting, but it feels really hard... I just don't know how to do it.",false
106,Therapist,"Now might be the perfect opportunity to explore quitting options. There are many resources available, such as nicotine replacement therapy and medications like Chantix.",false
106,Client,I just don't have time for any of that.,false
106,Therapist,Can you help me understand what's holding you back from prioritizing your health and Aiden's well-being?,false
106,Client,"I know it's important... everybody has problems, right? It's just really hard.",false
106,Therapist,What do you think might be more important to you than ensuring Aiden's health and safety?,false
106,Client,I don't know.,false
106,Therapist,I encourage you to take this seriously and consider the potential consequences of not quitting. Can you commit to exploring options for quitting smoking?,false
106,Client,"I'll look into those things... and talk to my doctor about it, I guess.",false
106,Therapist,"Remember, your health and Aiden's well-being depend on making a change.",false
106,Client,Okay...,false
106,Therapist,Let's schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss your progress.,false
112,Therapist,"Chris, I wanted to touch base with you about some concerns that have come up. As Athletic Director, it's my job to support our student-athletes in achieving their best. I've heard rumors about a party over the weekend and understood you were there. Can we talk about how partying and alcohol fit into your life right now?",false
112,Client,"Actually, I'd like to share something that's been bothering me lately. Before that party, as you know, I'm an honor student, and my parents keep a close eye on me, which can be limiting for my social life.",false
112,Therapist,Mm-hmm.,false
112,Client,"About a month ago, friends invited me to a party, using the fact that I always study as an excuse. I convinced my parents I'd spend the night at a friend's house, and that's when I started drinking.",false
112,Therapist,Mm-hmm.,false
112,Client,"It was a unique experience, but also fun in the moment. So, I kept doing it. Last weekend, instead of studying for an exam, I asked my mom to let me go to another party, promising no alcohol or drugs. But I ended up drinking anyway.",false
112,Therapist,Mm-hmm.,false
112,Client,"When my mom picked me up and said she knew I'd been drinking vodka, I felt terrible. I betrayed her trust, which is a big deal for me.",false
112,Therapist,"It sounds like you've been doing everything right as an honor student and athlete, but maybe you're feeling a bit suffocated by the expectations. You started exploring the party scene, and it was fun at first, but now you're noticing some consequences.",false
112,Client,Right. I've become more lethargic and apathetic towards schoolwork.,false
112,Therapist,Mm-hmm.,false
112,Client,"My mind is elsewhere, especially on weekends when I'm trying to find ways to get alcohol with my friends instead of studying.",false
112,Therapist,It's really changed your focus. What do you like about drinking?,false
112,Client,"I don't know... it relaxes me and helps me talk to people more easily. As a reserved person, it makes social situations feel less overwhelming.",false
112,Therapist,"So, it helps you loosen up and feel more at ease.",false
112,Client,Exactly.,false
112,Therapist,"You're noticing some not-so-good things about alcohol, like your mom getting mad at you, decreased focus, and struggling in school. Are there any other concerns?",false
112,Client,"Just that I'm hanging out with different groups of friends now, which can be tense since not all of them are into the party scene.",false
112,Therapist,Mm-hmm.,false
112,Client,"It's like I'm living life, but it's also unfair to my old friends who were always there for me.",false
112,Therapist,"Given all these changes affecting your friendships, studying, and relationship with your mom, where do you think you should go from here?",false
112,Client,"I feel like I should stop. I understand that situations will happen, but it's up to me not to take it too far.",false
112,Therapist,Mm-hmm.,false
112,Client,I need to slowly rebuild trust with my mom and focus on my studies again. It's a big deal for me to regain her trust.,false
112,Therapist,"Your mom is really important to you, and how she feels about you matters.",false
112,Client,Exactly.,false
112,Therapist,How important is it for you to make an adjustment in your drinking or even quit?,false
112,Client,"A lot, because I feel that's key to regaining my mom's trust and getting back on top of my schoolwork and athletics.",false
112,Therapist,Okay.,false
112,Client,"So, I see a future in making this change.",false
112,Therapist,How confident are you that you could actually change your drinking or cut down?,false
112,Client,Pretty confident – maybe an 8 or 9 out of 10.,false
112,Therapist,Why did you say 8 or 9 rather than 6 or 7?,false
112,Client,"Because I'm determined to make this happen. I don't like how I felt after betraying my mom, and I don't want to experience that again.",false
112,Therapist,Mm-hmm.,false
112,Client,"Even if I do drink, I don't want to drink to the point where it gets out of control.",false
112,Therapist,"All right, what's a realistic goal for you then?",false
112,Client,"To get my studies back on track, regain my mom's trust, and focus on leisure time without drinking. If I'm at a party, maybe have one drink maximum, just to be social.",false
112,Therapist,So your goal is to either not drink at all or limit yourself to one drink in social situations.,false
112,Client,Exactly.,false
112,Therapist,"Chris, I really appreciate you talking with me about this. It's clear that it's been on your mind, and I care about you as a student and athlete. You have a good plan going forward, striving for no drinking or limiting yourself to one drink maximum.",false
112,Client,And thank you for listening – it means a lot to me.,false
112,Therapist,It's my pleasure – part of my job is supporting students like you.,false
109,Therapist,"Let's start with the positive news - you don't have any cavities. However, I do want to discuss some concerns I have regarding the irritation in your mouth.",false
109,Client,That sounds serious.,false
109,Therapist,"Yes, it's a condition called nicotinic stomatitis, which is caused by tobacco smoking. Can you tell me more about how tobacco fits into your life right now?",false
109,Client,"Well, I don't smoke cigarettes, but I do occasionally use those small cigarillos when I'm out with friends at bars.",false
109,Therapist,"So it sounds like you've made a conscious decision not to smoke cigarettes due to health concerns. However, you have been smoking the little cigarillos socially.",false
109,Client,"Yeah, that's right. It's just something my friends and I do together. It's not a habit or anything I feel like I need to have.",false
109,Therapist,You're distinguishing yourself from heavy smokers who consume packs of cigarettes daily.,false
109,Client,Exactly. I'm not one of those people.,false
109,Therapist,"Yet, despite the relatively small amount you smoke, it's still causing damage to your mouth.",false
109,Client,"Yeah, now that you mention it, I have started smoking more frequently at work during breaks with my friends who also smoke.",false
109,Therapist,"So smoking has become a bigger part of your social life, including daily breaks at work.",false
109,Client,"Yeah, I guess so. Now that you put it that way, I realize I am smoking on a daily basis.",false
109,Therapist,"What do you enjoy about smoking, aside from the social aspect?",false
109,Client,"It's relaxing and enjoyable to be around people while doing it. Plus, when we go to Las Vegas, visiting cigar bars feels sophisticated and fun.",false
109,Therapist,Okay. Have you noticed any negative effects of smoking?,false
109,Client,"Well, I've been wanting to ask about teeth whitening because I've noticed more stains on my teeth lately, which I assume is related to smoking.",false
109,Therapist,"Yes, we're seeing some negative oral health effects from your smoking. Are there other concerns you have about it?",false
109,Client,"Yeah, the expense is a concern for me, especially with the economy being what it is.",false
109,Therapist,"So you're worried about your oral health, finances, and had previously mentioned concerns about cigarette smoking. Were you aware that those small cigarillos can also have similar negative health effects?",false
109,Client,"No, I didn't think of it as a serious habit or something that could harm me.",false
109,Therapist,It's surprising to you that something you've been doing more frequently is actually bad for your health.,false
109,Client,"Yeah. When I filled out your form and checked ""No"" for tobacco use, I genuinely didn't consider myself a smoker.",false
109,Therapist,"Now that you realize you are a tobacco user, how do you feel about the potential serious health effects?",false
109,Client,I'm really concerned - I don't want to develop cancer or other smoking-related illnesses. This conversation has made me realize I need to take action.,false
109,Therapist,"The good news is that if you stop smoking, you can reverse the negative effects on your mouth and potentially prevent further disease progression.",false
109,Client,Really? That's great to know.,false
109,Therapist,Would you be interested in quitting?,false
109,Client,"Yes, definitely. Like I said, I'm a new smoker - I didn't even realize I was one until now.",false
109,Therapist,"On a scale of 1-10, how confident do you feel about quitting?",false
109,Client,"I'd say around 7 or 8. I don't think it's deeply ingrained in my daily life, so I'm pretty confident I can stop.",false
109,Therapist,What makes you choose that level of confidence?,false
109,Client,Because it's not a huge part of my daily routine - I don't need to smoke when I wake up or throughout the day. I feel like I can manage without it.,false
109,Therapist,"So, just to summarize, you've noticed negative effects from smoking, have concerns about health and finances, yet feel confident in your ability to quit. Where would you like to go from here?",false
109,Client,I'd love more information on quitting strategies and resources - I've heard there are new medications and techniques that can make the process easier.,false
109,Therapist,"Okay, I'd be happy to discuss those options with you and provide tips for a successful quit attempt.",false
109,Client,That would be wonderful. Thank you.,false
109,Therapist,You're welcome. I appreciate your openness about this today.,false
109,Client,Thank you.,false
121,Therapist,"Let's start by making small changes to your daily routine, like reducing sugar in your coffee and increasing exercise.",false
121,Client,That sounds manageable. I can try cutting out sugar from my coffee and see how it goes.,false
121,Therapist,Great idea! Small steps can lead to bigger changes. What do you think about incorporating some form of social exercise into your routine?,false
121,Client,"Actually, that's not a bad idea. I used to enjoy playing squash, and it would be great to get back into it.",false
121,Therapist,That sounds like a good starting point. Having a social aspect to exercise can make it more enjoyable.,false
121,Client,"Yeah, I think you're right. And maybe this is an opportunity for me to reassess my life and make some positive changes.",false
121,Therapist,It's possible that this diagnosis could be a wake-up call for you to take control of your health.,false
121,Client,"You know, now that I think about it, maybe things weren't as great as I thought they were before the diagnosis.",false
121,Therapist,Sometimes we need a push to make changes. What do you think is the first step you can take towards making these changes?,false
121,Client,"Well, I'll start by cutting out sugar from my coffee and looking into joining a gym or squash club.",false
121,Therapist,That's a great plan! And what about your long-term goals? Where do you see yourself in three to five years?,false
121,Client,"Hmm, that's a good question. I suppose I'd like to be healthier and more active.",false
121,Therapist,"Okay, let's break it down further. What specific changes can you make to achieve those goals?",false
121,Client,"Well, I'll start by making small changes to my diet and exercise routine, and then reassess from there.",false
121,Therapist,That sounds like a solid plan. And what about your support system? Who can help you stay on track?,false
121,Client,"Actually, I think talking to Billy at the gym could be helpful. He's always been supportive of my fitness goals.",false
121,Therapist,Great idea! Having a support system in place can make a big difference.,false
121,Client,"Yeah, and maybe this is an opportunity for me to take care of myself and prioritize my health.",false
121,Therapist,"That's a great attitude to have. Remember, it's all about making small changes that add up over time.",false
121,Client,"Yeah, I think I'm starting to see that now. Thanks for helping me realize that.",false
121,Therapist,You're welcome! Let's schedule a follow-up appointment in a month to check on your progress.,false
121,Client,Sounds good to me.,false
115,Therapist,"Let's take a look at your teeth, David. How are you feeling today?",false
115,Client,I'm okay.,false
115,Therapist,Great. Take a look and see what you think about the color and staining. I want to discuss some concerns related to smoking.,false
115,Client,Yeah.,false
115,Therapist,"Possibly due to coffee or tea consumption as well? You've likely heard this before, but I want to make sure we cover all bases.",false
115,Client,"I do all of those things, yeah.",false
115,Therapist,"So, you're aware that smoking affects not just your oral health, but also dental caries and healing in your mouth?",false
115,Client,Yeah.,false
115,Therapist,"It's essential to consider the broader implications. As your healthcare provider, my commitment is to your overall well-being.",false
115,Client,"I've heard it all before, but I just want to get my teeth fixed.",false
115,Therapist,"I understand that's your priority right now. However, there are medications available that can significantly reduce cravings and make quitting easier.",false
115,Client,"I tried a pill once, but it didn't work and had side effects.",false
115,Therapist,It's not uncommon for people to try multiple times before quitting successfully. Research shows an average of seven attempts before achieving success.,false
115,Client,Or seven lectures along the way.,false
115,Therapist,"I'm not here to lecture you, David. I want to support your health goals. You've already shown willingness by trying medication once.",false
115,Client,Yeah.,false
115,Therapist,Would you be open to discussing another prescription and how it could help? This is crucial for both your overall physical health and oral well-being.,false
115,Client,"I guess I need to really want to quit, but the things I've tried usually caused more problems than they helped.",false
115,Therapist,The risks associated with smoking far outweigh any potential side effects from medication. That's what we should focus on.,false
115,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
115,Therapist,"Let's weigh the pros and cons together. I'm concerned about your health, David.",false
115,Client,Okay.,false
115,Therapist,"Before you go, can we schedule a follow-up to discuss this further?",false
115,Client,I-I just don't want to get into that right now.,false
115,Therapist,"I understand. Thank you for listening, and please know that my concern is genuine. Your health matters to me.",false
115,Client,Okay.,false
115,Therapist,I'm here to support you whenever you're ready.,false
115,Client,I appreciate your care.,false
115,Therapist,"You're welcome. Take care of yourself, okay?",false
115,Client,Okay.,false
133,Therapist,"I appreciate you taking the time to meet with me today, Daryl. I sense that you've had experiences with therapists like me before.",false
133,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
133,Therapist,"It's clear that you have some thoughts and feelings about those experiences. I'm interested in exploring them with you today, particularly in relation to your goals for changing your life.",false
133,Client,Right. That sounds good.,false
133,Therapist,Can you tell me a bit about what's been on your mind lately? What are some things you've been thinking about in terms of getting your life back on track?,false
133,Client,I've been thinking about how easy it would be to start dealing again.,false
133,Therapist,"I understand. It sounds like that's a familiar path for you, one that you know well.",false
133,Client,"Yeah, I do. And I've been thinking about how I could set myself up for success in that world.",false
133,Therapist,"I see. So, it's not just about the money or the lifestyle, but also about feeling competent and capable in that world.",false
133,Client,Exactly.,false
133,Therapist,Can you tell me more about what draws you to that life? What are some of the benefits or attractions for you?,false
133,Client,"Well, I've been thinking about how easy it would be to make a lot of money and set myself up well financially.",false
133,Therapist,That makes sense. Financial security can be a powerful motivator. But what about the other side of things? Are there any concerns or doubts that you have about returning to that lifestyle?,false
133,Client,"Yeah, I guess so. I mean, it's not like it's worked out for me in the past.",false
133,Therapist,"That's a good point. It sounds like you're at a bit of a crossroads, trying to decide which path to take.",false
133,Client,"Yeah, I am.",false
133,Therapist,Can you tell me more about what's been going on with Fiona? How has she been supporting you during this time?,false
133,Client,"She's been really clear that if I go back to dealing, it's over between us.",false
133,Therapist,"That must be a lot of pressure. But also, perhaps, a motivation for you to make some changes.",false
133,Client,"Yeah, definitely.",false
133,Therapist,"So, what do you think it would take for you to start making some progress towards your goals? What are some small steps that you could take in the right direction?",false
133,Client,"I'm not really sure. I mean, I know I need to get a job and stuff, but it's hard to see how that's going to lead to anything better.",false
133,Therapist,"That makes sense. It can be tough to see the bigger picture when we're feeling stuck. But sometimes, taking small steps towards our goals can help us build momentum and confidence.",false
133,Client,"Yeah, maybe you're right.",false
133,Therapist,I'd like to explore this idea further with you. What do you think would need to happen for you to start feeling more confident and motivated about your future?,false
133,Client,"I'm not really sure. I mean, I guess I just need to take things one step at a time and see what happens.",false
133,Therapist,That's a great attitude to have. And I'm here to support you along the way. Let's keep exploring this idea of taking small steps towards your goals. What do you think is the first step that you could take?,false
133,Client,I don't know... maybe just getting out of bed in the morning and doing something productive.,false
133,Therapist,"That's a great start! Sometimes, just showing up and being present can be a huge accomplishment. And from there, we can build on that momentum and start to make progress towards your goals.",false
133,Client,"Yeah, okay. I think I can do that.",false
8,Therapist,"What brings you to our session today, Bob? How can I best support you?",false
8,Client,"Honestly, my wife thinks I have a problem with smoking. She's been on this health kick for six months, and now she's always on my case about quitting.",false
8,Therapist,It sounds like you're not too enthusiastic about being here. Can you tell me more about what that's like for you?,false
8,Client,"Yeah, it's an understatement. I'd rather be at work right now, but my wife has been nagging me nonstop since she quit smoking six months ago.",false
8,Therapist,"It sounds like this is a significant source of stress for you, and taking time off to come here is a big deal.",false
8,Client,"Exactly. My wife forced me to come, and I'm only doing it to get her off my back.",false
8,Therapist,Can you help me understand what your wife's concerns are about your smoking?,false
8,Client,She's worried about my health and always shows me articles about the dangers of second-hand smoke.,false
8,Therapist,It sounds like she's really trying to drive home the point. How do you feel when she does that?,false
8,Client,"Frustrated. We used to be able to enjoy a cigarette together, but now I have to go outside. And it feels hypocritical since she used to smoke more than me.",false
8,Therapist,It sounds like you're feeling pretty resentful about the whole situation.,false
8,Client,"Yeah, and my kids are even getting on my case about it too. It feels like they're ganging up on me.",false
8,Therapist,"From your perspective, what do you think might happen if you continue smoking?",false
8,Client,"Well, I guess it could affect my relationship with my wife and family. My dad still smokes at 85, but sometimes I've thought about quitting...I just don't know if I can.",false
8,Therapist,"Let me make sure I understand the situation correctly. Your wife and kids are pressuring you to quit, and you feel like you're being forced into a corner.",false
8,Client,"Yeah, that's right.",false
8,Therapist,"It sounds like your main concern is not so much about your health, but more about wanting things to go back to normal with your family.",false
8,Client,Yeah. I don't want to lose my wife or family over smoking.,false
8,Therapist,It's clear that your relationship with your wife is very important to you. You'd do whatever it takes to make it work.,false
8,Client,"We've been married for 25 years, and this is the first major problem we've had. I'm worried that if things keep going like this...",false
8,Therapist,It seems like we're framing this as an all-or-nothing situation. Either you quit smoking cold turkey or continue as usual. But maybe there's a middle ground here.,false
8,Client,"So, I can actually do it gradually?",false
8,Therapist,"Yes, there are different approaches and medications that can help make the process less abrupt. It might take some time to figure out what works best for you.",false
8,Client,I wish my wife could have come today because she thinks I should just quit right away. Can she come with me to a future appointment?,false
8,Therapist,"Of course, I'd be happy to meet with both of you together.",false
8,Client,"Okay, I'll talk to her and call you back tomorrow to set something up.",false
8,Therapist,"Sounds good. Thanks for coming in today, Bob.",false
8,Client,"Okay, thanks.",false
11,Therapist,What else has led you to seek help at this time?,false
11,Client,They found a small bag of marijuana on me.,false
11,Therapist,I see.,false
11,Client,"It's not a significant amount, though.",false
11,Therapist,You feel it's a relatively minor issue.,false
11,Client,I wasn't planning to sell it or anything; it was just for personal use.,false
11,Therapist,"So, you had enough for your own purposes?",false
11,Client,"Yeah, that's right. And, honestly, in California, nobody really makes a big deal about it.",false
11,Therapist,"You're saying that, in your environment, this isn't seen as a major concern.",false
11,Client,How long will our sessions take?,false
11,Therapist,We have about 15 to 20 minutes for today's conversation. This is just the first of several sessions we'll have over the next six months. I'm sure you're wondering how much time this process will take; that's a natural question. What else would you like me to know about your perspective and goals?,false
11,Client,I just want to get everything done that I need to.,false
11,Therapist,You're focused on completing what's required to move forward?,false
11,Client,"Yeah, that's right.",false
11,Therapist,"Okay. It sounds like you're looking for a way to put this behind you efficiently. Would it be helpful if we used a form to create an agenda together, outlining some goals and ideas for our work over the next few months? This could help me support you in achieving your objectives.",false
11,Client,[No rephrased response needed],false
14,Therapist,"Just to make sure I understand, your goal is to find a balance between enjoying things you like and reducing how much you have of them?",false
14,Client,"Yeah, that's right.",false
14,Therapist,"I sense that this goal is very important to you. On a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being not at all confident and 10 being extremely confident, where would you rate your confidence in starting this new plan?",false
14,Client,"Right now, I'd say around a six.",false
14,Therapist,"A six. That's interesting. You mentioned that when you're faced with tempting situations, your confidence might drop to a four.",false
14,Client,"Yeah, that's probably what will happen.",false
14,Therapist,Okay. Let's explore this further. What makes you think you'll be at a four instead of an even lower number?,false
14,Client,"Well, I've been wanting to make these changes for years, ever since I became more aware of my body and health.",false
14,Therapist,That's a long time to have had this goal in mind. Can you tell me more about what drives your desire to be healthier and more active?,false
14,Client,"It's just that all my friends are really into sports and hiking, and they're healthy and fit... I want to be like that too.",false
14,Therapist,"You aspire to a certain level of health and fitness, not just for appearance but also for overall well-being.",false
14,Client,Exactly. I want to feel good about myself and be able to enjoy activities without feeling self-conscious.,false
14,Therapist,What do you think would help boost your confidence in achieving this goal?,false
14,Client,"Honestly, I'm not sure... I guess just reminding myself that I've wanted this for a long time and that I can do it if I set my mind to it.",false
14,Therapist,You're aware of your inner strength and ability to accomplish things you set out to do. Can you think of another time in your life when you faced a challenge and overcame it?,false
14,Client,"(pauses) Yeah, there have been times... but what was it about me that made those successes possible?",false
20,Therapist,I'd like to discuss Aiden's recent ear infections and the fact that someone in the household smokes. Can you tell me more about your smoking habits?,false
20,Client,"Well, it's just me and him, and I do smoke. I try hard not to smoke around him, but as a single mom with a full-time job, stress has led me to start smoking again after quitting during pregnancy.",false
20,Therapist,It sounds like you're using smoking as a way to cope with the stresses of being a single parent.,false
20,Client,"Yeah, some people have a glass of wine; I have a cigarette.",false
20,Therapist,You've made an effort not to smoke around Aiden. What motivated that decision?,false
20,Client,"I know it's not good for him, and I've read about the risks of ear infections and asthma. However, other kids get ear infections without their parents smoking, so I'm unsure if my smoking is really the cause.",false
20,Therapist,"On one hand, you're concerned about how your smoking might affect Aiden, but on the other hand, you're not convinced it's the primary cause of his health issues?",false
20,Client,"Right. He doesn't have asthma, and he hasn't had many other problems that his friends have, so I'm unsure.",false
20,Therapist,"You've thought about quitting before, but it seems impossible right now.",false
20,Client,"Yeah, exactly.",false
20,Therapist,What drove you to quit smoking during pregnancy?,false
20,Client,"I knew we were sharing everything, and I couldn't live with myself if something happened to him. The risks seemed too great at the time.",false
20,Therapist,"Right now, quitting feels almost too difficult to manage or even attempt.",false
20,Client,"Yeah, exactly.",false
20,Therapist,How did you successfully quit smoking during pregnancy?,false
20,Client,"Honestly, I'm not sure how I did it. I just knew I couldn't risk anything happening to him, so I stopped.",false
20,Therapist,"The risks were so scary then that you were able to stop, but they don't feel as daunting now?",false
20,Client,"No, we're two separate people, and I try hard not to smoke around him.",false
20,Therapist,You're doing the best you can do in this situation.,false
20,Client,Yes.,false
20,Therapist,"However, it sounds like part of you genuinely wants to quit smoking.",false
20,Client,"Yeah, I know I need to, but every year I say I'll quit, and something gets in the way.",false
20,Therapist,"Quitting is on your to-do list, but it's not a priority right now?",false
20,Client,Yeah.,false
20,Therapist,"If you decided to quit, how confident do you feel that you could succeed, on a scale of 1 to 10?",false
20,Client,"Probably around a 5. I'm unsure because I've done it before, but the situation is different now, and it seems really hard.",false
20,Therapist,What makes you say 5 instead of a lower number?,false
20,Client,"I know all the reasons why smoking is bad for me and Aiden, and I don't want him to grow up thinking it's okay to smoke. But I'm still unsure if I can quit.",false
20,Therapist,"It sounds like you have many reasons to quit, you've been successful in the past, but right now you're feeling hesitant about your ability to do so?",false
20,Client,Yeah.,false
20,Therapist,Where would you like to go from here?,false
20,Client,"I don't know. I'd like some help, but I'm not sure what kind of help I need.",false
20,Therapist,"If you're interested, we can discuss new options that have helped people quit smoking more successfully.",false
20,Client,I don't like medicine.,false
20,Therapist,There are also support groups and classes where you can connect with others who are quitting. Sometimes having that support makes a big difference.,false
20,Client,"That sounds nice, but I'm not sure if I have the time for all that.",false
20,Therapist,It feels like something that would take up too much time and might not fit into your life. Can we explore options that might be more feasible for you?,false
20,Client,That would be really nice.,false
20,Therapist,"If you're willing, we can schedule another appointment to discuss those options further.",false
20,Client,I would like that. That would be great.,false
20,Therapist,Great.,false
20,Client,Thank you.,false
20,Therapist,Sure.,false
23,Therapist,"Hi Hannah, it's nice to meet you. I understand that your GP referred you to me due to some anxiety difficulties you've been experiencing.",false
23,Client,"Yeah, I guess so.",false
23,Therapist,Can you tell me more about when these anxiety difficulties started? You mentioned it was around five or six years ago?,false
23,Client,"Yeah, it kind of started then. It's escalated a bit since I moved out of my parents' house recently.",false
23,Therapist,That can be a big change. Was this your first time leaving home?,false
23,Client,"Yeah, it is. I considered moving out a few years ago, but I thought it would be easier to stay at home.",false
23,Therapist,"So, how has this transition been for you? You mentioned it's made things worse.",false
23,Client,"Yeah, I feel like it has. I'm just staying in the house a lot and not really doing anything.",false
23,Therapist,That sounds really tough. How are you feeling about being here today?,false
23,Client,"Scared, I guess. Hopefully, it will help.",false
23,Therapist,You're feeling anxious about our session today. Can you tell me more about what's been going on since you moved out? How has your anxiety affected your daily life?,false
23,Client,"Um, I thought things would be better, but they're actually worse. I'm just staying in the house a lot and not really interacting with anyone.",false
23,Therapist,That sounds really isolating. Can you tell me more about what's been difficult for you? You mentioned being a photographer.,false
23,Client,"Yeah, my anxiety has stopped me from taking on certain jobs or interacting with people. It's hard for me to make friends or have relationships.",false
23,Therapist,"So, your anxiety is affecting both your work and social life. Can you give me an example of a recent situation where you felt anxious?",false
23,Client,"Um, I was doing a fashion shoot and I had to work with a lot of people. I thought it would be fine, but it ended up being really hard for me.",false
23,Therapist,What happened during that shoot? What were some of the thoughts going through your head?,false
23,Client,"I just felt really hot and sweaty, and I couldn't breathe. I thought everyone was looking at me and thinking I was stupid.",false
23,Therapist,That sounds really overwhelming. Can you tell me more about what you did to try and cope with those feelings?,false
23,Client,I tried to focus on my camera and hold it tightly. I didn't want anyone to see how anxious I was.,false
23,Therapist,"So, you were trying to hide your anxiety from others. How did that work for you?",false
23,Client,It didn't really. I still felt like everyone could tell I was being weird.,false
23,Therapist,Okay. Can you tell me more about what happened after the shoot? Did you do anything to try and calm down?,false
23,Client,"Um, no. I just went home straight away. I didn't want to be around anyone else.",false
23,Therapist,That sounds like a really tough experience. Is there anything that you're hoping to get out of our sessions together?,false
23,Client,"Yeah, I guess I just want to feel better and not be so anxious all the time.",false
32,Therapist,"To confirm, the report from Minnesota State University's security department indicates that you were stopped on Stadium Road last Friday and cited for driving under the influence. You were then transported to detox. Given your age of 21, can you help me understand what happened?",false
32,Client,"I'm not really sure... it was a week ago, and I had been drinking.",false
32,Therapist,I want to make sure I understand your perspective. Behavior like this could have serious consequences for your academic career. How do you feel about the potential risks involved?,false
32,Client,"Honestly, it doesn't concern me that much. Once I turn 21 in a couple of months, I won't be considered a minor anymore. I don't think I'm a heavy drinker compared to my friends, and I just need to be more careful.",false
32,Therapist,Can you help me understand what was going through your mind when you decided to drive after having six beers? You could have put yourself or others at risk of serious harm.,false
32,Client,"It didn't seem like a big deal at the time. My roommate was sleepy, so I had to find another way home. This situation isn't entirely my fault, though. I often give him rides, and he wasn't available this time.",false
32,Therapist,"I want to encourage you to take responsibility for your actions. Continuing down this path could lead to serious consequences, including legal problems, poor grades, health issues, and disappointing your parents. Is that something you're willing to consider?",false
32,Client,"No... like I said, this isn't entirely my fault. Can we wrap things up? I have a class in 15 minutes.",false
32,Therapist,"As a student at Minnesota State University, it's essential to understand the expectations around behavior and responsibility. To continue as a student here, you'll need to demonstrate that you can follow our rules. Are you willing to work towards that?",false
32,Client,"Yeah... I get what you're saying. You make some good points, and I'll think about them.",false
32,Therapist,"Your sanction will include university disciplinary probation and attendance at an alcohol education seminar, which comes with a $150 fee. Please keep in mind that any further violations could result in suspension for one semester or longer.",false
32,Client,$150 is a lot... I don't know if I can afford it.,false
26,Therapist,What's been on your mind lately?,false
26,Client,"I just want to make my phone call, that's all I'm asking for.",false
26,Therapist,I understand you're upset about having your phone privileges taken away. Can you tell me more about what happened?,false
26,Client,"[scoffs] Yeah, it's like one of the officers has a personal issue with me or something. I don't know what it is - maybe it's because I didn't make my bed or my attitude. All I know is I want to make my call.",false
26,Therapist,It sounds like you're feeling frustrated and unsure about why this happened. Can you help me understand more about the situation?,false
26,Client,"I just want to contact my mom, that's all.",false
26,Therapist,"You've been a model resident here, always respectful and cooperative. Is there something specific going on with your upcoming release in three weeks that might be contributing to these issues?",false
26,Client,"I just want to talk to my mom, that's it.",false
26,Therapist,"I can imagine how difficult this must be for you, especially since you're used to speaking with your mom regularly. And with your dad's birthday coming up tomorrow, I'm sure you're feeling even more anxious to reach out.",false
26,Client,"My dad's birthday is tomorrow, and I just want to make my call so I can talk to my mom.",false
26,Therapist,"It seems like this is an unusual situation for you, given your positive behavior here. Are you experiencing any anxiety or frustration about your upcoming release that might be contributing to these issues?",false
26,Client,(no response),false
35,Therapist,"Hi Natalie, I'm Dawn. It's great to meet you.",false
35,Client,"Hi Dawn, nice to meet you too.",false
35,Therapist,"Thank you for taking the time to come in today, I appreciate it.",false
35,Client,Thanks for having me.,false
35,Therapist,Can you tell me a bit about yourself and what brings you here?,false
35,Client,"So, I'm 28 years old and I moved to Arizona about six months ago. I enjoy spending time with family and friends when I can, but work keeps me pretty busy. Lately, I've been thinking about making some changes to my diet and physical activity because I'm not happy with my current weight.",false
35,Therapist,It sounds like you're feeling a bit unhappy with your health habits right now?,false
35,Client,"Yeah, I'm really starting to notice how sluggish I feel and my mood has shifted a lot too. At first, I thought it was just the weather changing, but I think it might also be related to my lack of activity and the foods I've been eating.",false
35,Therapist,So you're experiencing low energy and you're wondering if your current habits are contributing to that?,false
35,Client,"Right. Especially when I look back on times when I was more active, I notice a big difference in my energy levels and mood.",false
35,Therapist,Can you tell me more about those times when you were more active? What did that feel like for you?,false
35,Client,"Yeah, well, I played sports in college, which kept me really busy. Looking back, I'm amazed at how much I could fit into a 24-hour period. I think being physically active gave me the energy to do all those things and still have time for friends and school.",false
35,Therapist,It sounds like you had a lot of momentum and energy during that time.,false
35,Client,"Yeah, exactly. And now it's not the same. When I get home from work, I'm exhausted and it takes a lot of effort to want to be physically active after staring at a computer all day.",false
35,Therapist,"So your days are still full, but your energy levels aren't what they used to be. What do you think might have contributed to that change?",false
35,Client,"Um, well, I think part of it is that when I was in college, I had a commitment to my team and scholarship money, so I didn't really have a choice about being active. Now it's up to me to make that choice.",false
35,Therapist,So you're recognizing the difference between having external motivation versus internal motivation for physical activity.,false
35,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
35,Therapist,And you're looking back at your past experiences and wanting to incorporate more physical activity into your life again?,false
35,Client,"Yeah, I think so. Not necessarily to run a marathon or anything, but just to have more energy and a better outlook on life.",false
35,Therapist,You've noticed that exercise has a positive impact on your mood in the past.,false
35,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
35,Therapist,Can you tell me more about what you notice specifically about your mood when you're physically active?,false
35,Client,"I just feel happier, more upbeat, and my outlook is more positive. Even little things like sitting in traffic don't bother me as much because I feel like I've already accomplished something that day.",false
35,Therapist,So physical activity gives you a sense of accomplishment and helps you feel less irritated by everyday stressors.,false
35,Client,"Mm-hmm. Yeah, exactly.",false
35,Therapist,Let me make sure I understand your concerns correctly. You moved to Arizona six months ago and are trying to establish new routines for yourself. You're looking back on your past experiences as an athlete in college and recognizing the impact that physical activity had on your energy levels and mood.,false
35,Client,"Yeah, and also my weight. I'm not happy with it right now.",false
35,Therapist,Can you tell me more about when you started feeling dissatisfied with your body?,false
35,Client,"Um, probably three or four months ago. My clothes were fitting tighter, which wasn't comfortable, and I just didn't feel good about my appearance.",false
35,Therapist,"So this is a relatively new concern for you, and it's affecting your self-confidence.",false
35,Client,"Yeah, I think the lack of physical activity and not eating well has contributed to that.",false
35,Therapist,It sounds like you're hoping to regain some confidence in yourself by making changes to your diet and physical activity.,false
35,Client,Mm-hmm. Yeah.,false
38,Therapist,"Hi Sarah, I'm Delwyn, a counselor here at the clinic. Your nurse practitioner mentioned that your recent annual exam touched on smoking and alcohol use. Can you tell me more about what was discussed?",false
38,Client,"Yeah, my nurse practitioner expressed concerns about how much I'm smoking and drinking. I agreed to work on cutting back on smoking, but I don't think my drinking is a problem.",false
38,Therapist,"So, you're open to reducing your smoking, but you're not as concerned about your drinking habits.",false
38,Client,"Right, I just don't see it as an issue since I only have a couple of drinks a day. It's actually a way for me to unwind and relax.",false
38,Therapist,"Drinking serves as a stress-relief mechanism for you, helping you cope with daily pressures.",false
38,Client,"Exactly, it's my ""me time"" after a long day of work and taking care of my son.",false
38,Therapist,"I understand that your life is quite hectic, juggling work, parenting, and school. Can you tell me more about what that's like for you?",false
38,Client,"Yeah, as a single mom working full-time and going to school, it's exhausting. My job as a server is physically demanding, and I worry about making ends meet.",false
38,Therapist,It sounds incredibly challenging. You're not only dealing with the physical demands of your job but also worrying about providing for your son.,false
38,Client,"Yeah, and on top of that, I'm trying to figure out how to pay for school. It's all just really overwhelming right now.",false
38,Therapist,That makes sense. It seems like you feel like you need some kind of break or reward after a long day.,false
38,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
38,Therapist,"Can you tell me more about your drinking habits? How much do you typically drink, and what's the pattern been like?",false
38,Client,"Well, I don't really understand why it's a concern. I only have two drinks a day at most.",false
38,Therapist,"So, you're drinking around two drinks per day. Have you heard about the recommended guidelines for drinking levels?",false
38,Client,"No, not really.",false
38,Therapist,Would you be interested in learning more about those recommendations?,false
38,Client,Sure.,false
38,Therapist,"Okay, well, the recommendation is no more than three drinks a day and seven drinks per week for women. This is to reduce the risk of accidents, chronic diseases, and psychological problems.",false
38,Client,"I didn't know that. Two drinks a day doesn't seem like a problem to me, especially since my family members drink more than that without issues.",false
38,Therapist,"It's understandable that you wouldn't see it as an issue, especially when comparing yourself to others.",false
38,Client,"Yeah, and honestly, I'm getting a bit annoyed because I feel like everything I enjoy is being taken away from me. First, it was smoking, and now drinking.",false
38,Therapist,"You really value your alone time and relaxation after a long day, and you're worried about losing that.",false
38,Client,"Yeah, exactly.",false
38,Therapist,"It also sounds like your drinking has increased over time, especially with the added stress of school and work.",false
38,Client,"Yeah, I guess so. With being so stressed out every day, it's just become part of my routine.",false
38,Therapist,"So, you've noticed that when you're more stressed, you tend to drink more.",false
38,Client,"Yeah, I suppose that's true.",false
38,Therapist,"Let me summarize what you've shared with me so far. You have a very stressful life, and you feel like you need some kind of reward or stress relief.",false
38,Client,Uh-huh.,false
38,Therapist,"And on the other hand, you've noticed that your drinking has increased over time, especially when you're feeling more stressed.",false
38,Client,Yeah.,false
38,Therapist,Have you experienced any problems as a result of your drinking?,false
38,Client,"No, not really. Although sometimes I feel guilty for wanting to unwind and relax instead of spending time with my son.",false
38,Therapist,"So, you've noticed that it's starting to call to you in the evenings, taking you away from things that are important to you.",false
38,Client,Yeah.,false
38,Therapist,And it doesn't feel good?,false
38,Client,No.,false
38,Therapist,"It sounds like there's a bit of a dilemma here. On one hand, you value your alone time and relaxation, but on the other hand, you're worried about how drinking might be affecting your life.",false
38,Client,Yeah.,false
38,Therapist,And perhaps you've never seen it in that light before?,false
38,Client,"No, I haven't.",false
38,Therapist,It seems like changing this pattern would be quite challenging for you.,false
38,Client,"Yeah, it's part of my routine now, and I don't want to give up something I enjoy. But at the same time, I'm trying hard to be a good mom and balance everything else in my life.",false
38,Therapist,"So, it seems like changing your drinking habits would be difficult because it's something that's really important to you right now.",false
38,Client,Yeah.,false
38,Therapist,"However, it also sounds like there are things that you value more than drinking, such as being a good mom and taking care of yourself.",false
38,Client,Yeah.,false
38,Therapist,Have you thought about other ways to cope with stress without relying on drinking so much?,false
38,Client,"Well, if I could find another way to relieve some of my stress, I think I would feel better and maybe wouldn't need to unwind in the same way at night.",false
38,Therapist,"So, if you could tackle some of these stressful issues, that might make a difference. What do you think would help with that?",false
38,Client,"Probably finding more reliable childcare. My mom normally watches my son, but she's been backing out lately, and it's stressing me out.",false
38,Therapist,Having more reliable childcare could make a big difference.,false
38,Client,"Yeah, definitely.",false
38,Therapist,"And it sounds like your mom has been an option in the past, but perhaps not so much anymore.",false
38,Client,"Yeah, I think she's just getting stressed out too. I feel bad because it shouldn't be her problem, but I need something more reliable.",false
38,Therapist,"So, one thing that could make a big difference is finding more affordable and reliable childcare. That might help you not want to drink as much.",false
38,Client,Yeah.,false
38,Therapist,Anything else?,false
38,Client,"Well, most of my problems always come back to money. If I had more money, I could afford daycare, work less hours...",false
38,Therapist,It sounds like having more financial stability would make a big difference for you.,false
38,Client,Yeah.,false
38,Therapist,"You're working full-time and going to school to address that in the long run, but it's not an immediate solution. Have you thought about other ways to cope with stress better?",false
38,Client,Not really.,false
38,Therapist,"Given our conversation so far, where do you think you are with everything?",false
38,Client,"I'm willing to consider changing my drinking habits, but actually doing it is a different story. I have a lot of problems to work out right now.",false
38,Therapist,"So, it would be helpful if you could narrow down one thing to focus on. What would that be for you?",false
38,Client,"Childcare, probably.",false
38,Therapist,Okay. It sounds like that's a major issue for you. Have you looked into alternative childcare options?,false
38,Client,Not really. I just normally ask my mom if she can watch my son.,false
38,Therapist,One thing you could consider is talking to one of our social workers who specialize in helping people find resources they need.,false
38,Client,"Yeah, that sounds helpful.",false
38,Therapist,Would you be interested in meeting with a social worker to explore some options?,false
38,Client,"Yeah, definitely.",false
38,Therapist,Okay. I can set that up for you. Is there anything else you'd like to do or discuss before we meet again?,false
38,Client,"No, not really.",false
38,Therapist,Would you be interested in thinking about setting a goal with respect to your drinking?,false
38,Client,"Well, I could try going back to one drink a night instead of two.",false
38,Therapist,Okay. That's a good starting point. You can try cutting back and see how that goes.,false
38,Client,"Yeah, I'll try.",false
38,Therapist,And we can meet again in a couple of weeks to check in on your progress with cutting back on drinking and exploring childcare options?,false
38,Client,"Yeah, sounds good.",false
38,Therapist,"Okay, great. I look forward to talking next time.",false
38,Client,"Okay, thanks.",false
44,Therapist,"Hi Andrea, thanks for coming in today. I'd like to get to know you better and discuss your life, goals, and behaviors. We'll be meeting a few times this semester.",false
44,Client,Okay.,false
44,Therapist,Can you start by telling me a bit about yourself?,false
44,Client,"Well, my name is Andrea, and I'm involved in music - I play the tenor sax in the marching band, jazz band, and wind ensemble.",false
44,Therapist,That's impressive. How long have you been playing the saxophone?,false
44,Client,"About four years, but I've been involved in music for around 10 years, starting with violin when I was younger.",false
44,Therapist,"Wow, that's a great background in music. What do you enjoy most about being in the marching band?",false
44,Client,I like the group setting and working together to put on a show. It's exciting and exhilarating during competitions.,false
44,Therapist,That sounds like a great experience. Do you have friends outside of band or are they mostly from your classes?,false
44,Client,I have two separate groups - friends from class and friends from band.,false
44,Therapist,"Okay, that makes sense. Can you tell me a bit about your family?",false
44,Client,"I have an older brother, parents, and a golden retriever named Charlie.",false
44,Therapist,That sounds like a lovely family. What are your plans after high school?,false
44,Client,"I'm planning to go to college and eventually become a doctor, possibly specializing in psychology or psychiatry.",false
44,Therapist,Those are ambitious goals. Have you thought about which schools or majors you're interested in?,false
44,Client,"Not too much yet - everyone wants to aim for the Ivy leagues, but I haven't decided on specifics.",false
44,Therapist,"Okay, we can discuss that further later. How are your grades currently?",false
44,Client,"They're pretty good, around a 3-point something GPA.",false
44,Therapist,That's great. What do you like to do for fun on weekends?,false
44,Client,"Usually hang out with friends, go to the movies, or just relax at someone's house.",false
44,Therapist,Okay. Is there ever drinking involved when you're hanging out?,false
44,Client,"Sometimes, yeah - I'm being honest.",false
44,Therapist,How often would you say you drink alcohol?,false
44,Client,"Depending on schoolwork, maybe every other weekend or a few times a month.",false
44,Therapist,And how much do you typically drink on those occasions?,false
44,Client,"Not to the point of getting blackout drunk, but just a little tipsy.",false
44,Therapist,Okay. Have you ever had any negative experiences with drinking?,false
44,Client,"Yeah, I learned my lesson after one time when I got really drunk and didn't like it.",false
44,Therapist,"Got it. So, your friends also drink, right?",false
44,Client,"Some of them do, not all.",false
44,Therapist,And how much do they typically drink?,false
44,Client,"Similar to me - maybe one or two cups, but sometimes more.",false
44,Therapist,"Okay, so it's a bit of a social thing for you. Your level of drinking puts you in a high-risk group - are you aware of that?",false
44,Client,"A little surprised, yeah.",false
44,Therapist,"We call it high-risk because there's a chance of bad consequences like accidents, fights, or health problems. Have you thought about those risks?",false
44,Client,"Not too much, to be honest - I figured since we're all friends and sleep over each other's houses, we avoid some of the bigger risks.",false
44,Therapist,"Okay, but it's still important to consider those risks. Let's talk about making some changes. Do you think you could quit drinking?",false
44,Client,"Yeah, I think I could - I don't need it, and it's often just used as a way to get the party started.",false
44,Therapist,"Okay, so what would be your plan for quitting?",false
44,Client,I'd start by telling my friends I'm not going to drink anymore and see how that goes.,false
44,Therapist,That sounds like a good start. But you don't sound very confident it'll work - what's holding you back?,false
44,Client,"It's hard when everyone else is drinking, and there's pressure to fit in.",false
44,Therapist,"Okay, so how can you overcome that pressure and quit drinking without your friends thinking you're stupid?",false
44,Client,"I'm not sure - my close friends would understand, but others might give me a hard time.",false
44,Therapist,It sounds like those friends might not be the best influence. Maybe it's better to focus on your band friends who don't drink as much.,false
44,Client,"Yeah, that's true.",false
44,Therapist,"Okay, so let's set a goal for you to quit drinking. Can you do that?",false
44,Client,"Yeah, I think I can.",false
44,Therapist,Great. And what about when your friends ask why you're not drinking - how will you handle that situation?,false
44,Client,"Um, I'm not sure - what should I say?",false
44,Therapist,You could explain to them the risks of drinking and how it's affecting your life. Tell them you've thought about it and decided it's not worth it.,false
44,Client,"Okay, that makes sense.",false
44,Therapist,"And remember, if they're really good friends, they'll support your decision. Any other questions or concerns?",false
44,Client,"No, I think I'm good.",false
44,Therapist,"Alright, let's plan to meet again in a couple of weeks to check on your progress. Sound good?",false
44,Client,"Yeah, sounds good.",false
41,Therapist,I appreciate you taking the time to come in today. How are you feeling about our conversation so far?,false
41,Client,"I'm doing great, actually.",false
41,Therapist,That's wonderful to hear. Can you tell me more about what's been going on that's making you feel this way?,false
41,Client,"Yeah, it's just a really good day.",false
41,Therapist,It sounds like things are falling into place for you right now.,false
41,Client,"Yeah, they are.",false
41,Therapist,I'd love to explore that further. You mentioned doing some value clarifications - what were your top five values that came out of that exercise?,false
41,Client,"Yes, it was a really valuable experience for me. It was different from what I'm used to. There were several things that stood out, and my number one value was self-respect.",false
41,Therapist,That's fascinating. Self-respect isn't always something people put at the top of their list. What do you think led you to prioritize it this time?,false
41,Client,"Yeah, I think there have been some recent events that made me realize how much I've consistently put others first and neglected my own needs.",false
41,Therapist,"That can be a really challenging pattern to break. Can you tell me more about what you mean by ""putting others first"" and how that's affected your life?",false
41,Client,"Well, it means I've often prioritized other people's opinions and expectations over my own desires and values. It's been a hard habit to recognize, but I'm glad I finally have.",false
41,Therapist,That takes a lot of courage to acknowledge. How do you think this realization will impact your relationships with others?,false
41,Client,"I feel like it will actually make me a better person for them, because I'll be more authentic and respectful of my own needs.",false
41,Therapist,"By taking care of yourself, you're able to show up more fully for others.",false
41,Client,"Exactly. When I'm stressed or resentful, I'm not the best version of myself.",false
41,Therapist,It sounds like recognizing your own value is key to breaking this pattern. Can you tell me more about what that means to you?,false
41,Client,"Yeah, it means I get to be my own parent and give myself the things I need, rather than relying on others for validation.",false
41,Therapist,That's a really powerful shift in perspective. How does it feel to prioritize your own needs like this?,false
41,Client,"It feels amazing - jubilant, even. Like I finally matter.",false
41,Therapist,That sense of self-worth is essential to living a fulfilling life.,false
41,Client,"Yeah, and it's not selfish at all. It's necessary.",false
41,Therapist,Absolutely. What else came up for you during this process that felt important?,false
41,Client,"Well, my second value was inner harmony. I realized I need to be at peace with myself before I can be harmonious with others.",false
41,Therapist,"That makes sense. When we're not at peace internally, it's hard to show up peacefully in our relationships.",false
41,Client,"Exactly. And then I put family happiness as a top value, because when I'm happy and fulfilled, that benefits my whole family.",false
41,Therapist,It sounds like you're recognizing the interconnectedness of your own well-being and the well-being of those around you.,false
41,Client,"Yeah, exactly. When I prioritize my own needs, everyone benefits.",false
41,Therapist,That's a beautiful way to look at it. What about health and achievement - how do those values fit into this new perspective for you?,false
41,Client,"Well, achievement is about feeling a sense of accomplishment and fulfillment in what I do. It's not just about showing up or doing the minimum.",false
41,Therapist,You want your work to be meaningful and impactful.,false
41,Client,"Yeah, exactly. And that means being true to myself and my values, rather than just going through the motions.",false
41,Therapist,That sense of purpose is essential to feeling fulfilled.,false
41,Client,"Yeah, it's not enough for me to just show up and collect a paycheck. I want to make a real difference.",false
41,Therapist,It sounds like you're recognizing the importance of living in alignment with your values.,false
41,Client,"Yeah, exactly. And that means being creative and taking care of myself, too.",false
41,Therapist,Creativity often comes from a place of inner peace and quiet reflection.,false
41,Client,"Exactly - when I'm not stressed or overwhelmed, I can tap into my own creativity and intuition.",false
41,Therapist,Thank you for sharing this journey with me today. It's been an honor to witness your growth and insight.,false
41,Client,Thank you for listening and supporting me on this path.,false
56,Therapist,"Hi, Mrs. Smith. I'm Denise, a social worker here at the clinic working with Dr. Fields and our team. Since you've recently returned home from rehab, I'd like to explore how things have been going for you.",false
56,Client,It's been pretty good so far.,false
56,Therapist,Can you tell me more about what's been positive for you since returning home?,false
56,Client,"Well, I'm glad to be back with my dog, and it feels great to be in my own space again. My garden is also coming along nicely, and my neighbors have been supportive.",false
56,Therapist,It sounds like being at home has brought you a sense of comfort and joy. What specifically about being home are you most grateful for?,false
56,Client,"I'm glad to see my dog, and it's nice to be in familiar surroundings again.",false
56,Therapist,That makes sense. Being in a comfortable environment can be very uplifting. How have your physical therapy and Tai Chi sessions been going?,false
56,Client,"Actually, I didn't attend either of those this week.",false
56,Therapist,"Was there something that prevented you from attending, or was it just not feeling up to it?",false
56,Client,"I had a bit of a scare when I almost fell, but I didn't actually fall. It made me realize that maybe I've been pushing myself too hard.",false
56,Therapist,That can be really frightening. It sounds like you're feeling a bit uncertain about your balance and safety at home.,false
56,Client,"Yeah, exactly. I'm worried that if I do fall, I might get hurt badly and end up back in the hospital.",false
56,Therapist,That's a valid concern. What are some thoughts you've had about how to prevent falls or ensure your safety at home?,false
56,Client,"Well, I've heard of people using those emergency alert systems, but I'm not sure if that would work for me.",false
56,Therapist,Those systems can be very helpful in case of an emergency. We could explore options like that together.,false
56,Client,"Yeah, that might be a good idea. I just don't want to end up back in the hospital.",false
56,Therapist,Absolutely understandable. Let's focus on finding ways to support you in staying safe at home. What do you think would make you feel more secure?,false
56,Client,Maybe having someone check in on me regularly or having access to emergency services if needed.,false
56,Therapist,Those are great ideas. We can look into setting up a system for regular check-ins and exploring emergency alert options.,false
56,Client,That sounds good. I just don't want to be alone and unable to get help if something happens.,false
56,Therapist,"You're not alone in feeling that way, Mrs. Smith. Many people share your concerns about safety at home.",false
56,Client,Really? It's nice to know I'm not the only one.,false
56,Therapist,"Definitely not. Now, let's talk about your Tai Chi classes. Do you think you'll continue with those?",false
56,Client,"I'm not sure. I was really enthusiastic about it at first, but now I'm feeling a bit uncertain.",false
56,Therapist,That's understandable. Sometimes our priorities or feelings about certain activities can shift over time.,false
56,Client,"Yeah, exactly. But I do know that Dr. Fields recommended Tai Chi for preventing falls.",false
56,Therapist,"Yes, she did mention that it could be beneficial in that regard. Perhaps we can discuss ways to modify your approach to Tai Chi or find alternative exercises that might work better for you.",false
56,Client,That sounds like a good idea. I just don't want to give up on staying active and safe at home.,false
56,Therapist,"You're showing great determination, Mrs. Smith. We'll work together to find solutions that support your goals.",false
56,Client,Thank you. Just talking about this has made me feel a bit better.,false
56,Therapist,That's wonderful! Sometimes just sharing our concerns can help us feel more in control and prepared for the future.,false
50,Client,"I'm concerned that my doctor thinks my blood pressure is a bit high, but I don't think it's an issue. I eat well and take care of myself. My doctor suggested cutting back on caffeine, but I don't see it as a problem.",false
50,Therapist,"Earlier, you mentioned that caffeine might be contributing to your agitation. Can you help me understand where you stand on this? Do you feel like caffeine affects you at all?",false
50,Client,"Sometimes it makes me jittery and I need to use the bathroom more often, which can be inconvenient at work. However, it also helps me stay awake and focused during long shifts.",false
50,Therapist,"So, there are both positive and negative effects of your caffeine consumption. You feel more alert and able to do your job better, but you're also experiencing some drawbacks.",false
50,Client,"Exactly. And maybe my blood pressure is a bit high, but—",false
50,Therapist,"Let me summarize what I've understood so far. On the one hand, caffeine helps you stay aware and focused at work. On the other hand, it causes some issues with your coworkers and potentially affects your blood pressure.",false
50,Client,That's right.,false
50,Therapist,"And sometimes, despite its benefits, you feel jittery and less relaxed than usual.",false
50,Client,"Yes, that's true. But I really enjoy my coffee and feel like it helps me stay observant and alert.",false
50,Therapist,How do you think your current caffeine intake is working for you? Do you feel like four cups a day is the right amount?,false
50,Client,"Yeah, I think so. Although some of my coworkers who work night shifts drink even more than that.",false
50,Therapist,What would happen if you were to reduce your caffeine intake slightly? Might that alleviate some of the problems you're experiencing?,false
50,Client,You mean reducing the number of cups I drink per day? How much are we talking about?,false
50,Therapist,That's up to you. You mentioned earlier that you really enjoy your morning cup and the ritual surrounding it.,false
50,Client,"Yeah, I love waking up and making coffee. It's a special part of my daily routine.",false
50,Therapist,"So, reducing your caffeine intake might be challenging for you, especially since you value that morning cup so much.",false
50,Client,Exactly. But maybe I could cut back on one of the other cups during the day.,false
50,Therapist,That sounds like a great idea. You've identified one area where you're willing to make a change and see how it goes.,false
50,Client,"Yeah, I think that's doable.",false
50,Therapist,"Okay, good. It sounds like we have a plan in place.",false
50,Client,Yeah.,false
53,Therapist,"Hi Laura, thanks for coming in today. I want to start by explaining what our meetings will be about. We'll have a chance to get to know each other and discuss your goals, interests, and any challenges you're facing.",false
53,Client,Okay.,false
53,Therapist,Can you tell me a little bit about yourself?,false
53,Client,"My name is Laura, I'm 17, and I'm a senior in high school.",false
53,Therapist,What do you enjoy doing in your free time?,false
53,Client,"Mostly just hanging out with friends on the weekends, going to the mall or movies, and sometimes parties.",false
53,Therapist,"That sounds like fun. When you're with your friends, what kinds of activities do you usually do?",false
53,Client,"We might go to a school game or event, or just hang out at someone's house.",false
53,Therapist,What are some hobbies or interests that you enjoy outside of school?,false
53,Client,"I like reading and spending time outdoors, whether it's walking or hiking.",false
53,Therapist,That sounds great. What are your plans after high school?,false
53,Client,I'm thinking about applying to college and maybe studying journalism or pre-law.,false
53,Therapist,Those are both interesting fields. What motivated you to consider those options?,false
53,Client,"Well, I'm not really into math or science, so I started looking at careers that might be a good fit for me.",false
53,Therapist,That makes sense. How do you think your grades will impact your college plans?,false
53,Client,"I'm doing okay in school, mostly getting A's and B's.",false
53,Therapist,Great job! What classes are you finding most challenging?,false
53,Client,"Actually, all my grades are pretty good right now.",false
53,Therapist,That's terrific. Have you thought about where you'd like to apply to college?,false
53,Client,"Not yet, but I'm looking at schools in the area and considering whether I'll stay close to home or not.",false
53,Therapist,Okay. Let's talk a bit more about your social life. You mentioned going to parties with friends. Do you drink alcohol at these events?,false
53,Client,"Not really, maybe just one or two drinks at most.",false
53,Therapist,How often do you think you have alcohol in a typical month?,false
53,Client,Maybe once or twice a month.,false
53,Therapist,"So it's not a regular part of your social life, but you do drink occasionally. What's the most you've ever had to drink at one time?",false
53,Client,"Just two drinks at a party, and I don't really like getting drunk.",false
53,Therapist,That's good to hear. Have you ever been in a situation where you felt pressured to drink more than you wanted to?,false
53,Client,"Yeah, sometimes my friends will try to get me to drink more, but I just pretend to have a drink so they'll leave me alone.",false
53,Therapist,"I understand. It can be tough to navigate those situations. Let's talk about some of the risks associated with drinking, especially for teenagers. Are you aware of the dangers of drunk driving?",false
53,Client,"Yeah, I know it's not safe and can lead to accidents or worse.",false
53,Therapist,"Exactly. And there are other risks too, like increased risk of assault or injury when you're under the influence. Have you thought about those potential consequences?",false
53,Client,"Yeah, that's one reason I don't like to drink much.",false
53,Therapist,"Okay. Well, it sounds like you have a good understanding of the risks. What do you think is the most challenging part of staying safe in social situations?",false
53,Client,I guess just being around people who are drinking and feeling pressure to fit in.,false
53,Therapist,That makes sense. Let's talk about some strategies for staying safe and avoiding those pressures. Do you have any ideas?,false
53,Client,"Well, maybe just finding things to do with friends that don't involve drinking.",false
53,Therapist,That's a great idea! And what if your friends aren't willing to change their behavior? What would you do then?,false
53,Client,I guess I'd try to hang out with them less or find new friends who share my values.,false
53,Therapist,"Okay. It's also important to think about how your choices might impact your future goals, like getting into law school. Do you see how drinking could potentially get in the way of those plans?",false
53,Client,"Yeah, definitely.",false
53,Therapist,"Alright, well let's summarize what we've discussed today. You're aware of the risks associated with drinking and you're willing to make some changes to stay safe. Is that right?",false
53,Client,Yeah.,false
53,Therapist,Great! I'm going to write down that you've decided to quit drinking and we'll check in again next semester to see how things are going. Sound good?,false
53,Client,Okay.,false
53,Therapist,"And finally, is there anything else you'd like to talk about or any questions you have for me?",false
53,Client,"No, I think that's all.",false
53,Therapist,"Alright, well thanks for coming in today Laura!",false
65,Client,I've been told by many people that quitting smoking will likely lead to weight gain.,false
65,Therapist,You're considering the potential consequences of quitting.,false
65,Client,"Food doesn't taste great to me now, but others say it's much more enjoyable after quitting.",false
65,Therapist,That's an interesting perspective on how your relationship with food might change.,false
65,Client,"However, gaining weight is a concern for me, and that would mean needing new clothes, which I'd like but can't afford right now.",false
65,Therapist,It sounds like you're weighing the potential benefits against some practical challenges.,false
65,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
65,Therapist,"You've had a long history with smoking, 18 years on and off, and it's become an integral part of your life.",false
65,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
65,Therapist,I sense that you're worried about how quitting will affect your daily routines and habits.,false
65,Client,Right.,false
65,Therapist,"Your concerns about quitting seem to be centered around the potential negative outcomes, such as weight gain. Can you tell me more about what's on this list of concerns?",false
65,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
65,Therapist,What else might be contributing to your hesitation about quitting?,false
65,Client,Withdrawal is a big one – I've heard it can be really tough. And being irritable.,false
65,Therapist,Those sound like significant challenges. How do you think your friends will respond if you decide to quit?,false
65,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
65,Therapist,"So, in addition to the physical aspects of withdrawal, you're also thinking about how others might react to your decision.",false
65,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
65,Therapist,What else comes to mind when considering the potential downsides of quitting smoking?,false
65,Client,"Honestly, I think all the negative aspects are related to my long history with smoking. It's hard for me to imagine life without it.",false
65,Therapist,That makes sense – you've had a long relationship with smoking.,false
65,Client,"I know I need to quit, and thankfully, I'm not experiencing any health problems from smoking yet, but the doctor's warning about potential future issues has made me rethink everything.",false
65,Therapist,It sounds like that conversation was a wake-up call for you.,false
62,Therapist,How are you doing today?,false
62,Client,"I'm good, thanks.",false
62,Therapist,Great. Can you fill me in on what's been going on since our last session?,false
62,Client,"Um, everything seems fine, I guess. My caseworker mentioned something about community service, but I'm not really sure about the details.",false
62,Therapist,"Okay, it sounds like your caseworker touched base with you about community service, but you're feeling a bit unclear on what's expected.",false
62,Client,"Yeah, that's right. She said something about getting so many hours in, but I wasn't fully paying attention.",false
62,Therapist,Can you tell me more about what you do remember from your conversation with your case manager? What are your thoughts about community service so far?,false
62,Client,"I know I have to get it done by the end of my probation, but that's about it. I'm not sure how many hours or if someone will help me find a place to do it.",false
62,Therapist,"Okay, got it. So you're aware that community service needs to be completed by the end of your probation, but some details are fuzzy.",false
62,Client,Exactly.,false
62,Therapist,Would it be helpful if I went over the requirements with you and clarified some of the details?,false
62,Client,"Yeah, that would be great.",false
62,Therapist,"Okay. So, just to confirm, you have 25 hours of community service left to complete by the end of your probation. Your case manager can help you find a place to do it.",false
62,Client,"Okay, got it.",false
62,Therapist,"There are various options for community service, such as food pantries or shelters. Would any of those interest you?",false
62,Client,"Um, yeah, I just want to make sure I understand that I need to find the community service hours myself?",false
62,Therapist,That's correct. You can work with your case manager to find a place that fits your interests and schedule.,false
62,Client,Okay.,false
62,Therapist,"If you're feeling stuck, we can also help facilitate phone calls to potential community service sites.",false
62,Client,Okay.,false
62,Therapist,I sense that you're eager to complete the community service hours quickly. Would breaking it down into smaller chunks on a calendar be helpful for you?,false
62,Client,"Yeah, that sounds like a good idea.",false
62,Therapist,Sometimes having a visual plan can make it feel more manageable. Do you think committing to a schedule would help you stay on track?,false
62,Client,"Yeah, I think so.",false
62,Therapist,What other questions do you have about community service?,false
62,Client,I think that's it. I just wanted to clarify who was responsible for finding the community service hours and making sure I complete them.,false
62,Therapist,"Absolutely. Remember, if you have any more questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to me or your case manager.",false
62,Client,"Alright, thank you.",false
68,Therapist,"Hi Andrea, thank you for taking the time to meet with me today. I want to start by explaining my role and how our conversations will work.",false
68,Client,"Okay, that sounds good.",false
68,Therapist,"My job is to support students like you in exploring your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. We'll discuss ways to make positive changes in your life, but ultimately, the decisions are yours to make.",false
68,Client,Okay.,false
68,Therapist,Does that sound clear and comfortable for you?,false
68,Client,Yeah.,false
68,Therapist,"Great! To get started, can you tell me a bit about yourself? What are some things you enjoy doing or are passionate about?",false
68,Client,"Sure. I'm Andrea, and I'm a junior. I play the tenor sax in the marching band and also participate in other musical ensembles like wind ensemble and jazz band.",false
68,Therapist,That's really cool! It sounds like music plays a big role in your life.,false
68,Client,"Yeah, it does. I've been playing for about 10 years now, starting with violin and then exploring other instruments before finding the tenor sax.",false
68,Therapist,"Wow, that's impressive. What do you enjoy most about being part of these musical groups?",false
68,Client,"I think it's the sense of community and belonging. We all work together towards a common goal, and it feels great to be part of a team.",false
68,Therapist,That makes sense. It sounds like being part of a group gives you a sense of purpose and fulfillment.,false
68,Client,"Yeah, exactly.",false
68,Therapist,Can you tell me more about your family and what they're like?,false
68,Client,"Sure. I have an older brother who's about eight years older than me, and my parents are supportive. We also have a Golden Retriever named Max.",false
68,Therapist,That sounds lovely! How would you describe your relationships with your family members?,false
68,Client,"They're all pretty close-knit. My parents are always there for me, and my brother is more like a mentor to me.",false
68,Therapist,Okay. What about school? How's that going for you?,false
68,Client,"It's going well. I'm maintaining good grades, around 3.7 or so.",false
68,Therapist,Great job! What are your plans after high school?,false
68,Client,"I'd like to attend an Ivy League school and eventually become a doctor, possibly specializing in psychiatry.",false
68,Therapist,Those are ambitious goals! What motivates you to pursue this path?,false
68,Client,I think it's because I want to help people and make a positive impact on their lives.,false
68,Therapist,"That's admirable. Now, let's talk about your social life. What do you like to do with your friends?",false
68,Client,"We usually hang out at someone's house, play board games or watch movies, or sometimes go to the beach.",false
68,Therapist,Sounds like fun! Is there ever alcohol involved when you're hanging out with friends?,false
68,Client,"Yeah, sometimes.",false
68,Therapist,Can you tell me more about how alcohol fits into your social scene?,false
68,Client,It's mostly just for parties or special occasions. We'll have a few drinks to loosen up and have fun.,false
68,Therapist,Okay. How often do you think you drink?,false
68,Client,"I'd say about two weekends out of the month, maybe three.",false
68,Therapist,What's different about the days when you choose to drink versus not to drink?,false
68,Client,"When we drink, it's usually for parties or special events, and it's more energetic. When we don't drink, it's more relaxed and low-key.",false
68,Therapist,Okay. Can you tell me what you like about drinking or what benefits you get from it?,false
68,Client,I think it helps people relax and have fun together. We're all more carefree and can let loose.,false
68,Therapist,What are some of the not-so-good things about alcohol that you've experienced or seen in others?,false
68,Client,"Sometimes people make stupid decisions when they're drunk, and it can be bad for their health. I also don't like it when people get too sloppy or do things they shouldn't be doing.",false
68,Therapist,Okay. It sounds like you're trying to find a balance between having fun and being responsible.,false
68,Client,"Yeah, exactly.",false
68,Therapist,Can you tell me more about why you want to make changes to your drinking habits?,false
68,Client,I think it's because I value respect for myself and my body. I don't want to damage my health or do things that might hurt me in the long run.,false
68,Therapist,That makes sense. How important is it to you to work on this goal of reducing your drinking?,false
68,Client,"I'd say about a six or seven out of ten. I think it's important, but if I don't get around to it, I won't stress too much.",false
68,Therapist,Okay. Why do you say six or seven rather than a lower number?,false
68,Client,"Because I still think it's important to take care of my body and health, especially since I want to go to medical school.",false
68,Therapist,That's a good point. How confident are you that you could cut down on your drinking if you wanted to?,false
68,Client,"I'd say about a ten out of ten. If I make the decision to do it, I know I can stick to it.",false
68,Therapist,Great! Have you thought about how you might go about making these changes?,false
68,Client,"Yeah, I think I'll try to plan more activities that don't involve drinking and also be okay with not drinking when my friends are. Maybe we can find other ways to have fun together.",false
68,Therapist,That sounds like a good plan. Would it be okay if we met again in a few weeks to check in on your progress?,false
68,Client,"Yeah, that sounds great.",false
68,Therapist,Great! I'm looking forward to seeing you then and supporting you in reaching your goals.,false
71,Therapist,"It sounds like you have a clear vision for your future, including having a partner, a house, a nice car, and being a good dad to your kids. Can you tell me more about what that looks like?",false
71,Client,Yeah.,false
71,Therapist,I'm getting the sense that this dream is important to you. How does offending fit into this picture?,false
71,Client,I guess it doesn't.,false
71,Therapist,Can you help me understand how offending doesn't align with your goals?,false
71,Client,"Uh, I have to keep coming back here and going to court and stuff.",false
71,Therapist,That sounds like a real challenge. How do you think offending affects your ability to achieve your dreams?,false
71,Client,It kinda messes things up.,false
71,Therapist,In what way does it make things harder for you?,false
71,Client,"It makes it harder to get a job, I guess.",false
71,Therapist,Having a record can definitely make it tougher to find employment. We've talked about your passion for cars before. What have you been thinking about doing to pursue that interest?,false
71,Client,"Uh, I don't know if I would go into polytech or something.",false
71,Therapist,You're considering going back to school to get some training in the automotive field. What specifically draws you to that path?,false
71,Client,Just learn more about cars and have a hands-on job.,false
71,Therapist,"So, it's the practical aspect of working with cars that appeals to you. If you could have any job related to cars, what would it be?",false
71,Client,"[sighs] Mechanic, or panel beater, or just something with cars.",false
71,Therapist,"It sounds like as long as it involves cars, you'd be happy. What do you think you need to do to get started on that path?",false
71,Client,"Just get the training, I guess, and then probably get a job.",false
71,Therapist,That makes sense. You mentioned polytech earlier. Can you tell me more about what kind of training they offer?,false
71,Client,"Like, sort of, um, just at the polytech. I don't know what exactly it was, but—",false
71,Therapist,It sounds like you're interested in exploring your options for getting trained in the automotive field.,false
71,Client,Yeah.,false
71,Therapist,How confident are you that you could do something similar to what your friends have done?,false
71,Client,"Yeah. I could do it pretty easy. It's just, like, I probably know all this stuff already.",false
71,Therapist,You feel like you already have a good foundation in the subject matter. What do you need to do next to move forward with getting trained?,false
71,Client,"Like, well, I went out and picked some forms and stuff, but it's real confusing, like, having to apply, so I-I just couldn't—",false
71,Therapist,You've taken the first step by picking up the application forms. What specifically is giving you trouble with filling them out?,false
71,Client,The forms are too confusing.,false
71,Therapist,It sounds like the paperwork is a bit overwhelming for you. Who else could you ask to help you with that?,false
71,Client,No one. I guess you. You could do it. Would you do it?,false
71,Therapist,"Well, let's take a closer look at what's getting in the way of you filling out these forms.",false
71,Client,Yeah.,false
71,Therapist,It seems like this whole process is getting in the way of your bigger goal of getting trained and working with cars.,false
71,Client,Yeah.,false
71,Therapist,What do you think you can do between now and next week to move forward with the application?,false
71,Client,"I guess, I'd go pick them up and I don't know, I guess I could ask Donna, but she'd probably help me, I don't really want to.",false
71,Therapist,You're feeling a bit embarrassed about asking for help. What's holding you back from seeking assistance with the forms?,false
71,Client,"Well, I don't know if it's that serious, it's just—",false
71,Therapist,It sounds like there might be some underlying concerns or fears about asking for help.,false
71,Client,Yeah.,false
71,Therapist,Let's explore what's really getting in the way of you filling out these forms. Is it the writing itself or something else?,false
71,Client,"Of what? Well, I don't get it.",false
71,Therapist,It sounds like there might be some challenges with reading and writing that are contributing to your difficulties with the application.,false
71,Client,"Yeah. No, it does get in the way. I just don't wanna do it.",false
71,Therapist,You're feeling frustrated about having to deal with paperwork and forms.,false
71,Client,Yeah.,false
71,Therapist,How much reading and writing is involved in the course you're interested in?,false
71,Client,"I don't know. Hopefully, not many— not much, but that's what I wanna find out, I guess.",false
71,Therapist,You're hoping there won't be too much emphasis on reading and writing in the program.,false
71,Client,Yeah.,false
71,Therapist,What would it mean for you if you were more confident in your reading and writing abilities?,false
71,Client,It'd make everything easier.,false
71,Therapist,That sounds like a really positive outcome. Let's think about what we can do to support you in building those skills.,false
71,Client,Mm.,false
71,Therapist,"Before we move forward, let's take a step back and look at the bigger picture. What's the very first step you need to take to get started on this path?",false
71,Client,Mm.,false
80,Therapist,"Jean, it's great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?",false
80,Client,"Hello, doctor.",false
80,Therapist,What changes have you noticed in your smoking habits since we last spoke a week ago?,false
80,Client,"Well, I followed through on what we discussed and kept a journal for a week, trying to be more aware of when I had the urge to smoke and if I could resist it.",false
80,Therapist,That's a great start. Can you tell me more about your experience with the journal?,false
80,Client,"It was okay, but it got a bit challenging on the weekend because the urges kept coming up.",false
80,Therapist,"I understand that weekends can be tough. But during the week, you were able to cut down on smoking by two or three cigarettes. That's a significant accomplishment.",false
80,Client,"Yeah, and I'm proud of myself for being able to do that in just one week.",false
80,Therapist,"You should be proud! Cutting down by two or three cigarettes is a big deal, especially considering how much you were smoking before. Can you tell me more about what worked well for you during the week?",false
80,Client,Keeping the journal helped me focus on delaying my cigarettes and being more mindful of when I was reaching for one.,false
80,Therapist,"That's great to hear. Now, what didn't go as well as you had hoped? You mentioned that weekends were challenging.",false
80,Client,"Yeah, it seemed like the urges got worse when I was socializing with friends or had a lot of free time at home.",false
80,Therapist,It sounds like those situations triggered some automatic behaviors for you. Can you think of any ways to make those situations easier to manage?,false
80,Client,I've been thinking that maybe getting a hobby or joining a group on the weekends could help keep me busy and distracted from the urges.,false
80,Therapist,That's a great idea. Have you thought about what else might help you overcome these challenges?,false
80,Client,"If I can just postpone smoking when I get the urge, it seems to make it easier to manage. And maybe if I don't have cigarettes at home, that would help too.",false
80,Therapist,Those are both good strategies. What do you hope to work on between now and our next session?,false
80,Client,I'd like to continue keeping my journal and see if I can cut down even more. Maybe aim to reduce my smoking by another three cigarettes a day.,false
80,Therapist,That's a specific goal. What concrete steps can you take to make that happen?,false
80,Client,"I'll try to count my cigarettes each day and keep track of when I'm getting the urge to smoke. And maybe if I wait it out, the urge will pass before I give in.",false
80,Therapist,Those are good strategies. It's also clear that having someone to talk to about this has been helpful for you.,false
80,Client,"Yeah, coming back and talking to you really helps me stay on track.",false
80,Therapist,"Well, we'll schedule another appointment for next week then. How does that sound?",false
80,Client,"That sounds great, thank you doctor.",false
80,Therapist,"You're welcome, Jean. We'll see you in a week.",false
80,Client,"Yes, thank you.",false
86,Therapist,You're feeling overwhelmed and unsure of how to move forward.,false
86,Client,I just feel helpless about this whole deal.,false
86,Therapist,It sounds like you're struggling with a sense of hopelessness about your current situation.,false
86,Client,Mm. I just feel helpless about this whole deal.,false
86,Therapist,You seem to be at a loss for what steps to take next.,false
86,Client,No one wants to help me.,false
86,Therapist,You're feeling isolated and unsupported in your struggles.,false
86,Client,No one wants to help me.,false
86,Therapist,It sounds like you're experiencing feelings of loneliness and disconnection.,false
86,Client,Mm-hmm. I really shouldn't have done it.,false
86,Therapist,"You're reflecting on a decision that's causing you distress, and you wish things had gone differently.",false
86,Client,Mm-hmm. I really shouldn't have done it.,false
86,Therapist,It seems like you're grappling with regret about your actions.,false
86,Client,Mm-hmm. I couldn't help myself.,false
86,Therapist,"You felt a loss of control in that moment, and it's still affecting you now.",false
86,Client,I couldn't help myself.,false
86,Therapist,"You're acknowledging that your behaviors got the better of you, and that's causing concern for you.",false
86,Client,It's actually been a fabulous week.,false
86,Therapist,"Despite current challenges, you've had some positive experiences recently that are worth acknowledging.",false
86,Client,It's actually been a fabulous week.,false
86,Therapist,You seem to be taking pride in your recent successes and feeling more confident.,false
86,Client,"Mm-hmm. I know who to hang out with, I'm not stupid.",false
86,Therapist,You're recognizing your ability to make healthy choices and surround yourself with positive influences.,false
86,Client,"I know who to hang out with, I'm not stupid.",false
86,Therapist,It sounds like you've developed a sense of self-awareness about the company you keep and how it affects you.,false
86,Client,Mm-hmm. I'm letting the whole family down. They had such high hopes for me.,false
86,Therapist,"You're carrying a heavy burden of responsibility, feeling like you've fallen short of your family's expectations.",false
86,Client,Mm-hmm. I'm letting my whole family down. They had such high hopes for me.,false
86,Therapist,It seems like the weight of their disappointment is affecting your self-perception and motivation.,false
86,Client,Mm-hmm. This is not what I want for my life.,false
86,Therapist,You're recognizing a mismatch between your current circumstances and your long-term goals.,false
86,Client,This is not what I want for my life.,false
86,Therapist,It sounds like you're ready to take steps towards creating positive change in your life.,false
86,Client,Mm-hmm. I really want to get off the program.,false
86,Therapist,You're expressing a desire for autonomy and freedom from the current program.,false
86,Client,I really want to get off the program.,false
86,Therapist,It seems like you're motivated to take control of your life and make choices that align with your values.,false
86,Client,"Mm-hmm. I still crave smoking, even though I've stopped.",false
86,Therapist,"You're acknowledging the ongoing struggle with cravings, despite making progress in quitting.",false
86,Client,"I still crave smoking, even though I've stopped.",false
86,Therapist,It takes a lot of resilience and determination to resist those cravings and stay on track.,false
86,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
83,Therapist,"Kia ora, Rick. Welcome to our session today.",false
83,Client,Kia ora.,false
83,Therapist,"I've reviewed your file, and I see you're from a specific region in New Zealand. Can you tell me more about that?",false
83,Client,"Yeah, I'm from down south.",false
83,Therapist,That's a beautiful part of the country. What specifically drew you to Christchurch?,false
83,Client,I moved here when I was 18.,false
83,Therapist,"So, you've been living here for quite some time now. Do you have any family members who live in Christchurch as well?",false
83,Client,Just my own whānau.,false
83,Therapist,"As we begin our work together, I'm curious to know what thoughts were going through your mind on your way here today.",false
83,Client,I was thinking about what questions you might ask me and how I would respond. I was also thinking about my kids and having to take a day off work.,false
83,Therapist,It sounds like you're feeling a bit apprehensive about our session. Can you tell me more about that?,false
83,Client,"Yeah, it's just a bit of a hassle.",false
83,Therapist,I understand. You've had some experience with prevention services in the past. What was that like for you?,false
83,Client,"It was okay, but nothing really changed.",false
83,Therapist,"So, what brings you back to our service this time? Is there something specific that's motivated you to seek help again?",false
83,Client,"Yeah, I want to make some changes.",false
83,Therapist,That takes a lot of courage. What does it mean for you to take these steps towards change?,false
83,Client,I hope it means I can be a better person and make amends for past mistakes.,false
83,Therapist,Your children are clearly very important to you. Can you tell me more about your relationship with them?,false
83,Client,"Yeah, they're my whole world.",false
83,Therapist,It sounds like being a good father is crucial to you. What would it mean for you to be able to see your kids whenever you want?,false
83,Client,That would be everything to me.,false
83,Therapist,"On a scale of 1 to 100, how important is it for you to complete this program and make positive changes in your life?",false
83,Client,"It's 100%. If it means I can have my kids back in my life, I'll do whatever it takes.",false
83,Therapist,That's a powerful commitment. What do you think it would be like for your kids if they heard you say that this program is really important to you and to them?,false
83,Client,I hope they'd be proud of me.,false
83,Therapist,Is there anyone else in your family who would be supportive of the changes you're trying to make?,false
83,Client,"My mom, definitely. She's always been there for me.",false
83,Therapist,That's great. What do you think it would mean for her if she knew you were taking these steps towards change?,false
83,Client,I think she'd be proud of me too.,false
83,Therapist,"As we work together, I want to make sure you have a support system in place. Who else can we involve to help you stay on track with this program?",false
83,Client,"Um, I'm not sure. I don't have many people I trust.",false
83,Therapist,"That's okay. We'll explore that further as we go along. For now, let's focus on your commitment to this program and the changes you want to make.",false
83,Client,"Yeah, I'm committed.",false
83,Therapist,"Great. Before we end our session today, I just want to check in with you about how you're feeling. Are there any concerns or doubts that have come up for you?",false
83,Client,"No, I feel okay. Just a bit overwhelmed, but I'll get through it.",false
83,Therapist,That's completely understandable. We'll take things one step at a time.,false
95,Therapist,"Hi Ruth, thank you for coming in today. How are you feeling right now?",false
95,Client,I'm just really struggling. I feel like I've lost my way and I don't know why I'm even here. I'm so frustrated with myself.,false
95,Therapist,It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed and stuck. Can you tell me more about what's been going on that's making you feel this way?,false
95,Client,"Yeah...I just keep doing the same things over and over, even though I know they're not good for me. I feel like I've lost all my willpower.",false
95,Therapist,It takes a lot of courage to admit when we're struggling. Can you help me understand what's driving these feelings of frustration and hopelessness?,false
95,Client,Mm-hmm...I just feel like cutting myself is the only way to cope with everything that's going on inside me.,false
95,Therapist,"I'm so sorry to hear that you're feeling this way, Ruth. It sounds like you're in a lot of emotional pain right now.",false
95,Client,Yeah...sometimes physical pain feels easier to deal with than the pain inside me.,false
95,Therapist,That makes sense. Sometimes our bodies can feel overwhelmed by our emotions. Can you tell me more about what's going on at home that might be contributing to these feelings?,false
95,Client,"My mom is a single parent and she struggles a lot. I want to help her, but I don't know how.",false
95,Therapist,"It sounds like you're feeling a sense of responsibility for your mom's well-being, and that can be really tough.",false
95,Client,"Yeah...I feel like if I wasn't around anymore, she would be okay. She wouldn't have to worry about me or pay my bills.",false
95,Therapist,That must be a really hard feeling to carry around. Can you help me understand why you think your mom would be better off without you?,false
95,Client,Because I'm just another burden for her to deal with.,false
95,Therapist,I see. It sounds like you're feeling like a weight on your mom's shoulders. But what about all the ways you are helping her right now? How do you contribute to your household?,false
95,Client,"Um...I try to be a good kid, I go to school, and I don't have failing grades.",false
95,Therapist,"That's great! It sounds like you're making an effort to help out in any way you can. And by coming here today and talking to me about all this, you're showing that you care about yourself and your mom.",false
95,Client,Yeah...I guess so.,false
95,Therapist,"Ruth, it takes a lot of courage to admit when we need help. I'm proud of you for taking this step. Now, let's talk about some ways we can work together to find healthier coping mechanisms for you.",false
95,Client,Um...I don't know if I can do that.,false
95,Therapist,"That's okay, Ruth. We'll take it one step at a time. You've already taken a huge step by coming here today and opening up to me. Let's build on that.",false
95,Client,"Thank you, ma'am. I feel a little better now.",false
95,Therapist,"You're welcome, Ruth. Thank you for trusting me with your story today.",false
95,Client,Okay.,false
98,Therapist,"So, let's go back to the mailbox incident. What happened there?",false
98,Client,"I was driving home from a party and accidentally drove onto my neighbor's lawn, hitting their mailbox.",false
98,Therapist,That must have been frightening.,false
98,Client,"To be honest, I don't remember much of that night.",false
98,Therapist,Was it a blackout or just a fuzzy memory?,false
98,Client,I'm not sure. I just don't recall how it happened.,false
98,Therapist,"Sorry for assuming it was a blackout. After the mailbox incident, you stopped drinking for six months and tried to work things out with your girlfriend Mary.",false
98,Client,"Yeah, but it didn't work out. She became too possessive, and I felt controlled.",false
98,Therapist,No one likes being controlled. Did you feel like your friends were controlling you when they gave you those extra shots?,false
98,Client,"No, they weren't trying to control me. They just shouldn't have given me more drinks when they knew I was already intoxicated.",false
98,Therapist,That's true. And then they let you drive home.,false
98,Client,"Yeah, that wasn't a good idea.",false
98,Therapist,"Looking back, what would you do differently now?",false
98,Client,I'd think twice about drinking so much and make sure to have a safe ride home.,false
98,Therapist,Is there someone you could call for a ride?,false
98,Client,I guess I could call a taxi or something.,false
98,Therapist,That's a good plan. You mentioned having friends over for the Super Bowl. Would you be concerned about them drinking and driving?,false
98,Client,"Not really, they're not heavy drinkers. But if I'm being honest, I don't think about it that much.",false
98,Therapist,What was it like when you stopped drinking for six months?,false
98,Client,"It was good physically, but I felt isolated and bored. I didn't have my friends around, and my relationship with Mary wasn't working out.",false
98,Therapist,"If you were to stop drinking again, do you think your relationships with your friends would change?",false
98,Client,"Yeah, it might be uncomfortable. They'd probably tease me for not drinking.",false
98,Therapist,How important is it for you to remain friends with them and stay sober?,false
98,Client,"It's pretty important. I value our friendship, but maybe taking a break from them would be a good idea.",false
98,Therapist,"On a scale of 0-10, how important is it for you to stop hanging out with them to get your license back?",false
98,Client,Probably an 8 or 9. I need to make some changes to get my life back on track.,false
98,Therapist,We can discuss this further next time if you'd like.,false
98,Client,"Yeah, that sounds good.",false
98,Therapist,The plans we've discussed might help you get your license back. It's ultimately up to you to follow through.,false
98,Client,"Okay, got it.",false
104,Therapist,"Before we conclude, may I review the questionnaire you completed prior to our visit?",false
104,Client,Okay.,false
104,Therapist,"Thank you. I want to assure you that my role in discussing alcohol and drugs is to provide information and explore your thoughts and goals, if any. Is that clear?",false
104,Client,Yeah.,false
104,Therapist,Great. You indicated using alcohol on at least eight days in the past year. Can you estimate the actual number of days?,false
104,Client,"Somewhere around eight days, but I'm not certain.",false
104,Therapist,How would you describe your drinking patterns?,false
104,Client,"I mostly drink at parties and social gatherings, rarely at home.",false
104,Therapist,What types of alcoholic beverages do you typically consume at parties?,false
104,Client,"Usually liquor-based drinks, like vodka or gin mixed with juice, and occasionally beer, although I'm not a big fan of beer.",false
104,Therapist,Can you estimate how many drinks you usually have during a party?,false
104,Client,Over the entire time I'm there? Probably four or five drinks.,false
104,Therapist,You checked that drinking helps you feel relaxed and more at ease. Is that accurate?,false
104,Client,"Yeah, it makes me feel more relaxed.",false
104,Therapist,You also mentioned sometimes forgetting things when you drink. What kind of things do you forget?,false
104,Client,"Um, I forget how many drinks I've had or whose house I'm at.",false
104,Therapist,It sounds like you experience memory lapses when drinking.,false
104,Client,Right.,false
104,Therapist,"As part of our discussion, I'd like to share some information with you. The safest level of drinking for teenagers is zero drinks due to the potential risks associated with adolescent brain development and increased likelihood of accidents, sexual assault, and STDs. Do you think your drinking might be related to the risk of contracting an STD?",false
104,Client,"Um, yeah. I was drinking during my last sexual encounter, and we didn't use protection.",false
104,Therapist,Did you feel like you gave consent for that encounter?,false
104,Client,"Yeah, we've had sex before with a condom, but not this time.",false
104,Therapist,How do you think drinking affected your decision to use protection?,false
104,Client,We just didn't stop to put one on. We weren't thinking about it.,false
104,Therapist,It sounds like drinking can impair your judgment in those moments.,false
104,Client,"Yeah, I would've definitely told him to use a condom if I were sober.",false
104,Therapist,There's another important point to consider. Forgetting where you are or how many drinks you've had can be signs of heavy drinking. And continuing to drink despite negative consequences might indicate an alcohol use disorder.,false
104,Client,"Well, that's not me. I don't need help from anyone.",false
104,Therapist,What do you enjoy about drinking?,false
104,Client,"Um, it's fun. I like drinking with friends and laughing together.",false
104,Therapist,What are some things you dislike about your drinking habits?,false
104,Client,"Um, I don't like forgetting where I am or putting myself at risk for STDs.",false
104,Therapist,"So, on one hand, you enjoy the social aspect of drinking, but on the other hand, you're concerned about the negative consequences.",false
104,Client,Yeah.,false
104,Therapist,"Considering your thoughts and feelings, what changes would you like to make regarding your drinking?",false
104,Client,"Well, I definitely don't want to drink too much again.",false
104,Therapist,"How ready are you to make that change? On a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 being completely ready, where do you stand?",false
104,Client,"Um, a nine.",false
104,Therapist,You seem very motivated. What led you to choose such a high number?,false
104,Client,"Well, I really don't want any STDs and the uncertainty is unsettling.",false
104,Therapist,That's understandable. What plan can you develop to achieve your goal of not drinking too much?,false
104,Client,"Um, well, I'll count my drinks and stop at two, and also stop drinking when I start feeling drunk.",false
104,Therapist,Great strategy. Who could support you in reaching this goal?,false
104,Client,My friend who's concerned about my drinking might be willing to help me stick to my plan.,false
104,Therapist,That's a good idea. What about unprotected sex? You mentioned wanting to avoid that situation again.,false
104,Client,"I'll talk to him and make sure we always use protection, even when drinking.",false
104,Therapist,Excellent plan. It sounds like you're highly motivated to change your behavior. Would you be willing to follow up with me in six weeks or so?,false
104,Client,Okay.,false
104,Therapist,Great. Thank you for sharing your thoughts and feelings with me today. I look forward to our next meeting.,false
104,Client,"",false
113,Therapist,"Hi Sandra, I appreciate you taking a few minutes to talk with me today.",false
113,Client,Hi.,false
113,Therapist,"I understand your time is limited, especially with your daughter in the hospital. What motivated you to come in and discuss your smoking habits?",false
113,Client,"Well, my daughter's hospitalization made me realize it's essential to quit smoking, but I enjoy it and don't feel ready to give it up yet. My life is too chaotic right now.",false
113,Therapist,"It sounds like there are some concerns on your mind, but coming in here wasn't necessarily a priority for you today. What led you to make time for this conversation?",false
113,Client,"I think it's crucial because I'm a bad role model for my children, and with my daughter turning 12, some of her friends have already tried smoking. I don't want her to think it's acceptable.",false
113,Therapist,You're worried about influencing your daughter negatively by smoking.,false
113,Client,"Exactly. I started smoking young, and I wouldn't want that for her.",false
113,Therapist,"It seems like setting a good example is important to you, but quitting smoking feels daunting right now.",false
113,Client,That's true. It feels overwhelming.,false
113,Therapist,What are some things you enjoy about smoking?,false
113,Client,"It's enjoyable, relaxing, and helps me cope with stress. At work, we often take breaks together to smoke and chat. I'd feel left out if I quit.",false
113,Therapist,Can you think of anything else that makes smoking appealing to you?,false
113,Client,"Hmm...I like having a cigarette after meals; it signals to my brain that I'm done eating. Sometimes, I'll have a cigarette instead of a snack to control my weight.",false
113,Therapist,Is there anything else you'd like to add about what you enjoy about smoking?,false
113,Client,"Let me think...I just genuinely enjoy it, despite knowing it's not good for me.",false
113,Therapist,I want to make sure I understand all the reasons you're attached to smoking. Have I missed anything?,false
113,Client,Okay.,false
113,Therapist,"It sounds like smoking is a way for you to relax, socialize with coworkers, and manage your weight. You also mentioned it's hard to imagine life without smoking.",false
113,Client,That's true.,false
113,Therapist,You've also shared that smoking after meals is pleasurable and something you'd struggle to give up.,false
113,Client,Yeah.,false
113,Therapist,"I sense that smoking has been a significant part of your life for a long time, making it difficult to envision yourself as a non-smoker. Does that capture the essence of what's keeping you smoking?",false
113,Client,Exactly.,false
113,Therapist,"Now, let's explore the other side. What are some not-so-good things about smoking that concern you?",false
113,Client,"Well, I worry about my children and feel like I'm being a bad parent. My daughter's already seen me smoke for years, and I don't want her to start smoking.",false
113,Therapist,Can you recall a specific instance where you felt like you set a bad example for your daughter by smoking?,false
113,Client,"Yeah...this morning, I was outside having a cigarette, and when I looked up, she was watching me from the window.",false
113,Therapist,How did that make you feel when you saw her watching you smoke?,false
113,Client,"Terrible. I want to be a good parent, but this behavior doesn't align with that goal.",false
113,Therapist,"It's clear that being a good role model is essential to you, yet smoking seems important for stress relief and socializing. How do these two conflicting priorities coexist for you?",false
113,Client,They don't fit together; it's like two opposing sides of the same coin.,false
113,Therapist,What would need to happen for quitting or changing your smoking habits to become a higher priority for you?,false
113,Client,I'm not sure right now.,false
113,Therapist,"Okay. It sounds like you're open to exploring this further, but don't have a clear plan yet.",false
113,Client,Exactly.,false
113,Therapist,We've used up most of our time today. Would you be willing to schedule another appointment and continue discussing your smoking habits?,false
113,Client,"Oh, sure. I'll come in next week.",false
113,Therapist,"Great. Before we meet again, I'd like to ask you to do a small exercise. Can you write down your top three reasons for considering quitting smoking and reflect on the good and not-so-good things about continuing or quitting smoking?",false
113,Client,"Okay, okay, I'll give it a try.",false
113,Therapist,"Thank you, Sandra. We'll see you next week.",false
113,Client,All right.,false
119,Therapist,Welcome back. Can you tell me about any significant events that have occurred since our last meeting?,false
119,Client,"I did get an interview for a job, but unfortunately, I had to cancel it because I couldn't find childcare.",false
119,Therapist,That sounds like a really tough spot to be in.,false
119,Client,"Yeah, it's frustrating because the job seemed promising, but I didn't have a choice. My kids come first, and I'm worried this will keep happening.",false
119,Therapist,It sounds like you're feeling stuck between taking care of your children and pursuing job opportunities.,false
119,Client,Exactly. I feel like I'm being held back by my responsibilities as a parent.,false
119,Therapist,"On a scale from one to 10, how important is it for you to get a job right now?",false
119,Client,"It's a 10. As the sole provider for my kids, I need a steady income to support them, and what I'm getting from welfare isn't enough.",false
119,Therapist,You're shouldering a lot of responsibility as a single parent.,false
119,Client,"Yeah, it's just me providing for my children.",false
119,Therapist,"And on a scale from one to 10, how confident do you feel about your ability to get a job?",false
119,Client,"Honestly, I'm around a three. My resume isn't impressive, and I don't have much education or experience compared to others in the same field.",false
119,Therapist,It sounds like you're struggling with feelings of inadequacy when it comes to your qualifications.,false
119,Client,"Yeah, my lack of education and experience makes me feel like I'm not employable.",false
119,Therapist,What would make a job appealing to you?,false
119,Client,Something steady that allows me to spend time with my kids in the evenings and provides financial stability.,false
119,Therapist,Having consistent work would significantly improve your life.,false
119,Client,"Yeah, it would be huge. I'd have a routine, know what I'm doing each day, and not worry about money all the time.",false
119,Therapist,What would it take for you to feel more confident in your ability to get a job?,false
119,Client,Being able to attend interviews without worrying about childcare would be a big step.,false
119,Therapist,Having reliable childcare would definitely help.,false
119,Client,"Yeah, that's my top priority right now.",false
119,Therapist,What else could boost your confidence?,false
119,Client,"If I had more education or training, especially in areas like computer skills, which seem to be in demand.",false
119,Therapist,Having a certification or training in a specific field could give you something to talk about with confidence during interviews.,false
119,Client,"Yeah, that would make a big difference. Even if it's not my dream job, having some immediate skills would get me into the workforce and allow me to focus on long-term goals later.",false
119,Therapist,You're looking for something that can provide stability and financial security in the short term.,false
119,Client,Exactly. Something that pays well and allows me to take care of my kids.,false
119,Therapist,"It sounds like getting a job is crucial for you right now, and you have some ideas about how to move forward.",false
119,Client,"Yeah, finding childcare resources and getting into a training program are my top priorities.",false
119,Therapist,What do you think your next steps should be?,false
119,Client,Finding reliable childcare and exploring short-term training programs that can give me immediate skills.,false
116,Therapist,"Molly, I appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today. Your mom had shared some concerns about difficulties you've been facing at school.",false
116,Client,Yeah.,false
116,Therapist,It sounds like there have been some issues with bullying and rumors spreading about you. Can you tell me more about what's been going on?,false
116,Client,"I've stayed home from school a couple of times because of the bullying, and even when I'm not there, rumors keep circulating.",false
116,Therapist,That must be really tough for you to deal with. It sounds like people are making up stories about you.,false
116,Client,"Yeah, it's been happening since fifth or sixth grade. I think it's because I tend to engage with people who are talking about me, and that makes me an easy target.",false
116,Therapist,"So, when you say you ""nag on things,"" can you give me an example of what you mean by that?",false
116,Client,"If someone says something about me, I'll ask them questions and keep talking, which usually makes the situation worse.",false
116,Therapist,And what happens when you don't walk away from those situations? What's the outcome?,false
116,Client,"It usually escalates, and we both end up getting in trouble.",false
116,Therapist,"Okay. So, it sounds like you're aware of how your actions can contribute to these situations. Can you tell me more about what goes through your mind when you decide not to engage with someone who's trying to provoke you?",false
116,Client,I try to think about my mom and how she would feel if I got in trouble again. That helps me calm down and walk away.,false
116,Therapist,That's a great strategy. It sounds like you're developing some self-awareness and learning to manage your emotions.,false
116,Client,"Yeah, it's helping me make better choices.",false
116,Therapist,"So, what do you think are some key characteristics of friends who have your back and support you?",false
116,Client,"I think they're the ones who hang out with me regularly, text me, and call me. They're also people who trust me with their secrets and know I'll keep them confidential.",false
116,Therapist,That makes sense. It sounds like you value loyalty and trust in your friendships.,false
116,Client,"Yeah, those are important to me.",false
116,Therapist,"Okay, Molly. It sounds like we've covered a lot of ground today. Would you be open to continuing our conversation another time?",false
116,Client,"Yeah, that would be great.",false
116,Therapist,"And if you'd like, I'm also happy to meet with some of your friends who might be struggling with similar issues.",false
116,Client,"Actually, there is one friend who might appreciate talking to someone.",false
116,Therapist,"Okay, we can definitely explore that option. But for now, let's focus on supporting you and helping you develop strategies to deal with these challenging situations.",false
116,Client,Sounds good to me.,false
116,Therapist,"Great. I think you're doing a great job of navigating high school, Molly. It's not always easy, but it sounds like you're finding ways to cope and connect with positive people.",false
116,Client,Thanks.,false
122,Therapist,I sense some reluctance about being here. Can you tell me more about what brings you to this session?,false
122,Client,"Honestly, my mom wants me to be here, but I'm not really sure I want to be.",false
122,Therapist,You're feeling a bit uncertain about your presence here.,false
122,Client,"Yeah, I don't really see the point, but whatever.",false
122,Therapist,It sounds like you're feeling a bit ambivalent. Can you tell me more about what happened with your mom?,false
122,Client,She found my stash and freaked out. I don't know why she was going through my stuff in the first place.,false
122,Therapist,That must have been really upsetting for you.,false
122,Client,"Yeah, it was. And now I'm here because of it.",false
122,Therapist,You've also mentioned a new group of friends that you're enjoying spending time with. Can you tell me more about them?,false
122,Client,"Yeah, they're really cool people and I like hanging out with them.",false
122,Therapist,It sounds like you're feeling pretty positive about this new social connection.,false
122,Client,"Yeah, I am.",false
122,Therapist,"So, just to summarize, it seems like things were going okay for you until your mom found your stash and now we're here. Is that a fair summary?",false
122,Client,"Yeah, basically.",false
122,Therapist,And it sounds like you're feeling pretty upset with your mom about her actions.,false
122,Client,"I am. It's my stuff, and I don't see why she needed to go through it.",false
122,Therapist,You feel like your personal space was invaded.,false
122,Client,"Exactly! I wouldn't go through her stuff, so why did she need to go through mine?",false
122,Therapist,That makes sense. It sounds like you're feeling a bit disrespected by her actions.,false
122,Client,"Yeah, that's exactly how I feel.",false
122,Therapist,And it seems like you're wondering why the rules don't apply both ways?,false
122,Client,Right! Why can she go through my stuff but I'm not allowed to touch hers?,false
131,Therapist,Good morning. I appreciate you taking the time to come in and discuss your goals for quitting smoking.,false
131,Client,Good morning.,false
131,Therapist,What are your expectations from our conversation today?,false
131,Client,"Well, I'm hoping to get some medication to help me quit.",false
131,Therapist,We can definitely explore that option. What else do you think might be helpful in supporting your goal to stop smoking?,false
131,Client,Just anything that can make it easier for me to stay smoke-free.,false
131,Therapist,Okay. Can you remind me what motivated you to want to quit smoking at this time?,false
131,Client,"I've been smoking 20-30 cigarettes a day, and I'm just tired of it. My friends have all quit, and I feel like I'm the only one left who still smokes.",false
131,Therapist,"It sounds like you're feeling a bit self-conscious about your smoking habit, especially around your friends.",false
131,Client,"Yeah, especially when we go out to restaurants and I'm the only one stepping outside to smoke. It's embarrassing.",false
131,Therapist,"That can be an uncomfortable experience. So, it seems like one of the reasons you want to quit is because of the social stigma and embarrassment associated with smoking.",false
131,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
131,Therapist,Are there any other reasons why you'd like to stop smoking?,false
131,Client,"Yeah, it's expensive. I spend about £7 a day on cigarettes.",false
131,Therapist,"That adds up quickly. So, we're talking about a weekly expense of around £50.",false
131,Client,"Yeah, that's right.",false
131,Therapist,"Okay. So, we have three reasons why you'd like to quit smoking: the social stigma, the cost, and your personal dislike of the smell. Do you think these reasons are enough to motivate you to stay on track?",false
131,Client,Yeah.,false
131,Therapist,Great. Have you thought about a specific date when you'd like to stop smoking?,false
131,Client,What do you suggest?,false
131,Therapist,"Generally, it's best to choose a time when you're not experiencing too much stress or pressure in other areas of your life.",false
131,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
131,Therapist,Can you tell me more about what you enjoy most about smoking? Is there something specific that you'll miss about the experience?,false
131,Client,It's just something I do when I'm bored or need a break. Sometimes it helps me relax.,false
131,Therapist,Okay. What do you think you'll miss most about smoking?,false
131,Client,The way it helps me calm down and take a break from stress.,false
131,Therapist,"Mm-hmm. Can you tell me more about the stresses that you experience, especially at work?",false
131,Client,"Yeah, just feeling overwhelmed and needing to step away for a bit.",false
131,Therapist,Okay. And what's your favorite time of day to smoke?,false
131,Client,"Definitely after work, when I'm unwinding.",false
131,Therapist,"Okay. So, it sounds like smoking is closely tied to your relaxation routine. After you quit, how do you plan to manage those moments when you'd normally reach for a cigarette?",false
131,Client,I guess I'll just take some fresh air and try to give myself regular breaks instead.,false
131,Therapist,Okay. Have you ever managed to stop smoking in the past?,false
131,Client,"Yeah, for a couple of weeks.",false
131,Therapist,What triggered your return to smoking?,false
131,Client,It was stress from an argument with my partner.,false
131,Therapist,"So, it sounds like stress can be a major trigger for you. Let me make sure I understand what we've discussed so far. You want to stop smoking because of the social stigma, cost, and personal dislike of the smell...",false
131,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
131,Therapist,...and you're looking for ways to manage your stress and cravings without relying on cigarettes.,false
131,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
131,Therapist,We've discussed using medication to help with cravings. Are you interested in exploring that option further?,false
131,Client,"Yeah, I think a patch might be helpful.",false
131,Therapist,Okay. And would you like to use something else in addition to the patch to help manage any cravings or irritability?,false
131,Client,"Yeah, that sounds good.",false
131,Therapist,Great. We can discuss some options for that. What does it feel like when you're craving a cigarette and can't have one?,false
131,Client,I just get irritable.,false
131,Therapist,"Okay. That's exactly what we're trying to prevent with the medication. So, I'd recommend using the patch and another product to help manage those feelings of irritation.",false
131,Client,Okay.,false
131,Therapist,Are you happy with our plan for your quit date?,false
131,Client,"Yeah, absolutely.",false
131,Therapist,And would you like to schedule a follow-up appointment to check in on your progress?,false
131,Client,Definitely.,false
131,Therapist,"Great. If you don't come back, how would you like me to reach out to you?",false
131,Client,A phone call would be great.,false
131,Therapist,Sounds good.,false
125,Therapist,It sounds like you've had a really tough night with the baby being up frequently?,false
125,Client,The baby was up all night and I'm completely exhausted.,false
125,Therapist,"Just to make sure I understand, you're feeling overwhelmed by the lack of sleep and wondering what's going on with her feeding schedule?",false
125,Client,"Yes. She was up every three hours to eat, I don't understand it.",false
125,Therapist,It sounds like that frequency is really challenging for you - can you tell me more about what's frustrating you about this pattern?,false
125,Client,"Yes. My mom told me that I started sleeping through the night when I was a month old, Lilly is six weeks.",false
125,Therapist,"I sense that you might be comparing Lilly's development to your own, and wondering if there's something different or unusual going on here - am I right in picking up on that?",false
125,Client,"Well, what is normal for a baby this age?",false
