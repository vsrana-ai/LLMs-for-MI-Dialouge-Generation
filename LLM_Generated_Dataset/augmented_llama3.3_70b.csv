3,Therapist,"It sounds like you're feeling a bit uncertain about your wife's concerns regarding your health habits, and you're not entirely sure what the issue is.",false
3,Client,"My wife has been getting on my case lately about improving my health, but I don't really see the problem. I've been working hard and sometimes have to grab dinner at places like Applebee's, so I'm not sure why she's making such a big deal out of it.",false
3,Therapist,"Just to make sure I understand, you're saying that you don't feel like your health is a major concern for you right now?",false
3,Client,"I feel fine, physically.",false
3,Therapist,"Okay, got it.",false
3,Client,"My job involves a lot of manual labor and I'm often working outside in the heat, so I figure I'm sweating out any unhealthy things I might be putting into my body.",false
3,Therapist,Have you noticed any changes in your weight or overall physical condition lately?,false
3,Client,"A little weight gain, but nothing too significant - I don't feel bloated or anything out of the ordinary.",false
3,Therapist,Okay. And when was the last time you had a check-up with your doctor?,false
3,Client,"I had a physical about a year ago, and everything seemed to be okay.",false
3,Therapist,"So, it sounds like you're feeling pretty good overall?",false
3,Client,"Yeah, that's right.",false
3,Therapist,It seems like you think your wife might be worrying more about this than she needs to - is that a fair statement?,false
3,Client,"I don't think she's overreacting, exactly - I know she wants me to be healthy and live a long life. But sometimes, after a hard day of work, grabbing dinner at a place like Applebee's can be a nice pick-me-up.",false
3,Therapist,"That makes sense. Would you be open to learning more about health topics like obesity or diabetes, just to have a better understanding?",false
3,Client,"Sure, that sounds okay with me.",false
6,Therapist,"Hello Sal, I appreciate you taking the time to come in today.",false
6,Client,"No problem, thanks for having me.",false
6,Therapist,"I understand your doctor referred you, and I'm glad you're here to explore some concerns together.",false
6,Client,"Yeah, it's a bit of an inconvenience, but I'm here now.",false
6,Therapist,"You've made the effort to be here, and I'd like to understand what brings you to this point.",false
6,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
6,Therapist,Can you help me understand what your doctor's concerns were that led to this referral?,false
6,Client,"I think it's about making more changes in my life, like quitting smoking, cutting down on drinking, and maybe even getting rid of my dog.",false
6,Therapist,"So there are multiple factors at play, not just your asthma, but also other aspects of your life.",false
6,Client,"Yeah, there's a lot of stress too, with my wife on maternity leave and me being the sole breadwinner right now.",false
6,Therapist,It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed by all these responsibilities and changes.,false
6,Client,"Yeah, it's a lot to handle.",false
6,Therapist,Almost feels like too much to manage at times.,false
6,Client,"Yeah, it is overwhelming.",false
6,Therapist,"Given our time together today, would you be open to exploring some of these challenges and identifying what might be the most helpful to focus on?",false
6,Client,"Yeah, everything feels chaotic, but I guess we have to start somewhere.",false
6,Therapist,"Okay, one tool we can use is an agenda-setting worksheet to help clarify things.",false
6,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
6,Therapist,"If you were to list all the changes that others are suggesting you make, what would be on that list? Remember, just because we write them down doesn't mean you have to act on them.",false
6,Client,"Okay, that sounds okay, as long as it's just about listing things and not necessarily making changes.",false
6,Therapist,"You're in control here, and this is just a way to get everything out in the open.",false
6,Client,"Alright, that makes sense.",false
6,Therapist,"So, what are some of those things that others are suggesting you change?",false
6,Client,"Okay, well, my asthma is one.",false
6,Therapist,Asthma is on the list. What else?,false
6,Client,"And then there's my dog, Oscar, which they want me to get rid of.",false
6,Therapist,"Your dog, and the concern is that he's contributing to your asthma.",false
6,Client,"Yeah, but I'm not sure I agree with that, and I don't know if I can just get rid of him.",false
6,Therapist,Being told to give up your dog must be very difficult for you.,false
6,Client,"Yeah, he's been with me longer than my wife, so it's like losing a best friend.",false
6,Therapist,That's a significant stress for you right now.,false
6,Client,"Yeah, it's a big deal.",false
6,Therapist,"You're also working on quitting smoking completely, is that right?",false
6,Client,"Yeah, cutting down on cigarettes is something I've been trying to do.",false
6,Therapist,Financial struggles are another challenge for you currently.,false
6,Client,"Yes, and time management, with all these appointments and taking time off work, which affects our finances.",false
6,Therapist,"So, appointments and the impact on your work and finances are interconnected issues.",false
6,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
6,Therapist,It seems like some of these challenges are related. Is there anything else that's concerning you?,false
6,Client,"No, it just feels overwhelming when I see everything listed out.",false
6,Therapist,"If you had to prioritize one or two things to focus on during our time today, what would they be?",false
6,Client,I think the situation with my dog and my asthma are the most pressing issues for me.,false
6,Therapist,Those two issues seem closely related.,false
6,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
12,Therapist,"Sarah, I appreciate you taking the time to come in for your well-woman exam today. We've addressed several of your concerns, and now I'd like to explore your smoking habits further if that's okay with you?",false
12,Client,"Yeah, that's fine.",false
12,Therapist,Can you tell me more about your daily smoking routine? You mentioned it had increased from once or twice a day.,false
12,Client,"Usually, I smoke in the morning, once during my lunch break, and then around five or six times in the evening.",false
12,Therapist,"So, approximately eight cigarettes a day, which is just under half a pack?",false
12,Client,"Yeah, that sounds right.",false
12,Therapist,And how has your smoking changed over time?,false
12,Client,"Honestly, I've been smoking more over the past year or so.",false
12,Therapist,"So, there's been an increase in your smoking over the past year, mainly in the evenings?",false
12,Client,"Yes, because I try not to smoke around my two-year-old son, so I wait until he's asleep.",false
12,Therapist,It sounds like the evening is a time for you to unwind and relax.,false
12,Client,"Exactly, with my crazy schedule, working full-time and attending night classes, the evening is my time to myself.",false
12,Therapist,"That makes sense. You have a lot on your plate, and it's essential to have some downtime. What else do you do in the evenings to relax?",false
12,Client,Sometimes I'll have a drink or two.,false
12,Therapist,"Okay, so about how many drinks would you say you have in a day?",false
12,Client,Maybe two at most.,false
12,Therapist,"And over the course of a week, approximately how many drinks would you estimate?",false
12,Client,"I'm not sure why you're asking me this; I just came in for a regular visit, not to discuss my drinking habits.",false
12,Therapist,"I understand your concerns, Sarah. Please know that I'm here to listen and provide information, not to dictate what you should or shouldn't do. As your healthcare provider, my goal is to ensure you have all the necessary resources to meet your goals, including maintaining good health. Would it be okay if we discussed some healthcare concerns related to smoking and alcohol?",false
12,Client,"Yeah, I guess that's fine.",false
12,Therapist,"We know that increased smoking and alcohol consumption are associated with various health risks, such as certain types of cancer, liver and lung disease, heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension. I'm interested in hearing your thoughts on this.",false
12,Client,"Yeah, that's a lot to take in.",false
12,Therapist,Can you share your thoughts on this information?,false
12,Client,"Honestly, I'm surprised because I don't think I smoke or drink that much compared to others, and I've been trying to keep it under control.",false
12,Therapist,"So, you're making a conscious effort to cut back.",false
12,Client,"Yes, I am.",false
12,Therapist,"On a scale from 0 to 10, with 0 being not ready to stop smoking at all and 10 being absolutely ready, where would you say you are?",false
12,Client,Maybe around a five.,false
12,Therapist,You've chosen a five. What led you to that decision rather than a four?,false
12,Client,"Well, hearing about the potential health risks, especially as a mother, I don't want anything to happen to me.",false
12,Therapist,"That's understandable. Given these concerns and your desire to prioritize your family's well-being, what steps might you consider taking to move closer to quitting smoking?",false
12,Client,Maybe I could try to cut back on evening smoking.,false
12,Therapist,Let's quantify that. How many cigarettes do you think you could reduce your evening smoking by?,false
12,Client,"If I'm having five or six now, maybe I could smoke three in the evening and still have a couple during the day.",false
12,Therapist,"That's a significant reduction. Since our time is running out, would you be willing to come back in four weeks to review your progress?",false
12,Client,"Yeah, that sounds good.",false
12,Therapist,We can also go over your lab results at that time. Would you like some information on smoking cessation resources?,false
12,Client,"Yes, that would be helpful.",false
12,Therapist,"I have a brochure here with some useful techniques for managing nicotine cravings. Additionally, I'd like to offer you the opportunity to speak with one of our counselors, Dr. Kirtley, who specializes in discussing the relationship between alcohol and stress.",false
12,Client,What would that entail exactly?,false
12,Therapist,"Dr. Kirtley can help you explore how stress might be impacting your drinking habits. According to national guidelines, it's recommended that women limit their weekly alcohol intake to seven drinks or less to minimize health risks. Your current consumption is slightly higher than that, putting you at risk.",false
12,Client,I see.,false
12,Therapist,"You've expressed interest in discussing stress management, and I think Dr. Kirtley could be a great resource for you. Before you leave today, we'll schedule appointments for you to see me again in four weeks and to meet with Dr. Kirtley. Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up?",false
12,Client,"No, I don't think so.",false
12,Therapist,"It was nice meeting you, Sarah. I'll see you in a month.",false
12,Client,Okay.,false
21,Therapist,"Hello Laura, I appreciate you taking the time to meet with me today.",false
21,Client,Hi.,false
21,Therapist,"Before we begin, I want to make sure you're comfortable and aware of what our conversation will entail. Is that okay with you?",false
21,Client,Yeah.,false
21,Therapist,"Great. To start, I'd like to get to know you a bit better and understand what brings you here. Can you tell me a little about yourself?",false
21,Client,"Well, my name is Laura, I'm 17 years old, and I'm a senior in high school.",false
21,Therapist,That's helpful to know. What are your plans and aspirations for the future?,false
21,Client,"Hopefully, I'll go to college and get good enough grades to be accepted.",false
21,Therapist,That sounds like a great goal. Do you have any ideas about which colleges you might be interested in attending or what you'd like to study?,false
21,Client,"Maybe some schools in the area, or possibly out-of-state.",false
21,Therapist,Keeping your options open can be a good idea. What subjects are you considering studying?,false
21,Client,Possibly pre-law.,false
21,Therapist,That's interesting. What do you enjoy doing in your free time?,false
21,Client,"I like hanging out with friends, going to parties, or attending school events like football games.",false
21,Therapist,It sounds like you value social connections and having fun. Can you tell me more about your friendships and social life?,false
21,Client,"I have a moderate number of friends, not too many, but not too few either.",false
21,Therapist,That makes sense. How would you describe your relationships with your family members?,false
21,Client,"I love them and want them to think well of me, so I try to be someone they can be proud of.",false
21,Therapist,Family is important to you. Do you have any siblings?,false
21,Client,"Yes, I have one sister.",false
21,Therapist,"Okay. Now, I'd like to discuss your experiences with alcohol. Have you ever had any drinks at parties or social gatherings?",false
21,Client,Maybe one or two drinks at most.,false
21,Therapist,Can you tell me more about how alcohol fits into your social life?,false
21,Client,"I usually just hold a drink so it looks like I'm drinking, even if I'm not, to avoid pressure from others.",false
21,Therapist,You feel like having a drink helps you fit in with your peers. How often do you find yourself in situations where alcohol is present?,false
21,Client,Maybe one or two weekends a month.,false
21,Therapist,And what kind of situations are those usually?,false
21,Client,Parties or small social gatherings at someone's house.,false
21,Therapist,"I see. Have you ever been in a car with someone who's been drinking, or driven after drinking yourself?",false
21,Client,"No, never. I know how dangerous that can be.",false
21,Therapist,That's great to hear. You're making responsible choices about your safety and well-being. What do you think are some potential risks associated with underage drinking?,false
21,Client,It can impair your judgment and lead to accidents or other problems.,false
21,Therapist,"Exactly. Now, considering your goals and aspirations, how do you think alcohol might fit into your life in the future?",false
21,Client,"Probably a very small role, if any, since I have big plans for my future.",false
21,Therapist,"That makes sense. On a scale of 1 to 10, how important is it for you to make some adjustments to your drinking habits?",false
21,Client,Maybe a five or six.,false
21,Therapist,And how confident do you feel about making those changes if you decide to?,false
21,Client,"Pretty confident, maybe an 8 or 9 out of 10.",false
21,Therapist,Okay. What kind of goal might be helpful for you to set regarding your drinking habits?,false
21,Client,"Maybe stopping altogether, at least for the next party I attend.",false
21,Therapist,That's a great idea. What benefits do you think you might experience if you follow through with that goal?,false
21,Client,"I'll have all my senses and be aware of everything, and it will be better for my health.",false
21,Therapist,Those are excellent reasons. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss or any questions you have for me?,false
21,Client,"No, I think that's all.",false
21,Therapist,"Alright, it was great talking with you, Laura. Let's plan to meet again in a few weeks to check in on your progress.",false
21,Client,"Okay, that sounds good.",false
21,Therapist,"Before we go, is there anything else you'd like to add or any concerns you have?",false
21,Client,"No, I'm okay.",false
21,Therapist,"Great, thank you for sharing your thoughts with me today, Laura.",false
21,Client,No problem.,false
24,Therapist,How can I assist you today?,false
24,Client,"Yeah, I hope so. My workplace just implemented a smoke-free policy, and to be honest, I'm not too thrilled about it. I plan on continuing to smoke, but I was wondering if there are any strategies that could help me manage my cravings throughout the day, like when I usually grab a beer and smoke after work.",false
24,Therapist,"So, it sounds like the new smoke-free policy at your workplace is causing you some distress?",false
24,Client,"No, I'm not interested in quitting smoking. I enjoy it, and it helps me relax, so I don't see the issue with it.",false
24,Therapist,Can you tell me more about how smoking fits into your daily routine? This will help me understand your situation better.,false
24,Client,"I smoke around less than a pack a day, which doesn't seem too excessive. I've been smoking for about five years now, and although I could quit if I wanted to, I don't feel like doing so at this time.",false
24,Therapist,"Okay, so it seems like smoking is currently an important part of your life, and you're not ready to make any changes, but you do feel confident that you could quit if you decided to do so in the future.",false
24,Client,"Yes, I'm sure I could quit if I wanted to.",false
24,Therapist,What gives you that confidence?,false
24,Client,"Well, I just don't see why I couldn't quit; smoking is something I do for enjoyment, like during breaks at work or after a long day.",false
24,Therapist,"I see. On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being not considering quitting at all and 10 being ready to quit, where would you say you are right now?",false
24,Client,"I'd probably say a 2; I hadn't thought about quitting until the announcement at work today, and even now, I'm not considering it.",false
24,Therapist,What made you choose 2 instead of 1?,false
24,Client,"I guess anything is possible, and maybe I could be persuaded to quit. Are there things that could help me want to stop smoking?",false
24,Therapist,"There are many products available that can help reduce your urge to smoke, such as nicotine replacement options and medications that your doctor could prescribe to decrease withdrawal symptoms and even the desire to smoke.",false
24,Client,"Okay, that's good to know. I'm not planning on doing anything about it today, but it's nice to have options; if I decide to quit, I'll have tools to help me.",false
24,Therapist,"And going back to that scale, what do you think would need to happen for you to move from a 2 to a 4 or 5?",false
24,Client,"I'm not sure; maybe if one of my friends decided to quit with me, that would make a difference, but all my friends smoke, so I don't see that happening anytime soon.",false
24,Therapist,"That's an interesting point. Now that your workplace is going smoke-free, it's possible that some of your coworkers might be considering quitting as well.",false
24,Client,That's a good point; I hadn't thought of that. It could be helpful to have someone to go through the process with.,false
24,Therapist,"Okay, it seems like you're primarily looking for information today, and I'm happy to help you explore these options whenever you're ready.",false
24,Client,"Okay, thanks a lot.",false
27,Therapist,"I understand that your asthma symptoms have been particularly challenging to manage, and we need to explore ways to improve your health and prevent future episodes.",false
27,Client,"Mm-hmm. Yeah, I definitely don't want to come back here. But, uh, the doctor mentioned that my dog, Oscar, might be connected to my asthma symptoms, which seems surprising to me.",false
27,Therapist,You seem a bit taken aback by this information.,false
27,Client,"The thing is, I've had him for 12 years already, and now it's suddenly a problem, which doesn't make sense to me.",false
27,Therapist,"It sounds like you're struggling to understand the timing of this issue. I'm sure you've received some information from the clinic about managing asthma symptoms, and pets can often be a significant trigger.",false
27,Client,"Yeah, but I've seen the materials and even read them. All I've been doing is taking my medicine, so I don't feel like I have a deep understanding of this.",false
27,Therapist,"Just to clarify, you're saying that despite having access to information about asthma management, you're not feeling fully informed about your specific situation?",false
27,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
27,Therapist,"I want to make sure I understand your perspective. You've made significant efforts to prioritize your health, such as almost quitting smoking, and you're concerned about being there for your baby.",false
27,Client,"Yeah, that's right. John Carlo is my baby's name.",false
27,Therapist,"It's great that you're taking steps to care for yourself and your family. Now, let's discuss the challenge of addressing the issue with your dog, Oscar. I know it won't be easy, but there are options available, such as finding a new home for him through friends, family, or adoption services.",false
27,Client,"Uh, this is feeling overwhelming right now. My baby, John Carlo, is fine; he doesn't have any issues with the dog. It's just me who has asthma, and I'm not sure I can part with Oscar.",false
27,Therapist,"I understand that this is a difficult conversation, Sal. My primary concern is your health and well-being, especially given the severity of your asthma attacks. I want to make sure you appreciate the potential risks associated with unmanaged asthma.",false
27,Client,"So, you're saying that Oscar could potentially be life-threatening to me? But he hasn't caused any issues for 12 years, and the doctor is considering other factors like stress, finances, or drinking.",false
27,Therapist,"Sal, what's important to recognize is that your asthma has been progressively worsening over time. You've likely noticed that your medication has been increased in strength, and there's a limit to how much medication can help manage your symptoms.",false
27,Client,"Well, they can just keep giving me stronger medicine, and I'll keep Oscar.",false
27,Therapist,"Sal, you're already on a strong medication regimen. I want to ask, do you feel that keeping Oscar is more important than ensuring the health and well-being of yourself and your loved ones, including your baby?",false
27,Client,"I understand what you're saying, but I don't think you fully grasp my situation. I've had this dog for 12 years, so it's not something I can easily change without being certain it's the main cause of my asthma.",false
27,Therapist,"Okay, let's take a moment to consider your concerns and see how we can move forward in a way that feels manageable for you.",false
33,Therapist,"David, can you take a moment to reflect on how you're feeling right now?",false
33,Client,"I'm feeling pretty good, I suppose.",false
33,Therapist,Would you like to explore this further and see what we can discover together?,false
33,Client,"Yes, let's check it out.",false
33,Therapist,What are your thoughts on the progress we've made so far?,false
33,Client,It looks like that issue was fixed really nicely.,false
33,Therapist,I notice that there's still some staining present. Can you share your thoughts on what might be contributing to that?,false
33,Client,"Well, it's probably due to the usual factors - smoking, wine, coffee, and all that.",false
33,Therapist,Have you considered the possibility of quitting smoking at this point in time?,false
33,Client,"I've thought about it, but it's not something I'm ready to pursue right now. I've tried before, and it didn't work out.",false
33,Therapist,"I understand that you might feel like you're being lectured or judged, but that's not my intention. Can you help me understand your perspective on this?",false
33,Client,"Yeah, I know people think I should quit, but it's not that easy. I've heard it all before, and it gets frustrating.",false
33,Therapist,"It sounds like you feel like you're being told what to do, rather than being supported in making your own decisions. Is that a fair assessment?",false
33,Client,"Yeah, that's right. If it were easy, everyone would do it, but it's not that simple.",false
33,Therapist,Can you tell me more about your experience with smoking and how it fits into your life?,false
33,Client,"I've been smoking for 40 years, since I was 14, and I've quit a few times, but it's always been a consistent part of my life.",false
33,Therapist,It sounds like you feel like you've tried everything and nothing has worked. Is that correct?,false
33,Client,"Yeah, I don't think anything is going to work for me at this point.",false
33,Therapist,"You're right that ultimately, the decision to quit smoking is yours to make. Can you help me understand what might motivate you to consider quitting in the future?",false
33,Client,"Honestly, I'm not sure. I've already had some serious health issues, and that didn't do it, so I'm not sure what would.",false
33,Therapist,"I appreciate your honesty, David. If you were to decide to quit smoking, what do you think would need to happen for that to occur?",false
33,Client,"Like I said, I'm not sure. I've already had some major health scares, and that didn't do it, so I don't know.",false
33,Therapist,I want to respect your autonomy while also expressing my concern for your well-being. Would it be okay if we discussed this further at our next visit?,false
33,Client,"Yeah, that's fine. I'm always open to listening, as long as you're not going to lecture me.",false
33,Therapist,I'll do my best to strike a balance between sharing my concerns and respecting your boundaries. Is that acceptable to you?,false
33,Client,"Yeah, that sounds good.",false
33,Therapist,"I'm glad we could have this conversation, David. I want you to know that I'm here to support you, wherever you are in your journey.",false
33,Client,"Okay, thanks, doc.",false
33,Therapist,"You're welcome, David. Thank you for taking the time to talk with me today.",false
33,Client,Thanks.,false
36,Therapist,"Good morning, Barbara Roberts?",false
36,Client,"Yes, good morning.",false
36,Therapist,"Hello, I'm Dr. Betty, one of the new GPs in the practice. How would you like me to address you today?",false
36,Client,"You can call me Barbara, thank you.",false
36,Therapist,"Thank you, Barbara. I understand you normally see Dr. Brown. Is that correct?",false
36,Client,"Yes, Dr. Brown is my usual doctor.",false
36,Therapist,"What brings you to see me today, Barbara?",false
36,Client,"I've been experiencing some persistent stomach problems, and I was hoping you might be able to help me find a solution.",false
36,Therapist,Can you tell me more about your stomach issues? What symptoms have you been experiencing?,false
36,Client,"I have discomfort almost all the time, bloating, and my bowel movements are irregular - sometimes constipated, sometimes diarrhea. I also get cramping and stabbing pains, and I often feel the urge to use the restroom.",false
36,Therapist,It sounds like you're dealing with a range of challenging symptoms. How long have you been experiencing these issues?,false
36,Client,"I think it started after a holiday in Egypt about four years ago. I had a bad bout of sickness and diarrhea, and my stomach hasn't been right since then.",false
36,Therapist,"So, you've been living with these symptoms for approximately four years now. What treatments have you tried so far?",false
36,Client,"Dr. Brown prescribed some muscle relaxants initially, and I've also tried various herbal remedies from a health shop, as well as Immodium.",false
36,Therapist,"Have you noticed any significant changes in your symptoms over time? For example, are there times when they're better or worse?",false
36,Client,"Actually, last year during my son's wedding, I was feeling quite well, and my symptoms were barely noticeable.",false
36,Therapist,That's interesting. And what about times when your symptoms are particularly bad? Are there any patterns or triggers you've noticed?,false
36,Client,"Yes, it seems to be worse when my husband is away, which happens a couple of times a month for his job.",false
36,Therapist,I see. It sounds like you might be noticing some connection between your emotional state and your physical symptoms. Have you had any thoughts about what might be causing your stomach problems?,false
36,Client,"Well, I've wondered if it could be an infection that never fully cleared up, or possibly IBS, since a friend of mine has that and it sounds similar.",false
36,Therapist,And have you discussed these concerns with Dr. Brown? What does he think might be going on?,false
36,Client,"He thinks it's all in my head, that it's just stress.",false
36,Therapist,"I understand that can be frustrating. As we discuss your symptoms and history, I want to assure you that I'm taking your physical discomfort seriously.",false
36,Client,"Thank you, I appreciate that.",false
36,Therapist,"Given that we've explored various treatments and investigations without finding a clear cause, I'd like to consider a different approach. How do you feel about exploring how your daily life and emotional well-being might be impacting your symptoms?",false
36,Client,"I'm not sure... I just know the pain is real, and it feels physical.",false
36,Therapist,"Absolutely, your pain is real, and we'll work together to address it. I'm suggesting that we also look at how other factors in your life might be influencing your experience of those symptoms.",false
36,Client,"Okay, I suppose that makes sense.",false
36,Therapist,"Let's summarize what we've discussed so far. You've been experiencing persistent stomach issues for about four years, with various symptoms and treatments tried without significant relief.",false
36,Client,That's right.,false
36,Therapist,"And you're hoping that together, we can find a new approach to help manage your symptoms and improve your quality of life.",false
36,Client,"Yes, exactly.",false
36,Therapist,"Before we proceed, I'd like to propose that we work on rationalizing the medications you're taking and explore ways to reintroduce pleasurable activities into your daily routine.",false
36,Client,"That sounds like a good idea, I think.",false
36,Therapist,Shall we schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss this further and create a plan tailored to your needs?,false
36,Client,"Yes, that would be great. I'll make an appointment.",false
36,Therapist,"Excellent. In preparation for our next meeting, could you please make a list of all the medications you're currently taking?",false
36,Client,"Yes, I can do that.",false
36,Therapist,"Great, thank you, Barbara. I'm looking forward to our next session and working together to find ways to improve your symptoms and overall well-being.",false
36,Client,"Thank you, I appreciate it.",false
36,Therapist,"You're welcome, Barbara. Have a good day.",false
36,Client,"You too, thank you.",false
45,Therapist,"Hello Mary, how has your day been so far?",false
45,Client,"It's fine, where do I need to sign?",false
45,Therapist,"You can sign right there. I sense that you might not be in the mood for conversation today, is that correct?",false
45,Client,"Not really, I'm just not feeling like talking.",false
45,Therapist,"Okay, I understand. It seems like you had a bit of a challenging day at school, missing your first hour of class. Can you tell me more about what was going on?",false
45,Client,"Yeah, whatever, it's just the same old thing every day, I don't know.",false
45,Therapist,It sounds like that might not be a priority for you right now. Can you help me understand what's on your mind?,false
45,Client,"It's just that I don't really get why I have to do this, I signed your paper, so why are you asking me all these questions?",false
45,Therapist,You're wondering about the purpose of our visits and my role in your life. Would you like me to explain again what this program is about and how it can support you?,false
45,Client,"I guess so, if you think it will help.",false
45,Therapist,"As your caseworker, my goal is to ensure your safety and well-being, which includes checking in with you daily, monitoring your GPS, and making sure you're following the rules. I also want to get to know you better and understand what's going on in your life.",false
45,Client,So you just want to know all my business?,false
45,Therapist,"I can see how it might feel that way, but my intention is to support you, not intrude. I care about your well-being and want to help you achieve your goals.",false
45,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
45,Therapist,"When we first met, you mentioned wanting to get off this program as quickly as possible. Is that still a goal for you?",false
45,Client,Yeah.,false
45,Therapist,"Being here when you need to be is an important step towards achieving that goal. However, I sense that you're still feeling a bit frustrated about the whole situation.",false
45,Client,"Yeah, I mean, I'll be here if I have to be, but I'm not making any promises that I won't leave.",false
45,Therapist,You're still unsure if you can successfully complete this program and feel like you're being held back. Can you tell me more about what's going through your mind?,false
45,Client,"No, it's just that I don't get why you need to know all my business. Why do you care?",false
45,Therapist,"I understand that it can feel overwhelming with so many people involved in your life right now, including the courts and your mom. It's a lot to take in.",false
45,Client,"Mm-hmm, it's just too much.",false
45,Therapist,"Yeah, it can be really tough to deal with all these rules and expectations. Some people have told me that they didn't realize how much they valued their freedom until it was taken away.",false
45,Client,"Right, that's the one thing I wish I had right now.",false
45,Therapist,Your freedom is something that you're really missing. What do you think you need to do to get it back?,false
45,Client,I guess just sign your papers and not get in trouble again.,false
45,Therapist,"That's a good start. Signing the papers when I come by is an important part of this process, even if it feels annoying at times. What else do you think you can do to work towards getting your freedom back?",false
45,Client,"Not doing what I did before, so I don't have to be stuck in my house with all these people coming to visit me and knowing my business.",false
45,Therapist,"So, not wanting to go through this experience again is motivating you to make positive changes. That's a great start.",false
45,Client,Yeah.,false
45,Therapist,"I appreciate your effort, Mary, even when it feels like a hassle. Thank you for signing the paperwork and cooperating with me.",false
45,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
45,Therapist,"Before I go, is there anything else you'd like to talk about or share with me?",false
45,Client,Not really.,false
45,Therapist,"Okay, well, I'll see you later today then.",false
45,Client,Alright.,false
45,Therapist,"Alright, take care.",false
45,Client,Bye.,false
42,Therapist,"It sounds like you're experiencing a significant challenge with your weight loss, and despite your efforts to exercise regularly, you're not seeing the results you had hoped for.",false
42,Client,"I'm just having a lot of trouble losing the rest of the weight; no matter how much I try to exercise or run, it feels like nothing is working.",false
42,Therapist,"So, it seems like you've reached a plateau in your weight loss journey, and even with increased physical activity, the scale isn't reflecting the progress you're expecting?",false
42,Client,"No, and I'm unsure what I'm doing wrong because I continue to exercise, but I'm not seeing any changes.",false
42,Therapist,"It's as if you feel like you're putting in a lot of effort without getting the desired outcome, and that's frustrating for you.",false
42,Client,"Yes, that's exactly how I feel.",false
42,Therapist,And this experience is leaving you feeling somewhat discouraged?,false
42,Client,"Yes, it is; even when I try to talk to my family about it, like my mom or dad, they don't seem to care or offer the support I'm looking for.",false
42,Therapist,"You feel like you're navigating this weight loss journey on your own, without the support system you wish you had?",false
42,Client,"Yes, that's how it feels.",false
42,Therapist,"It sounds like you were hoping for more understanding and encouragement from your family, but instead, you're feeling a bit isolated in this effort.",false
42,Client,"Especially my dad; not only does he not want to support me, but he actually thinks I should be gaining weight back.",false
42,Therapist,I see; can you help me understand more about what's going on there?,false
42,Client,"It feels like my weight loss is being perceived as a way of distancing myself from my family, and my dad believes I'm trying to conform to an ideal image rather than focusing on my health and well-being.",false
42,Therapist,Tell me more about how that dynamic is affecting you.,false
42,Client,"To him, it seems like losing weight means I'm trying to fit into a certain mold, but for me, it's simply about wanting to be healthy and feel good in my own body.",false
54,Therapist,"Hello Scott, it's great to see you again. How have you been since our last conversation about exercising?",false
54,Client,Hi. I've been thinking a lot about getting back into exercise.,false
54,Therapist,You mentioned earlier that you wanted to discuss your struggles with exercising. Can you tell me more about what's been on your mind?,false
54,Client,"I really want to start working out again, but I haven't been able to get back into the habit. I used to go to the gym regularly, but over the past couple of years, I've stopped going and now I feel like I need to get back into it.",false
54,Therapist,"It sounds like you're feeling a bit stuck. Have you considered reflecting on what motivates you to want to start exercising again, and what might be holding you back?",false
54,Client,"Okay, that makes sense. I can try doing that.",false
54,Therapist,Which gym do you currently have a membership with?,false
54,Client,I belong to the Sport Fitness Center.,false
54,Therapist,How convenient is the gym's location for you? Is it easily accessible from your home?,false
54,Client,"It's just a couple of miles away, so it's pretty close.",false
54,Therapist,"That's great. Being close by could make it easier for you to incorporate physical activity into your daily routine, such as walking or biking there.",false
54,Client,"If I walked that far, I might not even need to go to the gym, right? But I know I need to do more than just cardio.",false
54,Therapist,"You're recognizing the importance of a balanced fitness routine. In addition to cardiovascular exercise, it's great that you're thinking about the value of weightlifting and other forms of training.",false
54,Client,It would be really important for me to incorporate those elements into my workout routine.,false
54,Therapist,What are your goals for getting back into exercise? Is it primarily about physical appearance or overall well-being?,false
54,Client,"Honestly, I think it's more about feeling better physically and mentally. I've noticed changes in my body that I'm not happy with, and I'd like to get back to a healthier state.",false
54,Therapist,"It's completely understandable that you want to feel more comfortable in your own skin. While physical appearance can be a motivator, it's great that you're also considering the importance of your overall health.",false
54,Client,"Yeah, I just want to feel better and be more comfortable. I think that's the main thing for me.",false
54,Therapist,"Your health and well-being are crucial, and it's wonderful that you're recognizing that. Getting back into exercise can have a significant impact on both your physical and mental health.",false
54,Client,"I know I'm not getting any younger, so I should probably get started sooner rather than later.",false
54,Therapist,"You've had success with exercising in the past, so it's possible to get back into a routine that works for you. Sometimes, it just takes a bit of planning and commitment.",false
54,Client,"Yeah, I need to make time for it.",false
54,Therapist,"Finding time can be challenging, but it might mean making small adjustments to your daily schedule, such as waking up a bit earlier to fit in a workout.",false
54,Client,I've got to make time for it. That's what it comes down to.,false
54,Therapist,"Exactly. For our next session, I'd like you to experiment with adjusting your schedule to accommodate exercise and also work on that list of motivations we discussed. Remember, taking care of your health is a priority.",false
54,Client,"Okay, sounds good.",false
54,Therapist,"Great, I'll see you next week then.",false
54,Client,"Okay, very good. Thanks.",false
54,Therapist,"You're welcome, Scott. Take care until then.",false
54,Client,Okay.,false
51,Therapist,Can you share with me your current understanding of the flu shot and its importance?,false
51,Client,"I know the flu can be severe, but since I'm relatively healthy, I'm not sure I need it; I've always thought it was more crucial for older adults or those with compromised health.",false
51,Therapist,"So, it sounds like you're considering that the flu shot might be more beneficial for individuals who are more susceptible to illness?",false
51,Client,"Yes, that's right.",false
51,Therapist,"Would you be open to learning more about the flu vaccine and why it's recommended for everyone, regardless of age or health status?",false
51,Client,"Yes, I'm willing to listen.",false
51,Therapist,"You're correct that your youth and good health would likely help you recover from the flu, but it's also important to consider how getting vaccinated can protect those around you who might be more vulnerable, such as the elderly, pregnant women, and young children, by reducing the risk of transmission.",false
51,Client,"Okay, I understand.",false
51,Therapist,"Now that we've discussed this information, how do you feel about considering the flu vaccine for yourself?",false
51,Client,"Well, my grandparents are older and might not handle the flu well, and I also have a pregnant coworker, so I should probably get it to help keep them safe.",false
51,Therapist,I see; it sounds like you're thinking about the potential impact on your loved ones and colleagues who might be at higher risk.,false
51,Client,"Yes, exactly; getting the flu shot could help protect them.",false
51,Therapist,"So, it seems like you're recognizing the value of getting vaccinated not just for yourself, but also as a way to care for those around you who are more vulnerable to serious illness.",false
51,Client,"Yes, that's right.",false
57,Therapist,"Mr. Johnson, I'd like to discuss your cholesterol levels and the medication your doctor has prescribed for you.",false
57,Client,Yeah?,false
57,Therapist,I'm here to help you understand how to get the most benefit from your medication and answer any questions you may have.,false
57,Client,I've already talked to my doctor about my medicine; that's their area of expertise.,false
57,Therapist,"I understand, but as part of your care team, it's also my role to support you in managing your condition and making informed decisions about your treatment.",false
57,Client,"Honestly, I'm not sure if I'll take the medication. I know I need to lower my cholesterol, but I'm concerned about the potential side effects, particularly muscle weakness, which could impact my ability to perform my job as a truck driver.",false
57,Therapist,Can you tell me more about what your doctor shared with you regarding the risks associated with high cholesterol if left unmanaged?,false
57,Client,"Yes, they mentioned that if my cholesterol remains high, I'm at risk for stroke or heart attack down the line.",false
57,Therapist,I see. It sounds like you're weighing the potential benefits of the medication against the possible side effects. Can you help me understand what's most concerning to you about the muscle weakness?,false
57,Client,"Well, it's just that I need to be able to do my job, and muscle weakness would make that difficult. That's my main concern right now.",false
57,Therapist,"I understand your concerns about the potential impact on your daily life. While the risk of muscle weakness is a consideration, it's worth noting that it's relatively rare and typically reversible if addressed promptly.",false
57,Client,"I guess what I'm saying is that the present concern for me is being able to work without any issues, so the potential side effects are very real to me.",false
57,Therapist,"It makes sense that you're prioritizing your current needs. If you were to experience any muscle weakness, we could work with your doctor to adjust your treatment plan as needed.",false
57,Client,"Okay, well, maybe I'll just take the medication and think about it some more, but like I said, my job is a big concern for me.",false
57,Therapist,"I appreciate your willingness to consider the medication. Remember, if you do experience any side effects, they are typically not permanent and can be managed with adjustments to your treatment.",false
57,Client,"Alright, fine.",false
57,Therapist,"It's crucial to remember that the risks associated with unmanaged high cholesterol, such as stroke or heart attack, are significant. Taking your medication as prescribed can help mitigate those risks.",false
57,Client,"Okay, sure, I'll pick up the medication and take it as directed.",false
57,Therapist,"That's a good plan. If you have any further questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out.",false
57,Client,Okay.,false
63,Therapist,"Tom, I understand that this infection has been quite painful for you, but fortunately, we have antibiotics that can help. If you commit to taking them faithfully for 10 days, I'm confident that your infection will clear up. Are you able to do that?",false
63,Client,Definitely.,false
63,Therapist,I'd also like to discuss the screening form you filled out earlier today regarding drug use. Is that okay with you?,false
63,Client,Okay.,false
63,Therapist,Let's take a look at the form. It indicates that you occasionally use drugs for non-medical reasons. Can you tell me which substances you're using?,false
63,Client,I use meth.,false
63,Therapist,How do you typically use meth - do you snort it or smoke it?,false
63,Client,I always snort it.,false
63,Therapist,"You don't inject it, correct?",false
63,Client,No.,false
63,Therapist,Are there any other substances you're using besides meth?,false
63,Client,Just some alcohol.,false
63,Therapist,How often would you say you use meth?,false
63,Client,Two or three times a month.,false
63,Therapist,"So, it sounds like you're an occasional user of meth, and you don't use it very frequently. Is that right?",false
63,Client,Right.,false
63,Therapist,"You only snort meth, without injecting or smoking it. Is that correct?",false
63,Client,Right.,false
63,Therapist,"As you may know, methamphetamine use is associated with various health risks. Given your usage, I'd categorize you as a risky user. This is different from being addicted or a heavy user, but it's still not a healthy category due to the potential consequences, including sexually transmitted diseases. Do you think your current STD might be linked to your methamphetamine use?",false
63,Client,"Yeah, it could be because I was high when I had unprotected sex, and I wouldn't have done that if I weren't under the influence.",false
63,Therapist,"Normally, you're very careful and use protection during sex, correct?",false
63,Client,"Definitely, yeah.",false
63,Therapist,It seems to me that methamphetamine might have impaired your judgment in this situation. Is that a fair assessment?,false
63,Client,Yeah.,false
63,Therapist,Are there any other ways in which methamphetamine is affecting your life?,false
63,Client,"No, I mean, like I said, I only do it in clubs with friends, two or three times a month at most. I don't think it's having other significant impacts, but I am concerned about this STD - I never expected to get gonorrhea.",false
63,Therapist,"I understand your concern, and I'd recommend that you stop using methamphetamine altogether. There are several reasons for this, but that would be my advice.",false
63,Client,"I understand, but it's hard for me to consider quitting because it's such a big part of my social life - all my friends use it in the clubs, and that's where I see them and have sex. It's just part of the scene.",false
63,Therapist,"So, you recognize that methamphetamine has some negative consequences, but at the same time, it's closely tied to your social and sex life, making it difficult for you to quit?",false
63,Client,"Yeah, I don't think it would be easy, but I'm not saying I'm not willing to try.",false
63,Therapist,"If you were to consider how ready you are to stop using methamphetamine completely, on a scale from zero to 10, with zero being not ready at all and 10 being fully ready, where would you place yourself?",false
63,Client,"Uh, three.",false
63,Therapist,What makes you choose three instead of one or two?,false
63,Client,"Well, this experience with gonorrhea has been really uncomfortable, and I know I don't think clearly when I'm on meth. The risk of getting AIDS or HIV the same way is scary - that's why it's higher than a one or two.",false
63,Therapist,Are there any other concerns you have about using methamphetamine?,false
63,Client,"Yeah, I worry about what it might be cut with - it could be something bad, and that scares me sometimes.",false
63,Therapist,"Initially, I thought you might not be very interested in quitting methamphetamine, but it sounds like you have several reasons for wanting to stop. These include the potential for it being cut with harmful substances and the risk of getting other STDs, including HIV.",false
63,Client,Yeah.,false
63,Therapist,What do you think would make it easier for you to reduce or quit using methamphetamine?,false
63,Client,"Having something else to do on weekends, a different social life.",false
63,Therapist,How could you go about getting a different social life?,false
63,Client,That's the hard part - almost everyone I know uses meth.,false
63,Therapist,Is there anyone in your life who doesn't use methamphetamine?,false
63,Client,My sister.,false
63,Therapist,Have you talked to her about your meth use?,false
63,Client,"Not really, but I think she knows I do it sometimes. We're close, and I think I could talk to her about it - she might be able to help.",false
63,Therapist,"On one hand, quitting methamphetamine would be difficult due to the social benefits you get from using it. On the other hand, there are compelling reasons for you to quit, including the potential health risks.",false
63,Client,Yes.,false
63,Therapist,"There are also steps you could take to make quitting easier, such as talking to your sister and getting support.",false
63,Client,Yes.,false
63,Therapist,"I recommend that you avoid using methamphetamine altogether, but ultimately, the decision is yours. Would you be open to meeting again in a month to follow up?",false
63,Client,"Yeah, sure.",false
66,Therapist,"Hello, Mr. Stowe. I'm Bruce Berger, your case manager with the health plan. How are you feeling today?",false
66,Client,Hi. It's nice to meet you.,false
66,Therapist,I understand you're here to discuss managing your diabetes. Can you tell me a bit about what brings you here today?,false
66,Client,"Yeah, I just found out I have diabetes and my doctor said my blood sugar is very high. She explained all the potential complications, which sounds really scary and overwhelming.",false
66,Therapist,It sounds like you're feeling quite overwhelmed by the diagnosis and the potential consequences of not managing your diabetes effectively.,false
66,Client,"Yeah, she mentioned problems with my legs and other things that could happen if I don't take care of it. It's all a bit much to take in.",false
66,Therapist,You seem to be struggling to come to terms with the news and are worried about the impact it could have on your life. Is that right?,false
66,Client,"Yeah, I'm scared and unsure if I can do everything I need to do to manage my condition.",false
66,Therapist,"So, you're not only concerned about the potential health consequences but also feeling uncertain about your ability to make the necessary lifestyle changes.",false
66,Client,"Exactly, it's all so discouraging. The thought of having to do all these things to manage my diabetes feels like a huge task.",false
66,Therapist,"It sounds like the sheer amount of information and the changes you need to make are feeling overwhelming, making you worry that you might not be able to prevent the negative outcomes.",false
66,Client,"Yeah, it looks like a massive task that I'm not sure I can handle, and that's making the whole situation feel even bleaker.",false
66,Therapist,"I'd like to help you break down these tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks so we can focus on getting your blood sugar under control. Your doctor is right; we do need to get your blood sugar down to prevent complications.",false
66,Client,Okay.,false
66,Therapist,"Let's take this one step at a time. There are three main areas to focus on: taking your medication as prescribed, changing your eating habits to healthier options, and increasing your physical activity. Which of these feels like something you could start with?",false
66,Client,"Well, I don't think taking my medicine will be too much trouble, especially since I know my blood sugar is high.",false
66,Therapist,That's a great place to start. Taking your medication as prescribed can have a significant impact on your blood sugar levels.,false
66,Client,"Yeah, I'm pretty good at taking my medications.",false
66,Therapist,That's excellent. It seems like taking your medicine once a day will be manageable for you.,false
66,Client,"Yeah, I think I can do that.",false
66,Therapist,"In addition to medication, we'll also want to work on changing your eating habits to healthier options and increasing your physical activity over time. This could be as simple as walking more or using the stairs instead of the elevator.",false
66,Client,"My doctor also mentioned monitoring my blood sugar, which seemed like a lot to take in.",false
66,Therapist,Monitoring your blood sugar is an important tool to help you understand how the changes you're making are affecting your condition. It will give you feedback on your progress.,false
66,Client,"Oh, okay. That makes sense.",false
66,Therapist,"By tracking your blood sugar, you'll be able to see the impact of taking your medication, eating healthier, and being more active. This can help motivate you to continue making positive changes.",false
66,Client,"How does all this make me feel now? Well, I like that we can take it one step at a time; that takes some pressure off.",false
66,Therapist,It sounds like having a step-by-step approach is helping you feel more in control and less overwhelmed.,false
66,Client,"Yeah, being able to talk through this with you and tackle it one step at a time makes me feel better. I'm pretty sure I can start with taking my medication.",false
66,Therapist,"You seem committed to starting with your medication, which is a great first step.",false
66,Client,"Yeah, as long as there aren't any significant side effects, I think I can manage that.",false
69,Therapist,"Hello Dr. Martin, I understand you have a question for me. Could you please share what's on your mind?",false
69,Client,"I apologize for the confusion, but are you the pharmacist I can consult with about my medication, specifically regarding citalopram?",false
69,Therapist,"Yes, I'm the pharmacist on duty today. Citalopram is an antidepressant available in 10, 20, and 40-milligram doses, with a half-life of approximately 35 hours, and it's primarily excreted through urine; common side effects include those related to sexual function, cardiovascular health, and gastrointestinal issues.",false
69,Client,"My main concern is whether citalopram has any interactions with phenelzine, could you clarify that for me?",false
69,Therapist,"I see your concern, let me check on the potential interaction between citalopram and phenelzine to provide you with an accurate answer.",false
69,Client,"Thank you for addressing my question; I appreciate your time, but I have another appointment I need to attend to now.",false
69,Therapist,"You're welcome, Dr. Martin. Feel free to reach out to me anytime if you have further questions or concerns.",false
72,Therapist,"Chris, I wanted to touch base with you about our school's zero-tolerance policy for drugs and alcohol, and as athletic director, it's my responsibility to ensure all student-athletes are aware of and adhering to this rule. There have been some concerns raised about a party over the weekend, and I'd like to discuss this with you.",false
72,Client,"Actually, I did want to talk to you about what happened last weekend. Normally, I'm focused on my studies and don't attend parties, but my friends were pressuring me to go, so I used that as an opportunity to convince my parents to let me attend.",false
72,Therapist,I see.,false
72,Client,"When I got to the party, I was surrounded by an environment that's not familiar to me, with people drinking and playing games involving alcohol. In that moment, I felt pressured to fit in and not be ostracized.",false
72,Therapist,"It can be challenging to navigate situations like that. As someone who's been in similar circumstances, I understand the temptation. However, as a member of the team, it's essential we adhere to the rules.",false
72,Client,"I understand the rules, and I know it's not good for my health or performance as an athlete.",false
72,Therapist,"You're aware of the potential consequences, but it sounds like you're struggling with peer pressure.",false
72,Client,"As a member of the sports team, there's a sense of unity and expectation to fit in, not just on the field but also socially. I feel like I need to lead by example, both in sports and social situations.",false
72,Therapist,"Perhaps this is an opportunity for you to lead in a different way, by making choices that align with your values and goals.",false
72,Client,"I'm concerned that if I don't drink, my teammates might ridicule me or see me as someone who's too strict.",false
72,Therapist,"As a star player, you have a unique position of influence. Who's likely to criticize you for making positive choices?",false
72,Client,"It's not about individual opinions, but rather the fear of being judged by the group as a whole.",false
72,Therapist,"I understand your concerns, Chris. However, as athletic director, it's my responsibility to ensure that all team members are adhering to the rules. I need to be able to trust that you'll make responsible choices.",false
72,Client,"I understand, and I'm willing to commit to avoiding situations where I might feel pressured to drink or engage in behavior that could reflect poorly on the team.",false
72,Therapist,What does that mean for you in terms of making changes to your social life and online presence?,false
72,Client,"It means being more mindful of the parties I attend and avoiding situations where I might be tempted to drink. I'll also be more careful about what I share online, so I'm not putting myself or the team at risk.",false
72,Therapist,"Alright, let's make a deal. If you're going to be on the team, you need to adhere to these expectations.",false
72,Client,"I agree, and I promise to make those changes.",false
72,Therapist,Can I trust that you'll follow through on this commitment?,false
72,Client,"Yes, you can.",false
72,Therapist,"Alright, let's shake on it.",false
72,Client,Alright.,false
72,Therapist,"I'll see you later, Chris.",false
72,Client,See you later.,false
78,Therapist,"Hello, are you Julie Thompson?",false
78,Client,"Yes, that's me.",false
78,Therapist,"Hi Julie, I'm Bruce Berger. I've noticed you're here to pick up a prescription for Sarah's rescue inhaler for her asthma. Can you tell me a bit about what it's been like for you dealing with her asthma episodes?",false
78,Client,"It's been really tough. I hate seeing her struggle to breathe, and I get worried when she needs to go to the emergency room.",false
78,Therapist,I can imagine how concerning that must be for you. It sounds like you're very invested in her well-being and willing to do what it takes to help her.,false
78,Client,"Yes, I just want what's best for her.",false
78,Therapist,I also noticed it's been a few months since you last picked up the prescription for her chronic inhaler. Are there any challenges or concerns that have prevented you from refilling it?,false
78,Client,"Actually, I did some research and found out it contains steroids, which made me hesitant. I don't want her exposed to potential side effects.",false
78,Therapist,"It's understandable that you'd be cautious about medications, especially when it comes to your child's health. You're clearly dedicated to protecting her.",false
78,Client,"Yes, I just want to make sure she's safe.",false
78,Therapist,I appreciate your diligence. Can we discuss the chronic inhaler and the steroids it contains? I want to address any concerns you may have.,false
78,Client,"Okay, that would be helpful.",false
78,Therapist,"Although the medication is in the same family as anabolic steroids, it's a different type altogether. To put it simply, think of it like comparing a grape to a watermelon - they're related but distinct. The amount of medication in the inhaler is minimal and specifically designed to reduce inflammation in her lungs.",false
78,Client,I didn't realize that. I thought all steroids were the same.,false
78,Therapist,"It's natural to have concerns when we hear the term ""steroid."" But I want to reassure you that this medication is safe for Sarah and won't have the same effects as anabolic steroids.",false
78,Client,"Okay, that makes me feel a bit better.",false
78,Therapist,Would you be open to discussing what happens in Sarah's lungs during an asthma episode? Understanding her condition might help clarify why the chronic inhaler is important.,false
78,Client,"Yes, I'd like to know more.",false
78,Therapist,"When someone has asthma, their lungs can become extremely sensitive. Imagine having burned skin - even a gentle touch could be painful. The chronic inhaler helps reduce this sensitivity by decreasing inflammation in her lungs.",false
78,Client,"Oh, I see. That makes sense.",false
78,Therapist,"Even though you're careful not to smoke around Sarah, the residue on your clothes can still affect her sensitive lungs. Have you considered how quitting smoking or taking extra precautions might impact her health?",false
78,Client,"Yeah, it's just really hard for me to quit.",false
78,Therapist,"Quitting smoking can be very challenging. However, if you're willing to take small steps, such as smoking only when Sarah is at school and changing your clothes before she returns home, it could make a significant difference.",false
78,Client,That's a good idea. I could try doing that.,false
78,Therapist,"It sounds like we have a plan in place. You'll start using the chronic inhaler to reduce inflammation, and you'll take steps to minimize Sarah's exposure to smoke. We can reassess and adjust as needed.",false
78,Client,"Okay, that sounds good.",false
78,Therapist,"I'm glad we could work together to find a solution. Let's get both prescriptions ready, and you can start using the chronic inhaler right away.",false
78,Client,"Thank you, I appreciate your help.",false
81,Therapist,Can you help me understand your experiences with your parents' parenting style?,false
81,Therapist,Could you share more about how your parents raised you and what that was like for you?,false
81,Therapist,"How have you been feeling lately, and what's been on your mind?",false
81,Client,"I've noticed some changes in my body, and I'm not sure how to feel about them.",false
81,Therapist,"What does it mean to you to be experiencing these physical changes, and how are you coping with them?",false
81,Client,"To be honest, it feels a bit intimidating and uncertain.",false
81,Therapist,It sounds like you're feeling uneasy about the changes in your body; can you tell me more about what's causing that discomfort?,false
81,Client,"Yes, I'm aware that there might be something going on internally, but I don't have much information about it.",false
81,Therapist,I sense that you might be hesitant to take the next step; can you help me understand what's holding you back from scheduling a doctor's appointment?,false
81,Client,"I know you're encouraging me to see a doctor, but I haven't made the call yet.",false
81,Therapist,What do you think is making it difficult for you to make that phone call and take this step?,false
81,Client,It all just feels really overwhelming to me right now.,false
81,Therapist,Can you break down what specifically about this process is feeling overwhelming to you?,false
81,Client,"Well, I'm not a fan of making phone calls, and I know there will be paperwork to fill out; plus, I'm unsure about how to get to the appointment, and I'm really anxious about the medical procedures.",false
81,Therapist,"It seems like your concerns are multifaceted, ranging from logistical challenges to personal discomfort with medical settings and procedures; is that a fair understanding?",false
81,Client,"Yes, that's correct.",false
81,Therapist,How can I best support you in addressing these concerns and making this process more manageable for you?,false
81,Client,Would it be possible for you to help me make the initial call to schedule the appointment?,false
81,Therapist,We can definitely work on that together; I'm here to support you.,false
81,Client,I was also wondering if you could accompany me to the appointment for added support.,false
81,Therapist,"While I'll do my best to accommodate your request, my availability might be limited; however, we can explore options for finding someone to support you during the appointment.",false
90,Therapist,"Tommy, I wanted to discuss some concerns I have after seeing pictures of you and your friends at a party on Facebook. It seems like there might be some underage drinking involved, and I'm worried about the potential risks.",false
90,Client,"It was just a social gathering, and I didn't actively seek out alcohol, but it was available and my friends were drinking, so I decided to join in and have some fun.",false
90,Therapist,"I understand that you might see it as harmless, but there are significant consequences associated with underage drinking, such as legal issues, accidents, or negative impacts on your schoolwork. You have a promising future ahead of you, and I'm concerned about the potential effects.",false
90,Client,"I appreciate your concerns, and I thought I had everything under control. I made sure not to overdo it and kept an eye on my friends to ensure everyone was okay.",false
90,Therapist,"As your therapist, I want to emphasize that any amount of underage drinking can be problematic. Have you considered the potential risks and consequences?",false
90,Client,"Yes, I understand what you're saying, and I've thought about it.",false
90,Therapist,Can you tell me more about your drinking habits? How often do you drink?,false
90,Client,"I don't think I drink excessively; it's mostly at social gatherings, not something I do alone. I'd say it's every other weekend.",false
90,Therapist,"Tommy, I'm worried about the frequency and potential influences on your behavior. Can't you think of alternative activities that might be more beneficial for you?",false
90,Client,I suppose I could focus more on my schoolwork and explore other hobbies instead of attending parties as often. I understand where you're coming from.,false
90,Therapist,"Do you feel like your friends might be influencing your decisions, and perhaps it would be helpful to spend time with different groups, like the youth group?",false
90,Client,"Yeah, I guess I haven't really taken the initiative to make my own choices; I've just been following my friends' lead because it seems like fun. I want to make the most of my high school experience.",false
90,Therapist,It's common for things to seem enjoyable in the moment but ultimately not be the best choice. We often discuss making positive decisions that align with our values and goals. I think it would be beneficial for you to consider making some changes.,false
90,Client,"I see your point, and maybe reducing my drinking could have a positive impact on my life. It makes sense, and I can try to put more effort into cutting back.",false
90,Therapist,"I strongly encourage you to consider quitting altogether. While reducing your drinking is a step in the right direction, I believe it's essential for your well-being.",false
90,Client,"I understand your concerns, but alcohol is prevalent in our society, and I feel like I should be aware of its effects before completely removing it from my life. I don't see it as something that will necessarily ruin my life.",false
90,Therapist,I'm worried that you might be underestimating the risks. Do you want to wait until something dramatic happens before making a change?,false
90,Client,"No, I don't want to wait for something bad to happen. I can imagine a situation where things get out of control, and I want to avoid that. I've been fortunate so far, but I realize I might not have as much control as I think.",false
90,Therapist,Perhaps we can work together to develop a plan that will help you gain control over your drinking and make positive changes.,false
90,Client,"Yeah, that sounds like a good step towards a potentially sober life and experiencing things without the influence of alcohol.",false
90,Therapist,"Okay, let's move forward with that plan.",false
90,Client,Okay.,false
87,Therapist,"To start, I'd like to explain the process we'll be following in our conversation today, which will last around 20 minutes. Typically, I provide feedback based on the questionnaires you completed earlier, and then we discuss those findings together. However, I also want to make sure we begin with what's most important to you.",false
87,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
87,Therapist,"I'm interested in hearing your thoughts, so please feel free to start wherever you'd like.",false
87,Client,"When I was filling out those questionnaires, it was a bit surprising because I don't often think about my drinking as a significant issue, and I rarely consider the amount I drink.",false
87,Therapist,I understand.,false
87,Client,"Filling out the questionnaires made me realize that I wasn't aware of how much I was drinking on a daily basis, and when I tried to keep track, it was more than I expected.",false
87,Therapist,You seemed surprised by your own drinking patterns when you saw them in black and white.,false
87,Client,"Yes, because I had assumed I drank about the same amount as my friends, but when I discussed it with my roommate, she was shocked by how much I was drinking, even on weekends.",false
87,Therapist,"It sounds like this new information has given you a different perspective, and your roommate's reaction also made an impact on you.",false
87,Client,"Yeah, I thought everyone was drinking similarly, but that's not the case. My roommate's surprise at my drinking habits really stood out to me.",false
87,Therapist,"It's clear that realizing your drinking stands out from others is something you hadn't considered before, and it seems to have made a significant impression on you.",false
87,Client,"Yes, that was the most surprising part of filling out those forms for me.",false
87,Therapist,I'd like to explore this further with you.,false
87,Client,Yeah.,false
93,Therapist,"As we explore potential areas for change, I've noticed you've mentioned a desire to increase your physical activity, modify your eating habits, and enhance your body confidence. Which of these aspects resonates with you the most as a starting point for our discussion today?",false
93,Client,"I believe focusing on physical activity could be a manageable initial step, as I anticipate it may be more challenging to alter my nutrition habits immediately, but establishing an activity routine might pave the way for other positive changes.",false
93,Therapist,"So, it seems that increasing physical activity feels like the most accessible change to tackle first.",false
93,Client,"Yes, that's correct.",false
93,Therapist,"Great. Can you elaborate on what motivates you to become more physically active? You've previously mentioned wanting to boost your energy levels and improve your mood, reducing irritability and stress. Are there any other benefits that drive your desire for this change?",false
93,Client,"Yes, I'd like to feel physically stronger and more capable, such as being able to perform everyday tasks with ease, like opening jars. This, combined with potential improvements in mood, productivity, and energy, would be a significant incentive for me, and I also hope it would enhance my body confidence.",false
93,Therapist,"So, you're seeking to feel more physically empowered, which would not only improve your daily functioning but also contribute to a more positive self-image.",false
93,Client,Yes.,false
93,Therapist,"On a scale of zero to 10, with zero indicating no readiness to change your physical activity level and 10 representing high motivation and enthusiasm, where would you place yourself?",false
93,Client,I'd say I'm around an eight.,false
93,Therapist,"Okay, so you're feeling quite motivated. What led you to choose an eight rather than a lower rating, such as six?",false
93,Client,"As I mentioned earlier, I've identified several benefits of increased physical activity, including improved mood, energy, and self-perception, which are all important to me.",false
93,Therapist,"It seems that the numerous advantages of being physically active, including enhanced energy, mood, strength, and body confidence, are significant motivators for you. Are there any other key aspects driving your desire for change that we haven't discussed yet?",false
93,Client,"No, I don't think so.",false
93,Therapist,"Alright, so these are the primary factors for you. Now, if you're interested, we can explore what this might look like in practice and which activities might be a good fit for you.",false
93,Client,"Yes, that would be great.",false
93,Therapist,"Okay, let's proceed with that exploration then.",false
93,Client,Yes.,false
96,Therapist,"I appreciate you taking the time to meet with me today, Katie. To start, could you share a bit about yourself and what led you to schedule this appointment?",false
96,Client,"Yeah, sure. My doctor recommended that I see you due to some concerns he has regarding my pregnancy and the baby, so I'm just following his advice.",false
96,Therapist,It sounds like your doctor has some concerns that prompted him to refer you to me. Can you tell me more about what he's concerned about?,false
96,Client,He's worried about my alcohol consumption during pregnancy.,false
96,Therapist,I understand. Do you have any personal concerns regarding your alcohol intake?,false
96,Client,"No, I don't.",false
96,Therapist,You don't seem to be too concerned about it at this point. It's more of an issue for your doctor than for you.,false
96,Client,That's right.,false
96,Therapist,Would you be willing to share a bit more about your drinking habits and what a typical day is like for you?,false
96,Client,"Okay. Well, I usually have a glass of wine with dinner every night, and if I'm out with friends, I might have another drink or two to unwind.",false
96,Therapist,It sounds like drinking has been a part of your social routine and a way to relax.,false
96,Client,"Yeah, that's true. And it's also something my family has always done – having wine with dinner.",false
96,Therapist,"So, drinking has been a part of your cultural background and a way to bond with friends and family.",false
96,Client,"Exactly. And I've also heard from friends who have drunk during pregnancy without any issues, and I've seen articles suggesting that the risks might be overstated.",false
96,Therapist,It seems like you're not convinced that there's a clear link between moderate drinking and problems during pregnancy. You feel like you should be able to make your own decisions about what you put in your body.,false
96,Client,"Yeah, I believe in being independent and making my own choices. I don't see why I should have to stop drinking just because I'm pregnant.",false
96,Therapist,"You're looking for evidence-based information to support your decision-making, and you feel like the messages you've received so far are somewhat contradictory.",false
96,Client,"Exactly. I've been doing some research to find information that supports my perspective, so I can feel confident in my choices.",false
96,Therapist,"It's clear that autonomy is important to you, and you want to be able to make informed decisions about your own body and health.",false
96,Client,"Yeah, that's right. And I'm not trying to be difficult; I just want to understand the reasoning behind the recommendations.",false
96,Therapist,Would you be open to exploring the guidelines around low-risk drinking during pregnancy?,false
96,Client,I suppose so.,false
96,Therapist,Let me show you a brochure that outlines the current recommendations.,false
96,Client,"Okay, sure.",false
96,Therapist,"According to these guidelines, there is no safe amount of alcohol to drink during pregnancy. The recommendation is for women to abstain from drinking altogether while pregnant.",false
96,Client,"I've heard this before, but I'm still not convinced. I don't see the evidence that proves it's harmful.",false
96,Therapist,You're looking for a clear explanation of why drinking during pregnancy is problematic. You want to understand the potential risks and consequences.,false
96,Client,"Yeah, exactly. What are the specific concerns, and how do they affect the baby?",false
96,Therapist,Let's take a step back and look at your pregnancy more broadly. Was this a planned pregnancy?,false
96,Client,"Yes, it was.",false
96,Therapist,How important is it to you to have a healthy baby and be a good parent?,false
96,Client,"It's extremely important to me. I want to provide the best possible life for my child and be a responsible, caring parent.",false
96,Therapist,What does being a good parent mean to you?,false
96,Client,"It means being present, providing for their needs, and creating a nurturing environment where they can thrive.",false
96,Therapist,It sounds like protecting and caring for your baby is a top priority for you.,false
96,Client,Absolutely.,false
96,Therapist,"And yet, there seems to be a bit of a disconnect between that goal and the information we've discussed about drinking during pregnancy.",false
96,Client,I guess so. I just don't fully understand the risks or see the evidence that supports complete abstinence.,false
96,Therapist,You're looking for credible sources and up-to-date research to inform your decisions.,false
96,Client,"Yes, that's right. I want to make sure I'm making the best choices for my baby.",false
96,Therapist,"The information I've shared with you is based on the latest research and evidence available. Ultimately, the decision is yours, but I want to support you in making an informed choice.",false
96,Client,"Okay, I appreciate that. It's a lot to take in, but I'm willing to consider the information and make some changes if necessary.",false
96,Therapist,What do you think would be helpful in terms of next steps? How can you start to move away from drinking during your pregnancy?,false
96,Client,"Well, taking this brochure home and discussing it with my partner might be a good starting point. We could also try to reduce our alcohol intake or find alternative ways to relax.",false
96,Therapist,"Those are significant steps, and I'm glad you're open to exploring them. Would you be willing to follow up with me and discuss how things are going?",false
96,Client,"Yes, that would be helpful. Maybe you could also provide some guidance on how to approach this conversation with my partner, since we both have similar views on drinking during pregnancy.",false
96,Therapist,We can definitely work on that together during our next meeting. Thank you for being open and honest with me today.,false
96,Client,Thank you for your help and support.,false
105,Therapist,Can you tell me more about your experience with the exercise since our last conversation?,false
105,Client,"Since we last spoke, I've managed to visit the gym a couple of times.",false
105,Therapist,That's great to hear. You've taken some initial steps towards exercising regularly.,false
105,Client,"Yes, I have.",false
105,Therapist,It's fantastic that you're making progress.,false
105,Client,"Yeah, and I've noticed that my pants fit a bit better now, which is really pleasing for me.",false
105,Therapist,What other changes have you observed besides the improvement in how your clothes fit?,false
105,Client,I generally feel better about myself.,false
105,Therapist,I see.,false
105,Client,My back doesn't hurt as much as it used to.,false
105,Therapist,That's a significant improvement.,false
105,Client,"And, although it's still challenging, I'm trying to be more patient with myself and recognize that it's a process to build up my endurance at the gym.",false
105,Therapist,What do you think would help you build up your endurance and spend more time at the gym?,false
105,Client,I guess just sticking to my routine and avoiding distractions.,false
105,Therapist,I understand.,false
105,Client,"Last week was a bit frustrating because I didn't make it to the gym until Thursday, but I did manage to go again on Saturday.",false
105,Therapist,It's great that you were able to get back on track despite a busy schedule.,false
105,Client,"Yeah, it has been hectic lately, and being at the gym can be discouraging when I see younger people who are more fit and can lift heavier weights.",false
105,Therapist,It sounds like comparing yourself to others at the gym can be challenging for you.,false
105,Client,"When I'm not at the gym, I realize that getting in shape isn't my top priority, but when I'm there, I feel a strong urge to improve my physique.",false
105,Therapist,"For now, it seems like the positive changes you've noticed, such as your pants fitting better, are motivating for you.",false
105,Client,"Yes, that's true.",false
105,Therapist,What other benefits have you experienced since starting to exercise?,false
105,Client,"I've made some small changes to my diet, like eating less junk food and thinking twice before giving in to unhealthy cravings.",false
105,Therapist,How do you think you can continue to make progress with your diet and exercise routine?,false
105,Client,I think seeing more results from my workouts will help me stay motivated and make healthier choices.,false
105,Therapist,"So, when you see the benefits of your hard work, it helps you make better decisions about what you eat.",false
105,Client,"Exactly. If I've worked out hard and lost weight, I'm less likely to indulge in unhealthy foods because I don't want to undo my progress.",false
105,Therapist,"It's about weighing the costs and benefits, literally, in terms of the time and effort you put into your workouts versus the temptation of unhealthy foods.",false
105,Client,"Right, it's about making choices that align with my goals.",false
105,Therapist,And it sounds like you're on the right track so far.,false
105,Client,"Yeah, I'm pleased with how things are going, and I'm glad we had our last conversation because it encouraged me to start exercising again.",false
99,Therapist,"Steve, before we conclude our session today, can you spare a few minutes to discuss your drinking habits with me?",false
99,Client,What would you like to know about my drinking?,false
99,Therapist,"I appreciate you taking the time to fill out our survey earlier. I'd like to review some of the information you provided. It appears that you drink two to three times a week, consuming three or four drinks each time, and your weekly total exceeds six drinks.",false
99,Client,That sounds about right.,false
99,Therapist,Does this drinking pattern seem realistic to you?,false
99,Client,"Yeah, especially on weekends.",false
99,Therapist,I want to express my concern about your level of drinking. Excessive alcohol consumption can exacerbate existing problems or lead to health issues. Have you considered the potential connection between your drinking and the anxiety and insomnia that brought you here today?,false
99,Client,"Honestly, I haven't thought much about it. I don't think I drink excessively, so it's hard for me to believe it's causing my anxiety.",false
99,Therapist,I understand your perspective.,false
99,Client,"Actually, on nights when I don't drink, I have a harder time falling asleep.",false
99,Therapist,"Many people share your experience, believing that alcohol helps them sleep better. However, drinking can have a rebound effect, making you fall asleep faster but wake up in the middle of the night or early morning with difficulty falling back asleep.",false
99,Client,That's interesting. I usually wake up around 2:00 AM on nights when I've had too much to drink.,false
99,Therapist,"I'd like to show you a chart that provides some context for your drinking habits. As a male under 65, the low-risk level is no more than 14 drinks per week and four drinks per day. A standard drink is defined as 12 ounces of beer, five ounces of wine, or one and a half ounces of distilled spirits. Based on your survey responses, you're currently in the high-risk category.",false
99,Client,I had no idea my drinking was that problematic.,false
99,Therapist,"Reviewing this information can provide valuable perspective. On a scale of 1 to 10, how ready are you to make changes to your drinking habits, with 1 being not ready at all and 10 being very ready?",false
99,Client,"I'm not sure. This is all new to me, and I've always considered myself a healthy person. I'd say I'm around a 5.",false
99,Therapist,"That's a good starting point. What prevented you from rating yourself lower, say a 1 or 2?",false
99,Client,"Well, I'm training for a marathon and need to get my sleep back on track. I also don't think of myself as a hazardous drinker or an alcoholic, which is why I chose the middle ground.",false
99,Therapist,"I understand your motivations. You've mentioned that your health is important, especially with your upcoming marathon, and you're surprised to find yourself in the high-risk drinking category.",false
99,Client,"Yes, that's correct.",false
99,Therapist,"Based on our discussion, what are you willing to consider changing about your drinking habits at this point?",false
99,Client,I think it would be reasonable to cut back on my drinking a bit.,false
99,Therapist,What would that look like for you in practical terms?,false
99,Client,Maybe drinking no more than three or four times a week and limiting myself to five or six beers on weekends.,false
99,Therapist,"Sometimes, writing down goals can help solidify them. If you were to set a specific goal for your drinking habits, what would it be?",false
99,Client,"After doing the math, I think I could aim for no more than 18 drinks per week.",false
99,Therapist,"That's an improvement, and I commend you for your willingness to make changes. However, please note that 18 drinks per week still exceeds the low-risk level. My recommendation would be to strive for 14 or fewer drinks per week.",false
99,Client,Thank you.,false
99,Therapist,I'm looking forward to touching base with you next month to see how your progress is going.,false
99,Client,Sounds good.,false
102,Therapist,"Hello Liz, I appreciate you taking the time to meet with me today.",false
102,Client,Sure.,false
102,Therapist,What's been on your mind lately that you'd like to work towards or change?,false
102,Client,"Well, I've been thinking about getting back into working out. It's something I've been considering for a while now, and I know it's important for me to start, but finding the motivation has been a challenge.",false
102,Therapist,It sounds like this is something that's been weighing on your mind. Can you tell me more about what's holding you back from starting?,false
102,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
102,Therapist,"I sense that you're feeling a bit stuck, and it's possible that taking action sooner rather than later could make a big difference for you. What do you think might happen if you were to start making progress on this goal?",false
102,Client,"Well, I don't know if I'm just being lazy about it. I think my schedule is pretty busy, and that's a big part of the challenge.",false
102,Therapist,That makes sense. It can be tough to find time when you have a lot on your plate.,false
102,Client,"Exactly. I just need to figure out how to fit it into my schedule. I might be lacking some motivation, but I think timing is a bigger issue for me right now.",false
102,Therapist,It sounds like finding the right balance is key for you. You've mentioned having a gym membership before - how do you think you could use that resource to start making progress towards your goal?,false
102,Client,"But the thing is, I'm not sure I have three or four times a week to dedicate to working out, or even an hour each time. When you factor in travel time, it ends up being a significant commitment.",false
102,Therapist,I understand that it can feel overwhelming when you consider all the time involved. Can you help me understand what you think would be a more realistic and manageable approach for you?,false
102,Client,"Well, maybe if I could just find a way to make it work with my schedule... but like I said, it's not just the hour of working out, it's the whole process of getting there and back.",false
102,Therapist,It sounds like you're feeling a bit frustrated with the logistics. What do you think would need to happen for you to feel like you could make this work?,false
102,Client,"Well, I'm not sure... I guess I just need to think about it some more.",false
102,Therapist,"Okay, that's a good starting point. I'm looking forward to checking in with you soon and hearing about any progress you've made or thoughts you've had about how to move forward.",false
102,Client,Okay.,false
102,Therapist,"Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me today, Liz.",false
102,Client,Okay.,false
108,Therapist,"I appreciate you taking the time to meet with me today, and I understand from your counselor that you're currently facing a number of challenges. Could you help me better understand what's been going on?",false
108,Client,"Well, I have a two-year-old son, and I'm working full-time as a server while also attending night classes, so it's all just feeling really overwhelming lately.",false
108,Therapist,It sounds like you have a lot on your plate right now. Are you shouldering the responsibilities of parenthood on your own?,false
108,Client,"Yes, I am a single mom.",false
108,Therapist,"I can see how that would add to your stress levels. You're managing sole responsibility for your child, working full-time, and pursuing further education. What do you think would be the most beneficial area for us to focus on during our session today?",false
108,Client,I mentioned to the counselor that childcare is probably my biggest concern at the moment.,false
108,Therapist,Can you tell me more about the challenges you're facing with childcare?,false
108,Client,"My mom usually watches my son, but lately, she's been canceling at short notice, which has caused me to miss work and classes. It's really stressful not knowing if I'll have reliable childcare from one day to the next.",false
108,Therapist,"So, it sounds like the current arrangement with your mom is causing you a significant amount of stress and uncertainty. You've had to miss both work and school due to her last-minute cancellations.",false
108,Client,Exactly.,false
108,Therapist,"Outside of your mom, is there anyone else who might be able to provide support with childcare?",false
108,Client,"I have a sister, but I don't feel comfortable leaving my son in her care. There is one neighbor who helped out once when my mom canceled; she has a child around the same age as mine, and it seemed to work out well.",false
108,Therapist,It's great that you have a potential alternative with this neighbor. She stepped in during a difficult moment and provided the support you needed.,false
108,Client,"Yes, she did, and I think she might be someone I could rely on in the future.",false
108,Therapist,"When your son was in her care, did everything seem okay when you picked him up? Were there any concerns?",false
108,Client,"No, everything seemed fine. He was happy, and I didn't have any issues.",false
108,Therapist,"Let's explore this option further. People like your neighbor can be incredibly valuable as natural support systems. However, affordability is often a significant barrier for many people when it comes to childcare.",false
108,Client,"Yes, that's true.",false
108,Therapist,Have you considered how you might afford regular childcare if you were to pay someone for their services?,false
108,Client,"Honestly, I don't think I could afford traditional daycare or full-time babysitting on my current income.",false
108,Therapist,What are some skills or talents you have that might be leveraged in a creative solution?,false
108,Client,I enjoy cooking and am actually studying culinary arts.,false
108,Therapist,That's a great skill. Would you be open to exploring an arrangement where you prepare meals for your neighbor in exchange for her watching your son?,false
108,Client,"That's an interesting idea. I hadn't thought of something like that, but it might work.",false
108,Therapist,It could be a mutually beneficial arrangement. Are there any other individuals who might be able to offer support with childcare?,false
108,Client,"Unfortunately, there aren't many people I trust enough to leave my son with.",false
108,Therapist,That's completely understandable. Trust is paramount when it comes to your child's care. What about the baby's father? Is he involved at all?,false
108,Client,"No, he hasn't been involved since my son was born.",false
108,Therapist,"Okay, let's focus on the positive lead we have with your neighbor then. If you were able to secure her help, even just one day a week, how do you think that would impact your current situation with your mom?",false
108,Client,I think it could really help alleviate some of the pressure on my mom and make her more reliable.,false
108,Therapist,"So, by reducing the number of days you need childcare from your mom, you believe she might be more consistent and supportive.",false
108,Client,"Yes, that's what I think.",false
108,Therapist,What steps do you see yourself taking next to explore this possibility with your neighbor and potentially discuss it with your mom?,false
108,Client,"First, I'll talk to my neighbor about the idea and see if she's interested. If she is, then I can discuss it with my mom and hopefully find a solution that works for everyone.",false
108,Therapist,That sounds like a solid plan. You mentioned your son is almost three years old. Have you considered enrolling him in a preschool program like Head Start when he turns three?,false
108,Client,"I've heard of it, but I don't know much about the program.",false
108,Therapist,"Head Start is designed for families like yours, offering affordable and high-quality early childhood education. It could be beneficial for your son's development and also provide you with a more structured childcare solution.",false
108,Client,"That sounds really good for my son, and it would definitely help me with childcare.",false
108,Therapist,"I can provide you with more information on local Head Start programs if you're interested. Now, I also noticed from your file that you're working on reducing your smoking and alcohol consumption. How's your progress with that?",false
108,Client,"It's been harder than I expected, but some days I've managed to meet my goals for cutting back on cigarettes and drinks.",false
108,Therapist,"It's great that you're committed to making these changes, even if it's proving challenging. Have you considered the impact of secondhand smoke on your son's health?",false
108,Client,"Yes, I have, which is why I try not to smoke around him and go out onto the balcony if I need to smoke at home.",false
108,Therapist,"It's clear that you're making efforts to prioritize your son's well-being. Let's summarize our discussion so far. We've identified potential solutions for childcare, including your neighbor and exploring Head Start. What do you see as your next steps in moving forward with these options?",false
108,Client,"First, I'll talk to my neighbor about the proposal and then discuss it with my mom if she's interested. I also want to look into the Head Start program because it seems like it could be really beneficial.",false
108,Therapist,That sounds like a good plan. Would you be open to scheduling a follow-up appointment in two weeks to check on your progress and see if there's anything else we can do to support you?,false
108,Client,"Okay, that sounds good.",false
108,Therapist,"Great, I'll look forward to seeing you then. Thank you again for coming in today and sharing your situation with me.",false
108,Client,"Thanks, it was helpful talking through everything.",false
111,Therapist,"Hello Katie, I'm Beth, a nurse working with Nurse Practitioner Mrs. Smith. May I take a moment to speak with you?",false
111,Client,"Yes, that's fine. What's this about?",false
111,Therapist,"While you were waiting to see Mrs. Smith, you completed a healthy habits questionnaire, which included some questions about your marijuana use. Would you be willing to discuss how marijuana fits into your life?",false
111,Client,Sure.,false
111,Therapist,I noticed you reported using marijuana regularly. Can you help me understand its role in your life and how it affects you?,false
111,Client,"Well, now that it's decriminalized in Virginia, I don't think it's a big deal. Am I in trouble or something?",false
111,Therapist,"Not at all. I'm here to support you, not to judge. Can you tell me more about how marijuana helps you and how you use it?",false
111,Client,It's just something I do a couple of times a week to unwind.,false
111,Therapist,"So, marijuana seems to be a way for you to relax and manage stress. Is that correct?",false
111,Client,"Yeah, I'm on an academic scholarship and part of the debate team, so there's a lot of pressure to perform well.",false
111,Therapist,It sounds like being a successful student with many responsibilities can be overwhelming at times. How do you feel about your situation?,false
111,Client,"Honestly, I'm the first in my family to attend college, and it feels like a lot to handle.",false
111,Therapist,"You've achieved great academic success, but the transition to college has been challenging for you. Is that right?",false
111,Client,"Yes, I've always been an anxious person, and marijuana helps me calm down. Am I in trouble?",false
111,Therapist,"Katie, I want to reassure you again that you're not in trouble. My goal is to support you. Besides helping you relax, what are some other positive aspects of using marijuana for you?",false
111,Client,"When I'm with my peers and we're using it together, I feel like I fit in more.",false
111,Therapist,"So, using marijuana in social situations helps you feel more at ease with your friends and like you belong?",false
111,Client,"I guess so, but it's more like I'm trying to fit in by doing what they do.",false
111,Therapist,How effective do you think using marijuana is in helping you feel more comfortable around your peers?,false
111,Client,"To be honest, I'm not sure it's really working.",false
111,Therapist,It seems that using marijuana to try to fit in with your friends isn't entirely successful and might even add to your stress. What are some downsides to smoking marijuana for you?,false
111,Client,"Well, it helps me relax, but I worry about getting caught, and my parents would be upset if they found out.",false
111,Therapist,"So, using marijuana not only doesn't make you feel more comfortable socially but also increases your anxiety due to the fear of legal consequences and your family's disapproval?",false
111,Client,"Yes, that's right.",false
111,Therapist,Are there any other negative aspects of smoking marijuana that come to mind for you?,false
111,Client,"It's also embarrassing because I don't have the money to buy it myself, so I usually get it from my roommate.",false
111,Therapist,Using marijuana reminds you of your financial situation and makes you feel uncomfortable about having to rely on others for it. Is that correct?,false
111,Client,Yes.,false
111,Therapist,"Katie, it seems like using marijuana has both some benefits and significant drawbacks for you, including stress about fitting in, legal concerns, and financial issues. What are your thoughts on what you might want to do about your marijuana use?",false
111,Client,"I'm not sure, but when you put it that way, it doesn't seem like the best habit to have.",false
111,Therapist,Would you be open to a suggestion from me?,false
111,Client,Okay.,false
111,Therapist,You mentioned earlier that you've struggled with anxiety. Have you ever considered speaking with a counselor about it?,false
111,Client,"No, my family doesn't really do that sort of thing.",false
111,Therapist,Can you tell me more about why counseling isn't something your family typically considers?,false
111,Client,"It's just not seen as something for people like us, and we couldn't afford it anyway.",false
111,Therapist,"So, in your family, counseling is viewed as something only needed by people with severe issues, and there's also a concern about the cost. Is that right?",false
111,Client,"Yes, that's correct.",false
111,Therapist,"Many students come to college and face significant stress and anxiety, but they find that talking to our counselors and learning specific skills to manage anxiety can be very helpful. Would you be interested in exploring this option?",false
111,Client,I'm not sure.,false
111,Therapist,What makes you hesitant about seeking counseling?,false
111,Client,Mostly the cost and my parents' disapproval.,false
111,Therapist,"Our counseling services are free, and we're obligated to protect your privacy, meaning we wouldn't inform your parents. There are some exceptions to this rule, primarily if we're concerned about your safety.",false
111,Client,You mean like if someone was suicidal?,false
111,Therapist,"Exactly. If there were concerns about suicide or harm to oneself or others, that would be an exception.",false
111,Client,I would never do something like that.,false
111,Therapist,"If you decide to see a counselor, we can discuss the specifics of our privacy policies further. But generally, you wouldn't need to worry about us sharing information with your parents.",false
111,Client,"Okay, I'll think about it.",false
111,Therapist,"As you're leaving, I could walk with you and show you where our counseling center is located. I could even introduce you to one of the counselors if you'd like.",false
111,Client,Do I have to go there right now?,false
111,Therapist,"No, not at all. I just wanted to make sure you know about the resources available here at the college and make it easy for you to access them if you decide you're interested.",false
111,Client,"Okay, sure. Let's go.",false
114,Therapist,"To ensure I understand correctly, can you confirm the details outlined in the Minnesota State Mankato security report, which states you were stopped on Stadium Road last Friday for driving under the influence and subsequently transported to detox, and also lists your age as 20? Could you share some context leading up to this incident?",false
114,Client,"Yeah, that sounds about right. I was drinking with friends at their house to watch a game, and things got out of hand when the Vikings started losing badly. We ended up drinking more than planned, and when it was time to leave, I couldn't find a ride, so I decided to drive myself home.",false
114,Therapist,"Just to clarify, it seems that your decision to drink more was influenced by the game's outcome, and when you couldn't secure a ride, you opted to drive. Is that an accurate summary of what happened?",false
114,Client,"Exactly. I'm just a normal college kid who likes to have fun with friends. It wasn't some big party; we were just hanging out, and things didn't go as planned.",false
114,Therapist,"I understand that your intention was to enjoy the game with friends, but perhaps you didn't fully consider the potential risks of underage drinking since you were at a friend's house rather than a large party. You did try to be responsible by looking for a ride home.",false
114,Client,"Yeah, I tried to be safe. I even attempted to call my friend's roommate for a ride, but it didn't work out, and I ended up getting in trouble anyway.",false
114,Therapist,"Dylan, considering what brought you here today, what do you think is the core issue?",false
114,Client,"Honestly, I'm not sure if I have a drinking problem or just a problem with getting caught. My friends drink a lot too, but they never seem to get in trouble, which makes me wonder if it's just bad luck.",false
114,Therapist,"It sounds like you attribute your situation to bad luck. If that's the case and you don't make any changes, what potential consequences might you face?",false
114,Client,"Probably more issues with the police and school, which would be really tough for me since I don't have the time or money to deal with those problems.",false
114,Therapist,"How important is it for you to avoid future problems with law enforcement and academic issues, Dylan?",false
114,Client,"It's extremely important. The experience of going to detox was awful, and I don't want to go through that again. Plus, my dad said if I get suspended, I'll have to work on my uncle's farm in Iowa, which would ruin my social life and keep me from seeing friends.",false
114,Therapist,What steps are you willing to take to prevent going back to detox and facing academic suspension?,false
114,Client,"I guess the easiest thing would be to cut back on drinking and avoid situations that might get me into trouble. So, probably just drink less.",false
114,Therapist,"On a scale of 1 to 10, how confident do you feel about following through with this plan, with 10 being very confident?",false
114,Client,Maybe around a six. I'm somewhat confident but not entirely sure.,false
114,Therapist,What could you do to increase your confidence from a six to a seven or eight?,false
114,Client,"Well, maybe if I limit where I drink, like sticking to my apartment, I'd reduce the risk of driving under the influence. Or, if I go to parties, waiting until I'm 21 to drink could help. Finding activities that don't involve drinking could also be beneficial.",false
114,Therapist,How might your life improve if you successfully make these changes?,false
114,Client,"I think I'd avoid being hungover all the time, which would help me attend my early morning classes without sleeping through them or missing important material. If I reprioritize what's important to me, I believe I could succeed academically, like I did in high school with a 3.5 GPA.",false
114,Therapist,"College is about making choices. Can you discuss how your beliefs and values influence your decision-making, especially regarding drinking, and how these align with your future plans?",false
114,Client,"Education is really important to me and my family. My goal is to become an international journalist. If I prioritize what's truly important and cut back on drinking, I won't disappoint my parents, and I'll be able to get a good education.",false
114,Therapist,Thank you for participating today. Your sanction includes university disciplinary probation and attending an alcohol education seminar at a cost of $150.,false
114,Client,"Okay, when is the seminar scheduled?",false
120,Therapist,"I'm glad we were able to clarify things, and I'm hopeful that you'll start feeling better over the next few days.",false
120,Client,"Thank you so much, doctor; I appreciate your help, and I plan to take it easy for a couple of days.",false
120,Therapist,"Since we have a few minutes left, I'd like to discuss another important topic with you - your blood pressure and weight, which have been increasing over the past few years. Would you be open to exploring this further and potentially finding some useful strategies together?",false
120,Client,"Yeah, that's okay, I guess. I'm aware that my weight is a problem, but despite trying to lose it, I always seem to gain it back, and I'm not sure what to do about it.",false
120,Therapist,"I understand how frustrating managing weight can be. Perhaps we can work together to find a way forward, and I'll be here to support you through the challenges.",false
120,Client,"Okay, thank you, doctor; I appreciate your help, but my concern is that with work being so busy and the kids taking up a lot of my time, I'm not sure how I can possibly lose weight now.",false
120,Therapist,"That's completely understandable. We don't need to figure everything out today, especially given your busy schedule. Maybe we can identify something small that fits reasonably into your life, and then take further steps when you're ready.",false
120,Client,"Okay, that sounds great; so what would be a good starting point?",false
120,Therapist,"Let's consider the importance of physical activity in managing weight and overall health. It has numerous benefits, including improving joint health, reducing stress, and aiding in weight management. Can we discuss ways to incorporate more activity into your daily life?",false
120,Client,"I knew you'd suggest that, but I don't have time for an hour at the gym every day.",false
120,Therapist,"I understand that finding large blocks of time can be difficult. However, any amount of physical activity, regardless of type, can be beneficial. What are some activities that you enjoy doing?",false
120,Client,I like walking.,false
120,Therapist,Walking is excellent exercise; it's something we both enjoy.,false
120,Client,But isn't walking too mild to make a significant difference in weight loss?,false
120,Therapist,"Even short periods of walking can have significant health benefits, and it's an activity that can be done anywhere, without needing to go to a gym.",false
120,Client,"That sounds good; actually, I have some time before I need to return to work, and I noticed a nice park on the way here - maybe I'll take a short walk after this appointment.",false
120,Therapist,That sounds like a great idea.,false
120,Client,"You know, I used to really love dancing, but I haven't done it in a long time.",false
120,Therapist,"Dancing is a fantastic form of exercise, especially since it's something you enjoy.",false
120,Client,And my family would be very supportive if I could find a place to dance.,false
120,Therapist,It's great that your family is so supportive; perhaps there's a local dance class or dance fitness program at a gym near you.,false
120,Client,"Yeah, I'd really like to try that.",false
120,Therapist,Would you be interested in looking into this further and giving it a shot?,false
120,Client,"Actually, yes, I'm kind of excited about it; what else can we consider?",false
120,Therapist,"Small changes can add up over time. For example, taking the stairs instead of the elevator or parking a bit further from the store entrance can increase your daily movement.",false
120,Client,"Mm-hmm, I can definitely do that.",false
120,Therapist,"Let's start with these small steps and plan to follow up in a few weeks to see how it's going, and then we can discuss additional strategies if needed.",false
120,Client,"Diet, the D word.",false
120,Therapist,"Not necessarily; while what we eat is important for weight and health, we can focus on finding small, manageable changes that fit into your life and that you feel good about.",false
120,Client,"Yeah, I like that approach; okay, I'll make an appointment and start dancing right away, doc.",false
120,Therapist,That's great; I'll see you soon.,false
117,Therapist,"Hello again, it's nice to see you. Can you tell me what brings you here today, what's been on your mind lately?",false
117,Client,I'm just really tired of my drinking habits. I feel like I've been drinking too much and I thought it would be helpful to talk to someone about it.,false
117,Therapist,"So, you're feeling like your drinking is becoming a problem for you right now?",false
117,Client,"Yeah, over the last six months, it's gotten worse.",false
117,Therapist,What makes you think that it's worsened over this time period?,false
117,Client,"Well, after my breakup, I started going out more to meet new people, and I've been drinking a lot on Fridays and Saturdays.",false
117,Therapist,I understand.,false
117,Client,"And lately, I've also been drinking during the week, which isn't like me.",false
117,Therapist,"Okay, so it sounds like you've noticed an increase in your drinking over the past six months, especially since you started going out to meet new people.",false
117,Client,"Yeah, that's right.",false
117,Therapist,Can you help me understand what might be driving this behavior?,false
117,Client,"Honestly, I just feel really uncomfortable talking to guys when I'm sober. Drinking helps me relax.",false
117,Therapist,"So, the drinking is helping you feel more at ease in social situations, particularly when meeting new people?",false
117,Client,"Yeah, definitely.",false
117,Therapist,"It's interesting that you mention it's helping you calm your nerves, but at the same time, you're not really meeting people and you're ending up with hangovers.",false
117,Client,"Yeah, exactly. It's not even working like I want it to.",false
117,Therapist,"So, it seems like there are two sides to this coin - on one hand, drinking helps you feel more comfortable, but on the other hand, it's not leading to the outcomes you want and it's causing problems.",false
117,Client,"Yeah, that's right.",false
117,Therapist,What would you like to achieve or change given your current situation?,false
117,Client,"I just want to stop drinking so much, especially during the week.",false
117,Therapist,"Okay, so you're noticing that your drinking is having a negative impact on other areas of your life, such as your eating habits and exercise routine.",false
117,Client,"Yeah, I'm not taking care of myself like I used to.",false
117,Therapist,"It sounds like you want to cut back on your drinking, but you also don't want to give it up completely because it has some social benefits for you.",false
117,Client,"Exactly. I feel like if I stopped drinking altogether, I wouldn't have a social life.",false
117,Therapist,"So, you're looking for a balance - you want to reduce your drinking, but still be able to enjoy social situations with your friends.",false
117,Client,"Yeah, that's right.",false
117,Therapist,Have you ever tried to cut back on your drinking before?,false
117,Client,"No, this is the first time I've really thought about it.",false
117,Therapist,"Okay, so this is a new experience for you. Can you help me understand what makes you want to cut back now?",false
117,Client,I guess it's just that my circumstances have changed - I'm single now and my friends are drinking more.,false
117,Therapist,"Okay, got it. So, you're recognizing that your drinking has increased due to these changes in your life.",false
117,Client,"Yeah, and I don't want it to get any worse.",false
117,Therapist,"On a scale of 0 to 100, how important is it for you to cut back on your drinking?",false
117,Client,"I'd say 80. That's why I'm here, because I feel like I need to do something about it.",false
117,Therapist,"Okay, that's a pretty high number. What makes you choose 80 over a lower number?",false
117,Client,I just feel like it's gotten out of control and I don't want it to get any worse.,false
117,Therapist,"So, you're feeling a sense of urgency about addressing your drinking habits.",false
117,Client,"Yeah, exactly.",false
117,Therapist,It sounds like you're recognizing that your drinking has had negative impacts on your lifestyle and you're ready to make a change.,false
117,Client,"Yeah, that's right.",false
117,Therapist,What do you think your next step should be?,false
117,Client,I guess that's why I'm here - to figure out how to cut back on my drinking.,false
117,Therapist,"Okay, so you're thinking about reducing your drinking during the week and being more mindful of it on weekends.",false
117,Client,"Yeah, that sounds like a good plan.",false
117,Therapist,"So, you're considering setting a goal to keep weekdays free of alcohol - how does that sound to you?",false
117,Client,That sounds like a great first step.,false
117,Therapist,How committed do you feel to achieving this goal?,false
117,Client,I'm definitely going to do it. Just talking about it makes me realize how much I need to make a change.,false
117,Therapist,That's great to hear - it sounds like you're motivated to turn things around.,false
117,Client,"Yeah, I am. I just need to get back into my routine and start taking care of myself again.",false
126,Therapist,"Hello Kaylie, I'm glad you're here to pick up your prescription today. Can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in?",false
126,Client,"Yeah, my doctor said he called something in for me.",false
126,Therapist,I see that it's a cholesterol statin. Are you familiar with how to take this medication?,false
126,Client,"No, not really, I don't know much about it.",false
126,Therapist,"That's okay, I'm here to help. You'll be taking one tablet once a day. Did your doctor mention anything about potential side effects?",false
126,Client,"No, he didn't say anything about that.",false
126,Therapist,"Some common side effects can include nausea, vomiting, and headaches. There are also some more severe side effects, such as dermatomyositis or liver failure, that you should be aware of. If you experience any of these, please don't hesitate to reach out to your doctor.",false
126,Client,"Okay, I'll keep that in mind.",false
126,Therapist,Can you tell me a little bit about why you're taking this medication? What did your doctor say about your condition?,false
126,Client,"Um, he said it was for my dyslipidemia, but I'm not really sure what that means.",false
126,Therapist,"That's okay, I'm here to help clarify things for you. Dyslipidemia refers to high cholesterol levels in your blood. This medication will help lower those levels and reduce your risk of heart disease.",false
126,Client,"Oh, okay, that makes sense.",false
126,Therapist,Do you have any questions for me about your medication or how to take it?,false
126,Client,"No, I don't think so.",false
126,Therapist,"Alright, well, if you do have any questions later, don't hesitate to reach out. Have a great day, Kaylie.",false
126,Client,"Thanks, you too.",false
126,Therapist,"Hello Kaylie, I'm Lori, the pharmacist here at Bulldog Pharmacy. I see that you have a new prescription for cholesterol statin 20. Can you spare a minute to talk about it?",false
126,Client,"Sure, I'm just getting a few groceries.",false
126,Therapist,What did your doctor tell you about why you're taking this medication?,false
126,Client,"He said I had a blood test and that my cholesterol levels were high, so I should start taking this.",false
126,Therapist,That's right. This medication will help lower your cholesterol levels and reduce your risk of heart disease. How did your doctor instruct you to take the medication?,false
126,Client,"He didn't really give me any instructions, he just called it in.",false
126,Therapist,"Okay, no problem. You'll be taking one tablet of cholesterol statin 20 once a day, with or without food. When do you usually take your medications?",false
126,Client,"I take them all right before bed, so I guess I could take it then.",false
126,Therapist,"That's perfect. This medication works best when taken at night, and it's essential to take it every day. Where do you store your medications?",false
126,Client,"In my nightstand, right by my bed.",false
126,Therapist,Do you have any children in the house who might accidentally get into your medications?,false
126,Client,"No, I don't have any kids.",false
126,Therapist,"Alright, that's good to know. Medications are best stored away from light, heat, and moisture. What did your doctor say about potential side effects?",false
126,Client,He didn't mention anything about that.,false
126,Therapist,"This medication is usually well-tolerated, but you might experience some mild muscle aches or pains. If they seem severe, please reach out to your doctor. Also, be aware that this medication can interact with other medications or over-the-counter products.",false
126,Client,"Okay, got it.",false
126,Therapist,"Just to make sure we're on the same page, can you repeat back to me how you'll be taking this medication?",false
126,Client,"Yeah, I'll take one tablet at night with my other medications, and I'll switch to orange juice instead of grapefruit juice.",false
126,Therapist,"That's great, Kaylie. Do you have any questions for me about your medication or how to take it?",false
126,Client,"No, I think you've answered all my questions, thank you.",false
126,Therapist,"You're welcome, Kaylie. I've put your prescription on auto-fill, so it will be ready at the same time every month. If you have any questions later, don't hesitate to reach out.",false
126,Client,"Thanks, I appreciate that.",false
123,Therapist,"I've completed your examination, and I have both positive and concerning findings to share with you. The good news is that you don't have any cavities.",false
123,Client,That's great to hear.,false
123,Therapist,"However, I am concerned about some irritation I've noticed in your mouth, particularly on the roof of your mouth, which appears to be consistent with tobacco use. You had indicated on your form that you're not a tobacco user, so I'm wondering if there might be something else at play here.",false
123,Client,I don't smoke cigarettes.,false
123,Therapist,"I understand. The irritation I'm seeing, especially the white-colored patches and red spots on the roof of your mouth, suggests that there may be some tissue damage occurring, which could lead to more severe oral health issues if not addressed. This condition is often associated with tobacco use. Could you be using other forms of tobacco, such as a pipe or cigars?",false
123,Client,"Well, I've never smoked cigarettes, but when I go out with friends to lounges, we sometimes receive gifts, including mini cigars like Swisher Sweets in flavors like peach and grape.",false
123,Therapist,"It's not uncommon for people to underestimate the risks associated with flavored tobacco products. However, it's essential to understand that these products can still cause significant harm to your health.",false
123,Client,Really? I thought they were harmless because they're small and flavored.,false
123,Therapist,"Despite their appearance and flavoring, these products contain tobacco and can lead to serious health issues, including lung cancer, oral cancer, and emphysema.",false
123,Client,I only use them occasionally to relax when I'm out with friends; it's not a daily habit for me.,false
123,Therapist,"While it's good that you're not using them frequently, the damage to your mouth is still a concern. Have you considered quitting?",false
123,Client,"Honestly, I didn't think of it as a significant issue since I only use them socially.",false
123,Therapist,"Can you help me understand what you mean by ""I didn't really know I'd started""?",false
123,Client,I thought of it more like social drinking – something I do occasionally when out with friends.,false
123,Therapist,"Now that we've discussed the potential risks, are you considering quitting?",false
123,Client,Maybe; I'll have to think about it.,false
123,Therapist,What aspects of this would you like to think through further? We've discussed the potential health consequences and the fact that you don't use them regularly.,false
123,Client,"It's something I do to relax, and I don't see it as a significant part of my daily life, so I might consider cutting back.",false
123,Therapist,"Cutting back is a start, but quitting altogether would allow your mouth to heal and reduce your risk of developing more severe health issues. As long as you continue using these products, you're putting yourself at risk.",false
123,Client,"I'm not convinced that what you're telling me is entirely accurate, and I believe it's my choice what I do.",false
123,Therapist,"I understand that you feel it's your decision, but I want to emphasize the potential consequences of continuing to use tobacco products, including damage to your mouth and teeth. There are many negative effects associated with any form of tobacco use.",false
123,Client,I'll think about what you've said.,false
123,Therapist,"I appreciate your willingness to consider this information, and I hope you'll think carefully about the potential risks. This is something we'll continue to discuss in our future conversations because it's a critical aspect of your health.",false
132,Therapist,"Hello again, Mr. Green. It's great to see you. I recall we discussed your health results last week, including your impaired glucose tolerance and concerns about type 2 diabetes, as well as your elevated blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Today, let's explore some strategies that could help improve your situation. How have you been doing since our last meeting?",false
132,Client,"I'm a bit apprehensive, thinking you might lecture me about my lifestyle choices and tell me to give up things I enjoy.",false
132,Therapist,"I want to assure you that's not my approach. You're in control of your own health, and it's up to you to decide what changes you'd like to make.",false
132,Client,The doctor mentioned I'll need to take medication for the rest of my life.,false
132,Therapist,It sounds like you have some reservations about that.,false
132,Client,"Although I feel fine now, the doctor said it could be lifesaving.",false
132,Therapist,"In addition to medication, there are many lifestyle changes that can positively impact your health. We can discuss options like smoking cessation, diet, exercise, and weight loss. Let's take it one step at a time and see how you feel as we progress.",false
132,Client,What would you recommend I start with?,false
132,Therapist,"The decision is yours, but where would you like to begin?",false
132,Client,Perhaps you could suggest where I should start.,false
132,Therapist,"While I can offer guidance and information, I think you have a good understanding of your situation. You might already know what I would suggest.",false
132,Client,"I'm guessing you'd advise me to stop smoking, lose weight, and exercise more, right?",false
132,Therapist,"That's correct. Quitting smoking would have a significant impact, and losing weight would also be beneficial for your blood pressure, cholesterol, and diabetes risk. What are your thoughts on those suggestions?",false
132,Client,"I'd love to lose weight, but it's hard to give up the things I enjoy.",false
132,Therapist,"It can be challenging to know where to start, can't it?",false
132,Client,"I feel like I should make some changes, but I'm not sure if I should.",false
132,Therapist,How important is it for you to lose weight and improve your health?,false
132,Client,"I'd like to see my children settled and my grandchildren grow up, and I want to be a good role model for them.",false
132,Therapist,"So, your family's well-being is a significant motivator for you?",false
132,Client,"Yes, I want to be there for them without being a burden.",false
132,Therapist,Where do you think you could start making some positive changes?,false
132,Client,"Lately, I've been thinking about my family a lot, and I want to take care of myself for their sake. I need to make some improvements to my health.",false
132,Therapist,What's the first step you think you might take?,false
132,Client,"To start, I could cut down on my drinking, which contributes to my weight and blood pressure.",false
132,Therapist,That would be a great place to begin.,false
132,Client,"Actually, I think I'll try to cut out alcohol altogether. My wife says I drink too much on weekends.",false
132,Therapist,It sounds like you have a supportive partner.,false
132,Client,And I could also cut out the crisps and pies at work.,false
132,Therapist,How do you plan to manage your hunger at work instead?,false
132,Client,I'll start having soup for lunch. A big bowl of soup would be a much better choice than two pies.,false
132,Therapist,A large bowl of vegetable soup could even count as one or two of your daily servings of fruits and vegetables. That's a great starting point. Are there any other changes you're considering?,false
132,Client,"I've already stopped adding salt to my food, which the doctor said would help with my blood pressure.",false
132,Therapist,That's a good start. Reducing salt intake can also help with bone health by preventing calcium loss.,false
132,Client,"I didn't know that. It's good to know, and I'll share it with my wife, who still uses a lot of salt and has a family history of osteoporosis.",false
132,Therapist,"Perhaps you can encourage her to reduce her salt intake as well. I think you've made an excellent start, Mr. Green. You're aware of what you need to do and have some solid plans in place. We can discuss smoking and exercise further when you're ready.",false
132,Client,"If I stick to my plan of cutting out the pies, crisps, and alcohol, I feel like I'm making progress, but let's take it one step at a time and see how it goes.",false
132,Therapist,That sounds like a great approach. Shall we schedule our next meeting for the same time next week?,false
132,Client,That works for me.,false
132,Therapist,Excellent. I wish you all the best.,false
132,Client,"Thank you, and you too.",false
4,Therapist,"Hello Emily, it's great to see you again after some time.",false
4,Client,"Hi, nice to be here.",false
4,Therapist,I've noticed something new about you.,false
4,Client,"Oh, you mean my lip piercing?",false
4,Therapist,"Yes, the lip piercing. How long have you had it?",false
4,Client,About a month now.,false
4,Therapist,That's interesting. What inspired you to get a lip piercing?,false
4,Client,"Honestly, I just felt like trying something different and standing out in a way.",false
4,Therapist,"It does look nice on you. As your dentist, I have some concerns about oral piercings and their potential impact on teeth and gums. Have you heard anything about this?",false
4,Client,"Not really, but I imagine it could affect my gums or teeth somehow.",false
4,Therapist,"You do have a beautiful smile, and I've always appreciated the care you take with your teeth.",false
4,Client,"Thanks, that's kind of you to say.",false
4,Therapist,"With some patients who have oral piercings, I've seen gum erosion near the front. And another issue is chipped teeth from contact with the piercing. What are your thoughts on these potential risks?",false
4,Client,"I definitely don't want the piercing to damage my teeth, especially since I already have low gums and need to be diligent about flossing.",false
4,Therapist,"Flossing is an important habit for you. If you started noticing problems with your teeth due to the piercing, what would make you consider removing it?",false
4,Client,Probably if I saw actual signs of damage or issues arising from it.,false
4,Therapist,"That makes sense. Since you've only had it for a short time and there are no current problems, we can monitor the situation.",false
4,Client,"Yeah, that sounds like a good plan. If I notice any real problems, I might reconsider having the piercing.",false
4,Therapist,"It's great that you're open to monitoring its effects. You want your teeth to last, and that's a priority for you.",false
4,Client,"Exactly, my teeth are important to me, and I hope they'll last forever.",false
4,Therapist,"Well said, Emily. The piercing may be temporary, but your teeth are a long-term investment in your health.",false
4,Client,"Yeah, that's true.",false
4,Therapist,"Thanks for discussing this with me. Before we proceed with the exam, let's touch base on your flossing routine again.",false
4,Client,"Okay, sounds good.",false
7,Therapist,"I understand we've established that you sprained your ankle yesterday, and I'm curious to hear more about what led up to the accident. Can you walk me through what happened?",false
7,Client,"It's pretty embarrassing, but I was at a 90s-themed pub crawl last night, and after having a few drinks, I tried to catch up with my friends by jumping off the bus stairs while wearing stilettos, which didn't end well.",false
7,Therapist,It sounds like the evening was quite eventful.,false
7,Client,"Yeah, it was a lot of fun, but the rest of the night was pretty subdued after that.",false
7,Therapist,I can imagine it would be challenging to continue dancing with an injured ankle. I'm wondering if you'd be open to exploring your drinking habits and how they might impact your daily life.,false
7,Client,"Sure, as long as we don't focus too much on vodka right now, since I'm still feeling a bit rough from last night.",false
7,Therapist,"You're still experiencing some aftereffects from the previous night, is that correct?",false
7,Client,"A little bit, yeah.",false
7,Therapist,It's understandable that you'd be feeling that way after such a wild night.,false
7,Client,"Well, it's just what happens when you go out, I guess.",false
7,Therapist,Can you tell me more about your typical drinking habits during the week? How often do you usually have a drink?,false
7,Client,"Um, well, my friends and I like to party on weekends, and as university students, it's pretty normal for us to have a few drinks. Sometimes I'll also have a beer or two after a long day at the library.",false
7,Therapist,"So drinking is a regular part of your social life, but do you ever worry that it might be affecting you in some way?",false
7,Client,"No, not really. I think it's just what most students do.",false
7,Therapist,"You don't seem too concerned about your drinking habits right now, and you feel like it's just part of the university experience?",false
7,Client,"Yeah, exactly.",false
7,Therapist,Would you be willing to take a look at some guidelines for low-risk drinking and see how your habits compare?,false
7,Client,"Yeah, sure, I'm open to that.",false
7,Therapist,"Let's take a quick look at these guidelines. For women, the recommended limit is about 10 drinks per week, with no more than two drinks per day.",false
7,Client,"Oh, really? I had no idea.",false
7,Therapist,Where do you think you fall in relation to those guidelines?,false
7,Client,"Honestly, I'd say I'm probably over that limit, especially with midterms coming up and using drinking as a way to cope with stress.",false
7,Therapist,It sounds like drinking has become a way for you to manage stress. Has that been the case for a while now?,false
7,Client,"Yeah, I guess so.",false
7,Therapist,Does it concern you at all that you might be relying on drinking as a coping mechanism?,false
7,Client,"Um, I mean, the recommended limit seems pretty low to me, considering my tolerance, but I suppose it's something to think about.",false
7,Therapist,"You've built up a tolerance over time, which can be concerning. Do you think there are any reasons why you might want to reduce your drinking to within the recommended limits?",false
7,Client,"Uh, well, health reasons, I guess. I don't feel great right now, and I'm more productive when I'm not hungover.",false
7,Therapist,"So you can see some benefits to reducing your drinking, such as improved productivity and better overall health?",false
7,Client,"Yeah, that's true.",false
7,Therapist,"Would you be willing to explore this further with me at another time, maybe when you're feeling a bit better?",false
7,Client,"Yeah, that sounds good. Maybe when I haven't just gone out and sprained my ankle.",false
7,Therapist,I'd like to schedule a follow-up appointment for later this week or early next week to discuss this further and explore some strategies for reducing your drinking. Would that work for you?,false
7,Client,"Sure, just not on a Saturday morning, please.",false
7,Therapist,That's perfectly fine with me.,false
7,Client,"Okay, sounds good.",false
7,Therapist,Thank you for being open and honest with me today.,false
7,Client,"Yeah, no problem.",false
10,Therapist,"Hello, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you here today?",false
10,Client,Yeah.,false
10,Therapist,What motivated you to come in for this session?,false
10,Client,"Well, I'm supposed to learn how to manage my diabetes after being recently diagnosed.",false
10,Therapist,I understand. It sounds like your doctor has expressed some concerns about your blood glucose levels being quite high.,false
10,Client,"Yes, that's what the doctor said. She emphasized the seriousness of the situation and the potential risks, such as losing eyesight or having problems with my feet, which really scared me. I'm trying to figure out how to manage all of this, but it feels overwhelming.",false
10,Therapist,"It can be daunting to hear about the potential complications. To get your diabetes under control, we'll need to work on developing a comprehensive plan that includes medication, dietary changes, weight loss, and exercise.",false
10,Client,"That sounds like a lot to take on, and I'm unsure if I can make all those changes. The thought of not being able to do everything and facing the consequences is also worrying me.",false
10,Therapist,It's understandable to feel that way. The potential consequences of unmanaged diabetes can be significant.,false
10,Client,(sighs),false
10,Therapist,"Let's start by breaking down what we need to do to get your diabetes under control, given your current numbers.",false
10,Client,"Well, I'm not sure where to begin or if I can really do everything that's being asked of me.",false
16,Therapist,"Rick, let's take a moment to reflect on your current living situation with Tristan. Considering the support system you have in place, including your parents and this program, what are your thoughts on the advantages and disadvantages of continuing to live with him?",false
16,Client,"It's a convenient location, close to work, and I enjoy living with a friend.",false
16,Therapist,"That's helpful to acknowledge. In terms of having a supportive environment that will aid in making positive changes, how do you think your current living situation aligns with those needs?",false
16,Client,"Yes, that's something I've been considering.",false
16,Therapist,Can you elaborate on your thoughts regarding the support you need and how your living situation might impact that?,false
16,Client,"The challenge is, I'm not sure if staying with Tristan is the best decision for me, given the changes I'm trying to make.",false
16,Therapist,I understand.,false
16,Client,"Tristan is a good flatmate, but we're at different stages in our lives, and I don't expect him to alter his lifestyle to accommodate my goals.",false
16,Therapist,That's a fair point.,false
16,Client,"However, the idea of moving in with my aunt and uncle is not entirely appealing to me either.",false
16,Therapist,"Let's explore this further. How much does Tristan understand about the changes you're trying to make, and what kind of support has he offered?",false
16,Client,"I've had open conversations with him, and he's expressed his willingness to support me, but I'm aware that he's in a different place in his life.",false
16,Therapist,I see.,false
16,Client,"He doesn't have the same responsibilities as me, particularly when it comes to children.",false
16,Therapist,Right.,false
16,Client,"While he's a good friend, I'm not sure he fully grasps what these changes mean to me.",false
16,Therapist,Okay. What are some of the benefits and drawbacks you see in moving in with your aunt and uncle?,false
16,Client,"On the positive side, I would have access to good food and support from my family. However, I'm concerned about losing my independence and autonomy.",false
16,Therapist,"In considering your desire for freedom and self-management, how do you think that will intersect with your goals of rebuilding relationships with your whānau and your children?",false
16,Client,"If having more freedom means jeopardizing my relationship with my kids, then it's not worth it. I'm worried that moving in with family could lead to them taking control, even if their intentions are good.",false
16,Therapist,I understand your concerns.,false
16,Client,"Ultimately, I'm willing to do whatever it takes to reunite with my children.",false
13,Therapist,"Hello, Mrs. Smith. I'd like to take a moment to discuss the plan for today's appointment, which includes administering some vaccines to Lilly.",false
13,Client,I'm not sure I'm entirely comfortable with that. I've been doing some reading lately and have some concerns about vaccines.,false
13,Therapist,I'd love to hear more about what you've been reading and how it's impacting your thoughts on vaccinating Lilly.,false
13,Client,"Well, from what I understand, it seems like allowing children to develop immunity naturally might be a better approach for their overall health.",false
13,Therapist,"So, it sounds like you're considering the potential benefits of natural immunity versus vaccine-induced immunity for Lilly. Can you help me understand what's driving that thought process?",false
13,Client,"Yes, I mean, I had chickenpox as a kid and now I'm immune, so it seems like that could be a more natural way for her to develop immunity as well.",false
13,Therapist,"That's a great point. Having chickenpox as a child does provide natural immunity, which can be beneficial. May I offer some additional information about the vaccines we're considering for Lilly today?",false
13,Client,"Okay, that would be helpful.",false
13,Therapist,"Before vaccines were developed, many children who contracted these diseases faced serious risks, including death, disability, and long-term health issues like brain damage, deafness, and blindness from measles, or paralysis from polio. It's essential to consider these potential outcomes when weighing the decision.",false
13,Client,"I had no idea it was that serious. I've never even heard of some of these diseases, like polio.",false
13,Therapist,"That's not surprising, given how effective vaccines have been in reducing the incidence of these diseases. As a result, many people aren't familiar with them. Now that we've discussed this information, how are you feeling about vaccinating Lilly?",false
13,Client,I guess it's okay. My main priority is just wanting her to be healthy and safe.,false
13,Therapist,It's clear that you want to make the best decisions for Lilly's health and well-being. It's great that you're taking the time to research and consider your options carefully.,false
13,Client,"Yeah, I just want to do what's right for her.",false
22,Therapist,I'd like to explore your values clarification handout with you today. Can you share with me what you've discovered about your top values?,false
22,Client,"Yes, my number one value is family happiness, which is particularly important to me right now.",false
22,Therapist,"So, family happiness is your top priority at this time?",false
22,Client,"That's correct, it's number one for me, especially given our current situation.",false
22,Therapist,I understand. You mentioned that you regularly revisit your values clarification sheet every two to three months. Have you noticed any changes in your priorities over time?,false
22,Client,"Yes, my values have shifted each time I've completed the exercise.",false
22,Therapist,It sounds like your values are evolving. Is family happiness still the most important value for you right now because it's an area where you feel something is lacking?,false
22,Client,"Exactly, I recognize that family happiness is crucial to me, and I'm aware that it's not currently where I'd like it to be.",false
22,Therapist,Would you like to discuss this further and explore what's been going on with your family?,false
22,Client,"Yes, I can explain that my family hasn't been seeing eye-to-eye, and I feel that if we could find a middle ground, it would make a big difference.",false
22,Therapist,"It sounds like you're seeking a sense of unity and understanding within your family. Do you think that by being more present and listening to each other, you might be able to improve your family's happiness?",false
22,Client,"Yes, I believe that by doing my part and expressing my feelings, we can work towards greater family happiness.",false
22,Therapist,It's possible that your family members may not be aware of how important this is to you. Is that something you'd like to communicate to them?,false
22,Client,"Yes, I want them to understand how much family happiness means to me, especially now.",false
22,Therapist,You also mentioned that religion is another significant value for you. Can you tell me more about why it's important to you and how it relates to your current situation?,false
22,Client,"Initially, religion was my top value, but a challenging situation in my family made me question my faith.",false
22,Therapist,It can be difficult to maintain your faith when faced with tough circumstances. Do you feel like you're struggling with your religious beliefs right now?,false
22,Client,"Yes, I've lost some of my faith, but I'm not afraid to admit it.",false
22,Therapist,It takes courage to acknowledge and share your doubts. Do you think that talking about your faith and your questions might help you process your emotions and find a way forward?,false
22,Client,"Yes, I know that it's normal to have doubts, and I appreciate being able to discuss this openly.",false
22,Therapist,"You've done several values clarification exercises, and each time, your priorities have shifted. Can you reflect on what you've learned from this process?",false
22,Client,"At first, I was surprised by the changes, but now I understand that my values can evolve over time as I grow and face new experiences.",false
22,Therapist,It's great that you're open to change and willing to re-evaluate your priorities. Do you feel like there are areas in your life where you'd like to align more closely with your values?,false
22,Client,"Yes, I've realized that I haven't been focusing on some of my other important values, such as health, inner harmony, and security.",false
22,Therapist,Those are all significant aspects of your well-being. Do you think that your current focus on family happiness and religion might be taking time away from these other areas?,false
22,Client,"Yes, I've been so focused on my family and faith that I haven't had much time for myself or these other important values.",false
22,Therapist,It can be challenging to balance multiple priorities. Do you feel like you're neglecting your own needs and inner harmony in the process of caring for others?,false
22,Client,"Yes, I think that's true. I've been putting others first and not leaving much time for self-care or personal reflection.",false
22,Therapist,Taking care of yourself is essential to maintaining your inner harmony. Would you like to explore ways to prioritize your own needs and make time for self-care?,false
22,Client,"Yes, I'd like to find a better balance and make more time for myself, starting with getting enough sleep and taking care of my physical health.",false
22,Therapist,It's great that you're recognizing the importance of self-care. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss or work on in terms of aligning your values and priorities?,false
22,Client,I think I've just been feeling overwhelmed and trying to adjust to a new reality after a significant event in my life.,false
22,Therapist,"It can be difficult to adapt to change, especially when it's unexpected. Do you feel like you're making progress in coming to terms with this new reality and finding a way forward?",false
22,Client,"Yes, I'm trying to be more open-minded and flexible, and I appreciate your support and guidance throughout this process.",false
22,Therapist,"You're welcome. I'm glad we could have this conversation and explore your values together. If you need any further support or guidance in the future, don't hesitate to reach out.",false
22,Client,Thank you for listening and helping me clarify my priorities.,false
19,Therapist,It sounds like you're feeling frustrated with this situation?,false
19,Client,"Yeah, I just can't keep shoplifting. I got caught again, and I'm suspended from school, so I feel like I'm going to mess up my whole life if I don't stop.",false
19,Therapist,I understand.,false
19,Client,"It's a problem. My friends and I think it's fun, but I know I need to change.",false
19,Therapist,"Okay, let's explore this further.",false
19,Client,"I want to make a change, but I'm not sure how.",false
19,Therapist,"So, it seems like you're ready to move away from this behavior, but the next steps aren't clear to you.",false
19,Client,"Yeah, that's right. I don't know what to do because my friends are involved, and they're not exactly positive influences.",false
19,Therapist,I see.,false
19,Client,"And to be honest, it has been fun, which makes it harder for me to want to stop.",false
19,Therapist,"It can be challenging when something feels enjoyable, even if it's not good for us.",false
19,Client,"Exactly. There isn't much else going on in my life that's as exciting as this, like stealing CDs with my friends. It was working out fine until I got caught.",false
19,Therapist,I'm listening and trying to understand your perspective.,false
25,Therapist,"Liz, what's been on your mind lately that you're considering changing or feeling uncertain about?",false
25,Client,I really want to start working out again and establish a routine to improve my health and wellbeing.,false
25,Therapist,What motivates you to make this change at this time?,false
25,Client,"I'm tired of feeling sluggish and uncomfortable, especially with winter approaching, and I want to have more energy.",false
25,Therapist,I understand.,false
25,Client,I'm also not happy with how my clothes fit and I don't feel comfortable in my own skin.,false
25,Therapist,You're experiencing some discomfort with your current situation.,false
25,Client,"Yes, that's right.",false
25,Therapist,Can you help me understand what benefits you hope to gain from making this change?,false
25,Client,"In the past, exercise has always made me feel good about myself and improved my overall mood, and I want to be a positive role model for my kids by showing them that physical activity is a normal part of life.",false
25,Therapist,"So, you're looking to improve your health for yourself and also set a good example for your children?",false
25,Client,Exactly.,false
25,Therapist,"If you were to start exercising more regularly, how do you think you would go about fitting it into your daily routine?",false
25,Client,"I would probably need to discuss it with my husband and find a time that works for both of us, maybe in the morning, evening, or on weekends, when he can watch the kids.",false
25,Therapist,It sounds like you're looking for a balance between taking care of yourself and not disrupting your family's routine.,false
25,Client,That's right.,false
25,Therapist,"On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being not important at all and 10 being very important, how would you rate the importance of starting to exercise more?",false
25,Client,"I would say around a 7 or 8, because I'm really motivated to change my current situation and improve my health.",false
25,Therapist,"What makes it more of a 7 or 8 for you, rather than a lower number?",false
25,Client,"Because being overweight and unhealthy is really affecting my self-esteem and overall wellbeing, and I'm eager to make a positive change.",false
25,Therapist,"So, just to summarize, you're feeling motivated to start exercising due to your current health and wellbeing, and you want to be a good role model for your kids, but you're struggling with finding the right time to fit it into your schedule without disrupting your family's routine.",false
25,Client,That's exactly right.,false
25,Therapist,"Now that we've explored this further, what do you think your next steps will be?",false
25,Client,"I'll probably start by finding days to go for walks or runs while the weather is still nice, and look into local gyms with daycare options so I can easily fit in a workout.",false
25,Therapist,It sounds like you have some concrete ideas for how to move forward with this goal.,false
25,Client,"Yes, I do.",false
28,Therapist,"Hello Carrie, I appreciate you taking the time to meet with me today.",false
28,Client,"Thank you, my doctor recommended that I speak with someone about my struggles.",false
28,Therapist,What motivated you to seek help at this time?,false
28,Client,I've been dealing with a long-standing issue of trying to quit smoking.,false
28,Therapist,"So, quitting smoking is a significant goal for you right now?",false
28,Client,"Yes, I've wanted to quit for a very long time.",false
28,Therapist,Can you help me understand what's driving your desire to quit smoking at this point in your life?,false
28,Client,"Well, my 15-year-old daughter is strongly against my smoking, and I'm also concerned about my health - I have asthma, chronic bronchitis, and I'm having trouble breathing when I exercise.",false
28,Therapist,It sounds like being a smoker can be quite isolating and stigmatized in today's society.,false
28,Client,"Yes, it feels like being an outcast, even among non-smokers.",false
28,Therapist,"As a mother, you want to be a positive role model for your daughter, especially at her age when she may be more likely to consider smoking herself.",false
28,Client,"Exactly, I want to set a good example for her.",false
28,Therapist,"You mentioned some significant health concerns, including asthma and chronic bronchitis - can you tell me more about those issues?",false
28,Client,"Yes, and I also have emphysema in its early stages.",false
28,Therapist,I'm so sorry to hear that - the onset of emphysema can be a frightening experience.,false
28,Client,Thank you for understanding.,false
28,Therapist,Can you recall when you were first diagnosed with these health issues?,false
28,Client,"It's been about 10 years ago, when my daughter was around five years old and I had a severe breathing episode.",false
28,Therapist,That must have been terrifying for both you and your daughter.,false
28,Client,"Yes, she was so scared that she called 911 and they took me to the hospital.",false
28,Therapist,Your daughter's quick thinking likely saved you from a more serious situation.,false
28,Client,"Yes, she's very intelligent and resourceful.",false
28,Therapist,You've tried quitting smoking before using Chantix - can you tell me about your experience with that?,false
28,Client,"Unfortunately, I had severe side effects, including nightmares, nausea, and agitation, which made it impossible for me to continue.",false
28,Therapist,Those side effects can be debilitating - it's understandable that you wouldn't want to continue with the medication.,false
28,Client,"Exactly, and it didn't even help me quit smoking in the end.",false
28,Therapist,How long has it been since you last tried using Chantix?,false
28,Client,It's been about two to three years ago.,false
28,Therapist,You've had some time to reflect on that experience - what do you think might work better for you this time around?,false
28,Client,"I'm not sure, but I know I need to find a different approach.",false
28,Therapist,"Have you ever been able to quit smoking completely, even if it was just for a short period?",false
28,Client,"Only when I was in the hospital and couldn't smoke - but even then, I snuck out to have a cigarette.",false
28,Therapist,What was the longest period you went without smoking during that time?,false
28,Client,"About three days, but it wasn't by choice - I was forced to quit due to my circumstances.",false
28,Therapist,What did you notice about yourself during those three days without smoking?,false
28,Client,I had constant cravings and thoughts about smoking - it was like my body was craving something it was used to having.,false
28,Therapist,It sounds like the nicotine addiction is a significant challenge for you.,false
28,Client,"Yes, and it's not just physical - there's also a psychological aspect to it, like when I wake up in the morning and want a coffee with a cigarette.",false
28,Therapist,It's like your brain has paired those two activities together - coffee and smoking.,false
28,Client,"Exactly, and it's hard for me to imagine having one without the other.",false
28,Therapist,"Cigarettes can be very versatile in terms of how they make you feel - they can be calming or stimulating, depending on the situation.",false
28,Client,"Yes, that's true - but ultimately, they're harming my health.",false
28,Therapist,Your aunt once told you that smoking is like putting another nail in your coffin - how did that make you feel?,false
28,Client,"At first, I was defensive and tried to justify my smoking, but deep down, I know she's right.",false
28,Therapist,"It's interesting that you mention feeling ostracized for smoking now, when it used to be seen as glamorous.",false
28,Client,"Yes, it's like society's attitude towards smoking has completely flipped - now it's stigmatized and frowned upon.",false
28,Therapist,"That can be a difficult adjustment to make, especially if you've been smoking for a long time.",false
28,Client,Exactly - it feels like I'm being judged and criticized all the time.,false
40,Therapist,"It's great to hear that you're doing well, can you tell me more about what's been going on for you over these past three months?",false
40,Client,"Pretty good, it's been three months now since I last used meth.",false
40,Therapist,"That's a significant milestone, isn't it? You've made it three months without using.",false
40,Client,"Um, and—",false
40,Therapist,"You were saying something, please go on.",false
40,Client,"Right, so it's been three months, and things have been going pretty well for me.",false
40,Therapist,"I'm glad to hear that you're doing well, what's contributed to this positive experience?",false
40,Client,"Right, it's been three months, and I've been doing pretty well, and I also met a couple of new friends.",false
40,Therapist,"That sounds like a great development, meeting new people can be really helpful.",false
40,Client,"Um, and I met a couple new friends.",false
40,Therapist,"So, how have things been since you distanced yourself from your ex-boyfriend, who was also your dealer?",false
40,Client,Right.,false
40,Therapist,"And how do you find that's working out for you, setting those boundaries?",false
40,Client,"It's been good, I haven't answered his calls, and I've also been avoiding a couple of other friends who might not be the best influence.",false
40,Therapist,"Okay, I see.",false
40,Client,"-and a couple of my other friends have tried to call me as well, and I haven't answered the phone, so it's been good for me to just reach out and meet new people in my neighborhood.",false
40,Therapist,"It sounds like you've made some really positive changes in your life, including your environment and the people you're spending time with.",false
40,Client,"Yeah, the new friends, and I've also been using the breathing exercises you taught me when I start to feel stressed, which helps a lot.",false
40,Therapist,So it seems like these new coping strategies are really helping you manage stress and difficult emotions.,false
40,Client,"Yeah, the new friends, and I've been using the breathing exercises you taught me, when I get-- start to feel a little stressed out, and I've been- I've been using those and it helps me, I go for a walk and do my breathing exercises, and it calms me down.",false
34,Therapist,"I appreciate you taking the time to meet with me today, Nina. I'm looking forward to getting to know you better and understanding what brings you here.",false
34,Client,My doctor referred me because he's concerned that I haven't been making the best choices during my pregnancy.,false
34,Therapist,"It sounds like your doctor is worried about your behavior, and you're feeling a bit uncertain about it as well.",false
34,Client,"Yeah, he mentioned that I've been drinking too much, and even though I don't think it's been excessive, he's still concerned about the potential impact on my baby.",false
34,Therapist,"You're feeling anxious about the possibility of harming your baby, and you want to make sure you're doing everything you can to give them a healthy start.",false
34,Client,"Exactly, I don't want to do anything that could hurt my child, but at the same time, I'm scared that I may have already made some mistakes.",false
34,Therapist,It's understandable that you're feeling conflicted. You care deeply about your baby and want to provide the best possible life for them.,false
34,Client,"Yeah, I just feel like I've been stuck between two different worlds - my old life and this new reality of being a mother.",false
34,Therapist,"It can be challenging to navigate these two identities. On one hand, you have your existing friendships and social life, and on the other hand, you're preparing for this significant new responsibility.",false
34,Client,"Exactly, it's hard to know how to balance those two worlds, especially when my friends are still partying and having fun.",false
34,Therapist,"You're feeling pressure from your social circle to maintain your current lifestyle, but at the same time, you're aware that your priorities need to shift as you prepare for motherhood.",false
34,Client,"Yeah, I feel like I'm being pulled in two different directions, and it's hard to know which path to choose.",false
34,Therapist,It sounds like you're struggling with the idea of letting go of your old life and embracing this new chapter. You're worried about losing your sense of identity and connection with your friends.,false
34,Client,"Yeah, I don't want to lose myself in the process of becoming a mother, but at the same time, I know that I need to make some changes.",false
34,Therapist,You're recognizing that you have a unique opportunity for growth and transformation with this pregnancy. It's a chance to re-evaluate your priorities and make positive changes in your life.,false
34,Client,"Yeah, I guess I just feel like I've been given a second chance, and I don't want to waste it.",false
34,Therapist,"You're feeling a sense of hope and renewal, but also some uncertainty about how to move forward. You're wondering if you have the strength and resilience to make the necessary changes.",false
34,Client,"Yeah, I just feel like I've made so many mistakes already, and I'm not sure if I can overcome them.",false
34,Therapist,"It's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed. However, it's essential to recognize that every day is a new opportunity for growth and positive change.",false
34,Client,"Yeah, I guess you're right. I just need to take things one step at a time and focus on making healthy choices from now on.",false
34,Therapist,"That's a great attitude to have. It's all about progress, not perfection. You're taking the first steps towards creating a better life for yourself and your baby.",false
34,Client,"Yeah, I feel like I have a lot to learn and a long way to go, but I'm willing to try.",false
34,Therapist,"That's all anyone can ask for - a willingness to learn and grow. I'm here to support you on this journey, and I'm confident that you'll make the best decisions for yourself and your baby.",false
34,Client,"Thanks, just talking about this has helped me feel more clarity and purpose.",false
49,Therapist,"Welcome back, Catherine. I'm interested in hearing about your thoughts and reflections over the past week. What's been on your mind since our last session?",false
49,Client,Mm.,false
49,Therapist,Can you tell me more about what's changed for you this time around? What are your thoughts about being here now?,false
49,Client,I suppose my expectations are a bit clearer about why I'm here.,false
49,Therapist,That's a good starting point. It sounds like you've had some time to reflect on your situation.,false
49,Client,"I guess I've been thinking about how much money I've been losing lately, and that's made me more motivated to be here.",false
49,Therapist,I sense a shift in your perspective since our last session. Can you tell me more about what's driving this change?,false
49,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
49,Therapist,"It seems like we can work well together to address these issues. From my perspective, it appears that you have the energy and motivation to make positive changes.",false
49,Client,Mm.,false
49,Therapist,Let's explore some of the key areas we'd like to focus on over the next nine months. What are your thoughts on where we should start?,false
49,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
49,Therapist,"We touched on the issue of gambling last time, and how it's affected your relationships with family and friends. Can you tell me more about your thoughts on this topic?",false
49,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
49,Therapist,"I recall that you mentioned feeling like you deserved to gamble, and there were some underlying thoughts around that. Are you open to exploring those thoughts further?",false
49,Client,"Yeah, I'm happy to explore it.",false
49,Therapist,"When we start to examine these issues more closely, it's not uncommon to feel uncomfortable. How do you typically manage feelings of discomfort or uncertainty?",false
49,Client,"Hmm, I don't know, I probably lock off a bit.",false
49,Therapist,"That can be a common response. If you were to feel overwhelmed or uncomfortable during our session, how would I know? What signs might I look out for?",false
49,Client,"Yeah, um, I'm sure you've already noticed. Probably fidgeting.",false
49,Therapist,It would be really helpful if you could let me know when you're feeling uncomfortable or struggling with the conversation.,false
49,Client,When I'm feeling uncomfortable?,false
49,Therapist,"Yes, exactly. If you could just say, ""I'm starting to feel overwhelmed,"" that would help me adjust our conversation.",false
49,Client,Okay.,false
49,Therapist,Let's discuss your goals and aspirations. What are some things you'd like to achieve in the next five years?,false
49,Client,Maybe I wanna have traveled and found the man of my dreams.,false
49,Therapist,"Those sound like important goals to you. On a scale of 1 to 100, how important is it for you to address your current financial situation and work towards those goals?",false
49,Client,About 80.,false
49,Therapist,That's a significant priority for you. How confident do you feel about making progress on these issues?,false
49,Client,I'm gonna say I'm completely confident.,false
49,Therapist,Can you rate your confidence level on a scale of 1 to 100?,false
49,Client,"What, on my confidence to stop?",false
49,Therapist,"Not necessarily to stop, but to make positive changes and work towards your goals.",false
49,Client,"It's hard when it's part of your lifestyle, you know?",false
49,Therapist,I understand. You mentioned going to the pub with friends last night and gambling. Can you tell me more about what happened?,false
49,Client,Yeah.,false
49,Therapist,"Did you stop gambling when your friends stopped, or did you continue on your own?",false
49,Client,"Oh, I had to stop halfway 'cause I'd ran out of money.",false
49,Therapist,It sounds like you're still struggling with the behavior. How do you think you can make progress on this issue?,false
49,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
49,Therapist,"Let's explore some strategies for managing high-risk situations, like being at the pub. What are some ways you could avoid or cope with those situations?",false
49,Client,"Um, I haven't managed it to this point, so I don't know.",false
49,Therapist,"You've already identified a few potential strategies, such as cutting up your credit cards and avoiding certain social situations.",false
49,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
49,Therapist,Those are great starting points. What do you think is the hardest part of making these changes?,false
49,Client,I believe then to cut off some of my friendships.,false
49,Therapist,That can be a challenging but important step. How far away do you think you are from making those changes?,false
49,Client,Seems like a bit of an unrealistic dream.,false
49,Therapist,What's one thing you can do between now and our next session to move closer to your goals?,false
49,Client,Find the scissors.,false
49,Therapist,"Cutting up your credit cards is a great first step. We can also explore other resources, such as budgeting advice, to help you manage your finances.",false
49,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
49,Therapist,Let's discuss how we can set up a meeting with a budget advisor to support you in getting back on track financially.,false
49,Client,"Mm-hmm, that will be good.",false
46,Therapist,"Jacob, I've reviewed your physical exam results, and everything appears normal. Are there any questions or concerns you'd like to discuss with me?",false
46,Client,"No, nothing comes to mind.",false
46,Therapist,"Okay, that's fine. I noticed you completed our alcohol and drug questionnaire. Would you be comfortable reviewing it with me?",false
46,Client,"Sure, that's okay.",false
46,Therapist,"Before we begin, I want to assure you that our conversation is confidential. I'll only share information with your parents if you give me permission or if I have concerns about your safety or the safety of others. Does that make sense to you?",false
46,Client,"Yeah, that sounds right.",false
46,Therapist,"Let's take a look at your questionnaire. I see you've indicated that you occasionally use alcohol to relax, feel better about yourself, or fit in with friends. Can you tell me more about your experiences with alcohol?",false
46,Client,"It's not a big deal, really. Sometimes my friends and I will have a few beers when we're hanging out or at a party, or maybe some rum and cokes.",false
46,Therapist,How many drinks do you typically have on those occasions?,false
46,Client,"Probably three or four, but I don't usually keep track.",false
46,Therapist,And how often would you say you drink with your friends?,false
46,Client,Maybe once or twice a month.,false
46,Therapist,"So, to summarize, you drink with friends about one or two times a month, having around three or four beers or mixed drinks each time. How long have you been drinking in this way?",false
46,Client,Probably since last October.,false
46,Therapist,"That's about six months. I'm curious, what do you enjoy about drinking alcohol?",false
46,Client,"I'm not sure... it's just fun to drink with my friends at parties, and I like the taste.",false
46,Therapist,"It sounds like you feel more relaxed and have a good time when you're drinking with friends, and you also enjoy the taste. Is that right?",false
46,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
46,Therapist,I'm also interested in exploring any aspects of your alcohol use that you might not enjoy. Are there any downsides to drinking for you?,false
46,Client,"Well, I don't like getting sick in the mornings from hangovers, and I hate it when I start throwing up.",false
46,Therapist,Have you ever experienced a blackout or memory loss after drinking?,false
46,Client,"No, but it happened to someone I know.",false
46,Therapist,"Have you had any problems related to your drinking, such as issues at home, school, or elsewhere?",false
46,Client,"One time I missed my first period class because I had a hangover and overslept. My mom got mad at me because I wouldn't get out of bed, and she knew I had been drinking.",false
46,Therapist,"It sounds like you've had some negative consequences from drinking, including getting into trouble with your mom and missing school. Is that right?",false
46,Client,"Yeah, but it only happened once.",false
46,Therapist,I see that you've indicated on the questionnaire that you haven't ridden in a car with someone who's been drinking or driven after drinking yourself. Is that correct?,false
46,Client,"Yeah, that's right.",false
46,Therapist,"That's great to hear. As your doctor, I want to express my concern about your drinking. When teens drink, there are risks involved, such as injuring oneself. Even moderate drinking can affect the developing brain. That's why I recommend that all my adolescent patients avoid drinking altogether.",false
46,Client,Okay.,false
46,Therapist,"If you were to rate your readiness to stop drinking on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being not ready at all and ten being very ready, what number would you choose?",false
46,Client,"Um, probably a five.",false
46,Therapist,"A five. Can you help me understand why you didn't choose a lower number, like two or three, indicating that you're only slightly ready to stop drinking?",false
46,Client,I guess I'm just tired of getting into trouble.,false
46,Therapist,What do you think you could do to avoid getting into trouble in the future?,false
46,Client,"Um, not drink, I suppose.",false
46,Therapist,Have you ever tried stopping or reducing your drinking before?,false
46,Client,"No, not really.",false
46,Therapist,Some people your age find it helpful to try abstaining from drinking for a period of time to see how it feels. What do you think about trying that?,false
46,Client,I could probably do that.,false
46,Therapist,How long do you think you could go without drinking?,false
46,Client,I'm not sure.,false
46,Therapist,Do you think you could manage two months without drinking?,false
46,Client,"Yeah, probably.",false
46,Therapist,What strategies do you think would make it easier for you to avoid drinking?,false
46,Client,"Um, I could drink something else when my friends are drinking, like just coke.",false
46,Therapist,Are there any other things that might help you stay on track?,false
46,Client,"I could hang out with friends who don't drink or invite them to parties and have fun without drinking, since not everyone drinks at parties.",false
46,Therapist,Is there someone in your life who could offer support and encouragement as you try to reduce or stop your drinking?,false
46,Client,"Yeah, my friends who don't drink would probably be happy if I stopped drinking, and they'd support me.",false
46,Therapist,"It sounds like you've identified some reasons to stop drinking, such as avoiding hangovers and trouble, and you've come up with some strategies to help you succeed. I'm proud of you for taking this step. How about we schedule a follow-up appointment in two months to check in on your progress?",false
46,Client,Okay.,false
43,Therapist,"Tanya, I appreciate you taking the time to meet with me today and share your concerns. Can you help me understand what's been on your mind lately that you've been feeling uncertain about changing?",false
43,Client,"I've been struggling with a lot of anxiety, and there's this significant test I need to take that I've been putting off due to my anxiety. I don't feel confident in my ability to do well, and it's been weighing on my mind for years.",false
43,Therapist,"It sounds like your anxiety is creating a barrier for you, making it difficult to feel confident about taking the exam.",false
43,Client,"Yes, that's right.",false
43,Therapist,"And as a result, it's easier for you to avoid taking the test altogether.",false
43,Client,"Exactly, I tend to avoid it and put it off.",false
43,Therapist,"On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being not confident at all and 10 being very confident, how would you rate your confidence in managing your anxiety when it comes to taking this exam?",false
43,Client,I'd say around a 4 or 5.,false
43,Therapist,"So, you're rating yourself a 4 or 5, which suggests you have some degree of confidence, but still struggle with significant doubts.",false
43,Client,"Yes, because despite having anxiety, I've taken the first step by scheduling the exam, which is progress for me.",false
43,Therapist,"You mentioned that you've actually made an appointment to take the exam, which is a significant step. Can you tell me more about what motivated you to take this step?",false
43,Client,"Yes, I have scheduled it before, but this time feels different because I've already rescheduled it once and now it's approaching.",false
43,Therapist,"It sounds like you've been in this situation before, where your anxiety led you to reschedule the exam. What makes you think this time might be different?",false
43,Client,"I think it's just a matter of time; I need to do it, and then I can move forward, whether I pass or not.",false
43,Therapist,It's encouraging that you're thinking about how good you'll feel once you've taken the exam and can put this behind you.,false
43,Client,"Yes, but at the same time, I worry about what might happen if I don't pass, and the potential embarrassment of sharing my results with others.",false
43,Therapist,You're concerned about avoiding those negative feelings that come with anxiety. Can you think of a time in the past when you overcame your anxiety and achieved something you were proud of?,false
43,Client,"One experience that comes to mind is when I had to do a recording for work, and despite my initial anxiety, it turned out well, and my supervisor and consultant were impressed.",false
43,Therapist,"That experience must have been really empowering for you, building your self-confidence and changing how you saw yourself.",false
43,Client,"Yes, it was a great feeling, knowing that I could do something well despite my doubts.",false
43,Therapist,It takes a lot of courage to face your fears and succeed. How do you think you can apply that experience to your current situation with the exam?,false
43,Client,"I think if I can pass this test, I might be able to recapture that feeling of confidence and pride in myself.",false
43,Therapist,"So, creating opportunities for yourself to feel that sense of accomplishment is important to you.",false
43,Client,"Yes, it is.",false
43,Therapist,"You also mentioned feeling proud of yourself, which is a great motivator. To wrap up our conversation, what do you think would need to happen for your confidence to increase from a 4 or 5 to a 7?",false
43,Client,"I think if I can just focus on preparing and see how I do, my confidence might grow, and having faith in myself would make a big difference.",false
43,Therapist,"So, practicing positive self-talk and having faith in your abilities could really help you build confidence.",false
43,Client,"Yes, that's right.",false
43,Therapist,"To summarize, it sounds like you're still feeling anxious about the upcoming exam, but this time you seem more determined to take it. You've had experiences in the past where you overcame anxiety and felt proud of yourself, and you're ready to remind yourself that you can be successful.",false
43,Client,"Yes, that's right.",false
43,Therapist,"Thank you, Tanya, for sharing your thoughts with me today.",false
43,Client,Thank you.,false
61,Therapist,"Hello, Mrs. Smith. I'm Terri, one of the nurses who works with Dr. Fields. It's nice to see you again.",false
61,Client,"Yes, I remember you from our previous meeting.",false
61,Therapist,I recall that Dr. Fields discussed the possibility of trying a tai chi class with you during your last visit. I'd like to follow up on how that experience was for you.,false
61,Client,I did attend one session.,false
61,Therapist,Can you tell me more about what that was like for you?,false
61,Client,"The instructor was very nice, and it was beautiful to watch, but I felt self-conscious because I had to use my walker and sit in a chair.",false
61,Therapist,"It sounds like you enjoyed the atmosphere, but felt a bit uncomfortable due to your physical limitations. Is that correct?",false
61,Client,"Yes, I felt very self-conscious about not being able to participate fully.",false
61,Therapist,What were your hopes for attending the tai chi class?,false
61,Client,"Dr. Fields mentioned it could help with my balance, and I'm still experiencing some difficulties with that.",false
61,Therapist,"So, you were hoping to improve your balance through tai chi. Did you feel like you saw any benefits from the one session you attended?",false
61,Client,Not yet.,false
61,Therapist,What is your primary goal right now?,false
61,Client,I want to go home.,false
61,Therapist,What's most important to you about returning home?,false
61,Client,"Everything - being with my dog, tending to my garden, and regaining my independence.",false
61,Therapist,It sounds like you're looking forward to resuming your normal routine and activities. What do you think you need to work on to achieve that goal?,false
61,Client,The staff told me I need to be able to walk down the hallway securely with my walker without feeling unsteady.,false
61,Therapist,Do you agree that's a necessary step for you to take before going home?,false
61,Client,"Yes, I don't want to risk falling.",false
61,Therapist,How would you describe your progress in physical therapy so far?,false
61,Client,"It's getting better, but it still hurts. The pain is not as intense as it was before.",false
61,Therapist,It sounds like you're making some progress. You mentioned earlier that you were interested in trying tai chi again. Is that something you'd still like to pursue?,false
61,Client,"Yes, I would like to give it another try.",false
61,Therapist,What needs to happen for you to feel comfortable attending the tai chi class again?,false
61,Client,"I need to make arrangements for transportation, and I have to overcome my self-consciousness about using a walker.",false
61,Therapist,"On a scale of 1 to 10, how confident do you feel about making those arrangements?",false
61,Client,"About a 5 - I know I can do it, but it's challenging for me to do on my own.",false
61,Therapist,What makes it a 5 instead of a lower number?,false
61,Client,The fact that I'm doing it by myself. It would be helpful if someone could assist me.,false
61,Therapist,Would having support make a difference for you in feeling more confident about attending the tai chi class?,false
61,Client,"Yes, it would.",false
61,Therapist,"Is there anyone who can help you with making those arrangements, such as your daughter?",false
61,Client,"She could, but I'd have to wait at least a week for her to visit.",false
61,Therapist,Would you like us to help facilitate the arrangements for you?,false
61,Client,"That would be helpful. Yes, please.",false
61,Therapist,We can work with the rehab center to make those arrangements. They have a van that can transport patients.,false
61,Client,That sounds good.,false
61,Therapist,"As for feeling more self-confident, is there anything else that might help you overcome your concerns?",false
61,Client,I think I just need to do it myself and get used to the idea of attending the class with my walker.,false
61,Therapist,Are there any other obstacles that might prevent you from attending the tai chi class?,false
61,Client,"No, I don't think so. Just the arrangements.",false
61,Therapist,"It seems like we have a plan in place. We'll help with the arrangements, and you can try the tai chi class again.",false
61,Client,That sounds good.,false
61,Therapist,"Before you leave today, I'll call the rehab center to make those arrangements. Then, when you come back for your follow-up appointment with Dr. Fields, we can check in on how the second tai chi class went.",false
61,Client,"Okay, thank you.",false
61,Therapist,"You're welcome, Mrs. Smith. It was nice speaking with you today, and I look forward to hearing about your progress.",false
61,Client,Okay.,false
64,Therapist,"Welcome, Ricky. It's nice to meet you.",false
64,Client,Thank you. Nice to meet you too.,false
64,Therapist,I understand you found our location without any issues?,false
64,Client,"Yes, it was straightforward.",false
64,Therapist,Great. Have you been to a therapy session like this before?,false
64,Client,"No, this is my first time.",false
64,Therapist,"Okay. Well, I've been briefed on why you're here today, but I'd love to hear it in your own words. Can you tell me what brings you here?",false
64,Client,"Sure. About two or three weeks ago, some friends came over and expressed concern about my drug use. At first, I was defensive, but then I thought maybe it wouldn't hurt to talk to someone about it.",false
64,Therapist,That takes a lot of courage. Can you tell me more about what led you to decide to come here?,false
64,Client,"Yeah. I did some research online and read about this place, so I thought I'd give it a try.",false
64,Therapist,It sounds like your friends' concerns resonated with you on some level. Can you help me understand what was going through your mind when they approached you?,false
64,Client,"I guess I hadn't really thought about my drug use until they mentioned it. But then I started thinking, maybe there is something to look at.",false
64,Therapist,"You're not sure if their concerns are valid, but you're open to exploring the issue.",false
64,Client,"Exactly. I mean, they care about me, so I want to consider what they're saying.",false
64,Therapist,That makes sense. Can you tell me more about your drug use? What specifically are we talking about?,false
64,Client,"Um, I do a bit of P now and then, and sometimes I smoke or take party pills on the weekends.",false
64,Therapist,"Okay. When you say ""now and then,"" can you give me a better idea of how often that is?",false
64,Client,Maybe a couple of times a week?,false
64,Therapist,Is this methamphetamine we're talking about? A couple of times a week?,false
64,Client,"Yeah, that's right.",false
64,Therapist,You mentioned earlier that your friends are concerned. Did they express specific worries about your well-being or behavior?,false
64,Client,"Yeah, they were worried about me, and I could understand where they were coming from.",false
64,Therapist,It sounds like their intervention was a bit of a shock for you.,false
64,Client,"Yeah, it was. I didn't expect them to be so concerned.",false
64,Therapist,Can you help me understand what you like about using meth? What are some of the positive experiences you've had with it?,false
64,Client,"Well, it's often linked to socializing and having fun with friends. It feels good, and I enjoy the feeling of being happy and excited.",false
64,Therapist,It sounds like using meth is closely tied to your social life and sense of belonging.,false
64,Client,"Yeah, that's true. When I'm in that scene, it feels like everyone is doing it, so it's just part of the experience.",false
64,Therapist,You're not sure if you can separate your social life from your drug use.,false
64,Client,Exactly. It's all kind of intertwined.,false
64,Therapist,Let's explore that further. What do you think would happen if you weren't using meth as much?,false
64,Client,I'm not sure. Maybe I'd feel left out or like I'm missing out on fun experiences.,false
64,Therapist,That's a valid concern. But what about the potential benefits of reducing your meth use? Have you thought about how that might impact your life?,false
64,Client,"Yeah, maybe it would help me with my acting career and financial stability.",false
64,Therapist,Those are important goals for you. Can you tell me more about how you think meth use might be affecting your career aspirations?,false
64,Client,"Well, I've had some auditions where I didn't do as well as I could have, and I wonder if the meth use played a role in that.",false
64,Therapist,That's a good point. It's possible that the meth use is compromising your ability to perform at your best.,false
64,Client,"Yeah, it's definitely possible.",false
64,Therapist,What about your financial situation? How do you think meth use is impacting your finances?,false
64,Client,"It's definitely a factor. I've been spending more money on meth than I can afford, and it's affecting my ability to pay rent and bills.",false
64,Therapist,That sounds really tough. Have you thought about seeking help or support to address these issues?,false
64,Client,"Yeah, that's why I'm here. I want to explore my options and see if there are ways to improve my situation.",false
64,Therapist,"Okay. Well, let's summarize what we've discussed so far. You're concerned about your meth use and how it might be affecting your life, but you're not sure if you're ready to make any changes.",false
64,Client,That's right.,false
64,Therapist,You're open to exploring the issue further and considering different options for addressing your concerns.,false
64,Client,"Yeah, that sounds about right.",false
64,Therapist,Okay. What do you think would be a good first step for you in terms of addressing your meth use?,false
64,Client,I'm not sure. Maybe just being more mindful of how often I'm using and trying to cut back a bit?,false
64,Therapist,That's a great start. Being more aware of your usage can help you make more informed decisions about your behavior.,false
64,Client,"Yeah, that makes sense.",false
64,Therapist,"Let's also explore some other options for you, such as finding alternative social activities or support groups that don't involve meth use.",false
64,Client,"Okay, that sounds like a good idea.",false
73,Therapist,"So, he introduced you to it, and with his encouragement, you decided to try it.",false
73,Client,"He, um, introduced me to it too, so I've tried oxy.",false
73,Therapist,You've tried oxy; can you tell me more about that experience?,false
73,Client,Yeah.,false
73,Therapist,It sounds like he presented it as a way to manage pain; is that right?,false
73,Client,"Well, yeah, he said it was a pain medicine.",false
73,Therapist,He suggested it would help with some of the pain you've been experiencing.,false
73,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
73,Therapist,"You found it helpful in certain ways, particularly with managing your pain.",false
73,Client,"And it has, but I don't do it as often, it's just sometimes.",false
73,Therapist,"So, you trusted his advice and found it helpful, but you're also aware that it's not a permanent solution for everything you're going through.",false
73,Client,Dealing with my grandma's loss.,false
73,Therapist,It seems like it's been helping you cope with your grief.,false
73,Client,"Yeah, I feel alone, and I just, I miss her and, it does- it does help but,",false
73,Therapist,"You've found some relief from your emotional pain, but you're also hesitant about relying on it.",false
73,Client,-I don't wanna have to rely on having to take that.,false
73,Therapist,"You're aware that while it provides temporary comfort, you don't want it to become a long-term dependence.",false
73,Client,"Mm-hmm. Yeah, and—",false
73,Therapist,You're recognizing the potential risks of relying on it and wanting to explore other ways to manage your emotions.,false
73,Client,Right.,false
73,Therapist,It sounds like you're navigating a lot of challenging emotions right now; is that a fair statement?,false
73,Client,"Yeah, it is.",false
73,Therapist,"You've been doing the best you can to cope, but you also have some concerns about your choices.",false
73,Client,"Yeah, well, I don't really know too much about it, other than it makes me feel good.",false
73,Therapist,"For now, you're aware that it provides a sense of relief, even if you're not fully informed about its effects.",false
73,Client,Yeah.,false
67,Therapist,May I review the form you completed prior to our session? This is a standard part of our intake process for all clients.,false
67,Client,"Yes, that's fine.",false
67,Therapist,"According to your responses, it appears you've consumed alcohol on a few occasions over the past year and used marijuana more frequently, approximately 30 days out of the last year. Can you tell me a bit more about this?",false
67,Client,That sounds about right.,false
67,Therapist,"When discussing substance use with clients, I want to emphasize that my role is not to dictate what you should or shouldn't do. Instead, I'm here to explore whether there are any changes you might be interested in making regarding your substance use. Could you share some thoughts about your marijuana use?",false
67,Client,"I vape using a pen, but I don't smoke it.",false
67,Therapist,How often would you say you vape marijuana?,false
67,Client,"A few times a month, I'd say.",false
67,Therapist,Do you ever vape anything else besides marijuana?,false
67,Client,"Once, someone shared a peppermint oil with me, and I tried that.",false
67,Therapist,May I share some information with you about the effects of marijuana use?,false
67,Client,"Yes, that's okay.",false
67,Therapist,"Research indicates that marijuana can have significant effects on the developing brain, including potential difficulties with concentration and memory. Additionally, vaping poses serious risks to lung health. It's also worth noting that about one in six individuals who start using marijuana as teenagers may develop an addiction later on. What are your thoughts on this information?",false
67,Client,I don't think it will affect me negatively.,false
67,Therapist,How do you perceive marijuana affecting you personally?,false
67,Client,It helps me relax and have fun with my friends.,false
67,Therapist,Are there any aspects of marijuana use that concern you or that you dislike?,false
67,Client,I worry about getting in trouble at school.,false
67,Therapist,What kind of trouble are you concerned about at school?,false
67,Client,I could get suspended and kicked off the basketball team.,false
67,Therapist,It sounds like staying in school and participating on the basketball team is very important to you. Is that correct?,false
67,Client,"Yes, it is.",false
67,Therapist,"Considering these priorities, are there any changes you'd like to make regarding your marijuana use?",false
67,Client,I was thinking about not using during basketball season.,false
67,Therapist,What benefits do you think you might experience if you didn't use marijuana during that time?,false
67,Client,I play better when I'm not under the influence.,false
67,Therapist,"So, it seems that marijuana use can impact your performance. What other benefits might you see from not using during basketball season?",false
67,Client,I'd avoid getting caught with my vape pen and wouldn't risk being kicked off the team.,false
67,Therapist,"It sounds like you have a clear goal to abstain from marijuana use once basketball season starts. How confident do you feel about achieving this goal, on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being not confident at all and 10 being very confident?",false
67,Client,I'd say around a 7.,false
67,Therapist,"You've chosen a 7. What makes you more confident in your ability to meet this goal rather than feeling less confident, say a 5?",false
67,Client,I'm pretty sure I can stop using for a month because I want to play well.,false
67,Therapist,What strategies do you think could help you achieve your goal of not using marijuana for a month?,false
67,Client,I'm not sure.,false
67,Therapist,Let's consider potential challenges. What situations might make you want to vape within the next month?,false
67,Client,"When I'm stressed or unhappy, that's usually when I feel like vaping.",false
67,Therapist,Are there alternative activities you could engage in instead of vaping when you're feeling that way?,false
67,Client,I enjoy playing video games.,false
67,Therapist,Anything else you might consider as an alternative?,false
67,Client,I could play basketball with my friend Sarah.,false
67,Therapist,"So, playing video games and basketball are ways you can manage your feelings without vaping. Is that right?",false
67,Client,"Yes, that's correct.",false
67,Therapist,"I'm glad to hear you've set a goal to quit using marijuana for a month and feel somewhat confident about achieving it. If you're willing, I'd like to schedule a follow-up appointment in about a month to check in on your progress.",false
67,Client,Okay.,false
67,Therapist,"Good luck with your basketball practice. Remember, my office is open Monday through Thursday if you need anything or just want to talk before our next scheduled appointment.",false
67,Client,Thank you.,false
70,Therapist,"Hello Dr. Martin, I'm Lori, the pharmacist on duty today. I understand you have some inquiries about citalopram. Could you spare a moment to discuss this further?",false
70,Client,"Yes, I can talk for a few minutes.",false
70,Therapist,What aspects of citalopram would you like to explore or clarify?,false
70,Client,"Honestly, I'm not very familiar with it, so I'd like to learn more.",false
70,Therapist,"Citalopram is an SSRI, primarily used to treat depression, and it's commonly prescribed in a 20-milligram dose, although it's available in 10, 20, and 40 milligrams. Typically, we monitor patients for symptom improvement over four to eight weeks.",false
70,Client,That's helpful to know. What about potential side effects I should be aware of?,false
70,Therapist,"Common side effects can include gastrointestinal issues, sedation, or sexual dysfunction. If a patient experiences these, we can consider adjusting the dose or exploring alternative medications. Do you have any further questions at this point?",false
70,Client,"Yes, are there any interactions I should know about, specifically with phenelzine?",false
70,Therapist,That's a great question. I'll need to verify that information for you. May I follow up with you later today to provide a more accurate answer?,false
70,Client,"That would be fine, thank you.",false
70,Therapist,You're welcome. I appreciate your time and look forward to speaking with you soon.,false
70,Client,Thank you as well.,false
79,Therapist,Can you help me understand what made you realize you'd messed up?,false
79,Client,"I was in a familiar situation, and I knew I'd gone too far. It felt like I was back in a pattern I thought I'd left behind, and I wanted to escape but couldn't. I felt like I'd ruined everything, and it was overwhelming.",false
79,Therapist,It sounds like you're saying that being in that situation again made you feel like you'd failed somehow. Can you tell me more about what was going through your mind when you talked to Erin the next day?,false
79,Client,"Yeah, I felt ashamed because I knew I could have kept going down that path, but something stopped me. I'm not sure if it was because I genuinely wanted to stop or if it was just convenient at the time.",false
79,Therapist,"So, it seems like you're wondering if you put something important to you at risk during that incident. Is that what's bothering you - the feeling that you might have jeopardized something valuable?",false
79,Client,"Yeah, that's it. I could have kept going and made things worse, but I didn't. At least, not that time.",false
79,Therapist,You're acknowledging that you did stop yourself from continuing down a harmful path. Can you explore with me what motivated you to stop - was it a sense of responsibility or something else?,false
79,Client,"Honestly, I'm not sure. Maybe it was just the convenience of the moment, or maybe I really did know I needed to stop.",false
79,Therapist,"You've made significant progress over the past three months, and that's something to be proud of. It sounds like getting to see your kids again was a major motivator for you - a reminder of what you're working towards.",false
79,Client,"Yeah, things have been better, and seeing my kids is a big part of that.",false
79,Therapist,"It seems like being able to see your kids was a turning point for you, a sign that you were on the right track. Can you tell me more about what that meant to you?",false
79,Client,"Yeah, it meant everything. It was a reminder of why I'm doing all this - to be there for them and to be a better person.",false
76,Therapist,"Hello Deborah, how are you feeling today?",false
76,Client,"I'm doing really well, thanks.",false
76,Therapist,You've completed your Values Clarification Sheet. Is there anything that stood out to you that you'd like to discuss?,false
76,Client,"Yes, I enjoyed the process and noticed that I ranked health as my top value because it encompasses physical, mental, spiritual, and emotional well-being for me.",false
76,Therapist,"So, health is your number one priority.",false
76,Client,"Yes, and it's influencing my decision to pursue a certification in fitness training. I've been working on this for five weeks and have a final exam coming up soon, which is making me a bit anxious, but I'm also looking forward to it.",false
76,Therapist,I understand.,false
76,Client,"This new career path is exciting for me because it combines my passion for physical activity and health, which is a nice change from my previous office work.",false
76,Therapist,It sounds like your priority on health is guiding you towards a more fulfilling career.,false
76,Client,"Yes, I've always enjoyed being active, and if I could, I'd love to coach tennis, but I don't think my skills are at that level yet.",false
76,Therapist,Have you reflected on your values using this sheet before?,false
76,Client,"Yes, I have done it previously.",false
76,Therapist,And has health always been your top priority?,false
76,Client,"It's usually been in the top three, but this time inner harmony is actually my second priority, which is interesting because it wasn't as high up in my previous reflections.",false
76,Therapist,Inner harmony is now your second priority.,false
76,Client,"Yes, and I think that's because I've been practicing yoga and teaching it, which has helped me find more peace and balance within myself.",false
76,Therapist,Would you like to explore how inner harmony affects your life further?,false
76,Client,"Yes, since practicing yoga, I feel more at peace with myself, especially during quiet moments or meditation.",false
76,Therapist,"So, yoga has been a key factor in cultivating inner harmony for you.",false
76,Client,"Yes, and it's also helped me realize that putting myself first isn't selfish; it's necessary for my own well-being and allows me to be more present for others.",false
76,Therapist,It sounds like you've had a shift in perspective regarding self-care and prioritizing your own needs.,false
76,Client,"Exactly, I used to think I had to put others first all the time, but now I understand that taking care of myself is essential and doesn't mean I'm being selfish.",false
76,Therapist,You're recognizing the importance of self-love and self-worth in maintaining inner harmony.,false
76,Client,"Yes, and it's freeing to know that helping others doesn't have to come at the expense of my own well-being.",false
76,Therapist,"Service to others is still important to you, but now it's balanced with your own needs.",false
76,Client,"Right, like when my family visits and I accommodate them, even if it's inconvenient, I remind myself that it's okay and that I can still prioritize my own needs.",false
76,Therapist,You're finding a balance between serving others and taking care of yourself.,false
76,Client,"Yes, and wisdom is also high on my list because I enjoy learning about different cultures and experiencing new things, which broadens my perspective and understanding of the world.",false
76,Therapist,"So, wisdom and personal growth are closely tied to your values of health and inner harmony.",false
76,Client,"Exactly, and pleasure is also important to me, but it's not just about seeking happiness all the time; it's about accepting that life has its ups and downs and finding joy in the journey.",false
76,Therapist,You're acknowledging that true joy comes from embracing both the positive and negative aspects of life.,false
76,Client,"Yes, and I'm okay with the fact that I'll experience pain, disappointment, or upset at times because that's a natural part of life.",false
76,Therapist,It seems like your values are interconnected and tell a story about what's important to you.,false
76,Client,"Yes, they do, and it's helpful to see how they all fit together.",false
76,Therapist,It was great speaking with you today.,false
76,Client,"Likewise, thank you for listening and offering encouragement; it meant a lot to me.",false
88,Therapist,"To begin, I'd like to explain that our program encourages participants to identify at least three goals they'd like to achieve within the next 30 days. We'll be monitoring your progress and checking in after 30 days to see how you're doing with your objectives. With that in mind, what are some areas in your life, either at home or school, where you'd like to see some positive changes?",false
88,Client,I really need to start getting to school on time for my first hour class; I always seem to miss it.,false
88,Therapist,"So, getting to your first hour class on time is a goal you're interested in working towards over the next 30 days?",false
88,Client,"Yes, that's right.",false
88,Therapist,That's a great objective. Can you help me understand what motivates you to want to achieve this goal for yourself?,false
88,Client,I guess it's because I don't want people constantly on my case about it.,false
88,Therapist,Who are the people you feel are pressuring you about this issue?,false
88,Client,"My mom is always telling me to get to school on time, and my probation officer says that if I don't, I could face sanctions and potentially have to go back into custody.",false
88,Therapist,Avoiding those consequences is clearly very important to you?,false
88,Client,"Yes, it is.",false
88,Therapist,"So, to confirm, getting to your first hour class on time is one of the goals you're committed to working on.",false
88,Client,I'll definitely try my best.,false
88,Therapist,What specific steps do you think you need to take in order to get to school on time for your first hour class?,false
88,Client,"My biggest challenge is waking up in the morning. By the time I finally get up and get ready, I've missed the bus, so then I have to walk or find another way to school.",false
88,Therapist,It sounds like there are several factors that can contribute to you being late.,false
88,Client,"Yes, it's not just one thing.",false
88,Therapist,"Given that there are multiple obstacles, what do you think would be the most effective strategy for you to get to school on time?",false
88,Client,Probably getting up on time would be a good starting point.,false
88,Therapist,What time would you need to wake up in order to catch the bus and make it to your first hour class?,false
88,Client,"If I want to catch the bus, I'd need to be up by 6:15, but that's really hard for me because I go to bed so late.",false
88,Therapist,"You're expressing some uncertainty about whether you can realistically achieve this goal, yet you're also saying you really want to try because of the potential consequences.",false
88,Client,"Right, I'll try and see how it goes.",false
88,Therapist,"So, you're willing to make an attempt at getting up earlier and getting to school on time?",false
88,Client,Yes.,false
88,Therapist,What bedtime would you need to establish in order to ensure you can wake up by 6:15 the next morning?,false
88,Client,"I currently go to bed around midnight, so maybe if I try going to bed by 11:00, that could work.",false
88,Therapist,"Okay, so you're considering going to bed at 11:00 and setting your alarm for 6:15 the next morning.",false
88,Client,"Yes, that's right.",false
88,Therapist,When would you like to start implementing this new routine?,false
88,Client,Either tomorrow or the day after.,false
88,Therapist,"So, should we plan for you to start tomorrow or the day after tomorrow?",false
88,Client,Let's start tomorrow.,false
88,Therapist,"Tomorrow it is, then. Who do you think could provide support and help you stay on track with getting to bed on time and waking up by 6:15?",false
88,Client,My mom could help me.,false
88,Therapist,Your mom. How can she assist you in sticking to this plan?,false
88,Client,"If my alarm goes off and I don't get up, she can come into my room and remind me that I committed to getting up at this time, so I'll have to follow through.",false
88,Therapist,"It sounds like you want your mom to hold you accountable for your own goal, rather than just doing it because she's telling you to.",false
88,Client,Exactly.,false
88,Therapist,What potential challenges might get in the way of you waking up by 6:15?,false
88,Client,Not going to bed on time is probably the biggest obstacle I'll face.,false
88,Therapist,"Not going to bed at your planned bedtime could definitely make it harder for you to get up on time. If you find yourself tempted to stay up later than you should, how do you think you could respond differently?",false
88,Client,"I can just go to bed and turn off the lights, without having my phone nearby.",false
88,Therapist,"So, removing distractions like your phone and creating a sleep-conducive environment by turning off the lights might help signal to you that it's time for sleep.",false
88,Client,"Yes, that's right.",false
88,Therapist,And having your mom check in on you could also provide an added layer of support.,false
88,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
88,Therapist,How will you know if your plan is working effectively?,false
88,Client,When I'm at school on time and in class when the bell rings.,false
88,Therapist,"So, being in your seat and ready to start class when the bell rings will be a clear indicator that you're achieving your goal. Let me summarize what we've discussed so far: you've identified getting to your first hour class on time as a key objective, motivated by a desire to avoid sanctions and reduce pressure from others.",false
88,Client,"Yeah, that's right.",false
88,Therapist,"You've developed a plan that includes going to bed by 11:00, setting your alarm for 6:15, and having your mom provide support. You're aware that staying on track with your bedtime will be crucial, and you have strategies in place to minimize distractions and stay committed to your goal.",false
88,Client,I hope it works out.,false
88,Therapist,"It sounds like you have a solid plan in place, and you're planning to start implementing it tomorrow.",false
88,Client,I'll give it a try.,false
88,Therapist,"Great, thank you for sharing your thoughts and working through this plan with me.",false
88,Client,You're welcome.,false
82,Therapist,"To better understand your feelings about alcohol and contraception, would you be willing to explore these topics through a self-evaluation?",false
82,Client,"Yes, that sounds okay with me.",false
82,Therapist,"We'll be using a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 represents ""not important"" or ""not confident,"" and 10 represents ""very important"" or ""very confident."" With that in mind, how important is it for you to stay within safe drinking limits?",false
82,Client,I'd rate it an 8.,false
82,Therapist,"You've rated it an 8. Now, on the same scale, how confident do you feel about your ability to drink below risk levels at this time?",false
82,Client,I would say a 4.,false
82,Therapist,"A 4. Can you help me understand what contributes to that level of confidence for you, considering you've mentioned the risk factors and family history of alcoholism?",false
82,Client,"Well, knowing my family's history with alcoholism and not wanting to follow that path gives me some confidence that I can make a change.",false
82,Therapist,That provides a strong motivation. Are there other factors that contribute to your confidence in managing your drinking?,false
82,Client,"Yes, having friends who don't drink and spending time with them makes it easier for me to stay within safe limits.",false
82,Therapist,"So, it seems you have a supportive social network that helps you maintain healthier habits. Is there anything else that contributes to your confidence?",false
82,Client,"No, that's about it.",false
82,Therapist,"Now, let's shift our focus to your use of birth control and the risk of pregnancy. On a scale from 1 to 10, how important is it for you to use effective contraception every time you have sex?",false
82,Client,I would say an 8.,false
82,Therapist,"An 8. And on the same scale, how confident are you in your ability to use birth control effectively and consistently?",false
82,Client,Probably a 6.,false
82,Therapist,A 6. What factors lead you to rate your confidence at a 6 rather than lower?,false
82,Client,"If I drink less, I think I'll be more reliable with using birth control. When I've had too much to drink, I'm less likely to use it.",false
82,Therapist,"So, there's a connection between your alcohol consumption and your consistency with birth control use. It seems addressing one issue could positively impact the other.",false
82,Client,"Yes, that makes sense.",false
82,Therapist,"It appears you have a good method of birth control but face challenges in using it consistently, which is linked to your drinking habits. Would you like to work on a plan to address your alcohol use before our session ends today?",false
82,Client,"Yes, okay.",false
82,Therapist,"And if you need any additional information or support, we can discuss that as well.",false
82,Client,"Okay, thank you.",false
91,Therapist,"Hello Jean, I'm Dr. Selby. It's a pleasure to meet you.",false
91,Client,"Good morning, doctor.",false
91,Therapist,What brings you here today? How can I assist you?,false
91,Client,"Well, doctor, after being diagnosed with COPD over three months ago, I've finally taken the step to make an appointment with you because I really need help quitting smoking.",false
91,Therapist,I understand. Can you tell me more about your diagnosis and how it's affecting you?,false
91,Client,"Yes, a respirologist diagnosed me, and to be honest, I'm really scared because I haven't been feeling well for a while now.",false
91,Therapist,I can sense your fear. It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge and face our challenges. Can you elaborate on what you're experiencing physically and emotionally?,false
91,Client,"I've been having coughing fits, even when I'm on the phone with customers, and it's really taking a toll on my daily life.",false
91,Therapist,"It sounds like your symptoms are significantly impacting your quality of life. Have you thought about quitting smoking before, or is this the first time you're considering it seriously?",false
91,Client,"I've tried to quit before using various methods like pills and patches, but nothing has worked so far.",false
91,Therapist,"I appreciate your honesty. It's clear that quitting smoking will be a challenging journey for you. Can you help me understand what makes smoking appealing to you, despite the health risks?",false
91,Client,"Smoking has been a part of my life since I was 13 or 14. It's something I associate with relaxation and socializing, especially after meals or when I'm stressed.",false
91,Therapist,"So, smoking serves as a coping mechanism for you, providing a sense of calm and connection with others. Is that correct?",false
91,Client,"Yes, that's right. It's also linked to my self-image and how I perceive myself in social situations.",false
91,Therapist,"I want to make sure I understand your perspective accurately. You've mentioned that smoking helps you relax, provides a sense of sophistication, and is tied to your social interactions. Is there anything else you'd like to add about the benefits of smoking for you?",false
91,Client,"Well, it's just something I enjoy doing, especially with my family and colleagues during breaks.",false
91,Therapist,"Now, can you tell me about the downsides of smoking for you? What are some negative aspects you've experienced or worry about?",false
91,Client,"The main concerns are my health and the financial burden. Smoking is expensive, and it's also affecting my appearance, making me look older than I am.",false
91,Therapist,"So, the negative consequences of smoking include the impact on your physical health, appearance, and finances. Is that a comprehensive list of your concerns?",false
91,Client,"Yes, those are the main issues.",false
91,Therapist,"On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the most important, how important is it for you to quit smoking at this point in your life?",false
91,Client,"I would say it's a 10. Quitting smoking is crucial for my health and well-being, and it's also important financially.",false
91,Therapist,"That's a strong motivation. Now, on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the most confident, how confident do you feel about your ability to quit smoking?",false
91,Client,"I'd say around 35 or 40%. I want to be more confident, but my past attempts have been unsuccessful.",false
91,Therapist,"You've expressed some self-doubt, but you're still hopeful. What do you think would help increase your confidence in quitting smoking, even if it's just a small increment, say from 40% to 45%?",false
91,Client,"Having support, perhaps through regular meetings or group sessions, could make a significant difference for me.",false
91,Therapist,That's a great point. Support systems can be incredibly helpful. I'd like to propose an exercise to help you become more mindful of your smoking habits. Would you be willing to monitor and record your smoking over the next week?,false
91,Client,"Yes, that sounds like a good idea. It might help me think more consciously about my actions and potentially resist some urges.",false
91,Therapist,"Exactly. By making your smoking habits more conscious, you may gain more control over them. I can provide you with a card to help track your progress.",false
91,Client,That would be helpful. I'll try to bring it back to our next appointment and discuss how it went.,false
91,Therapist,Excellent. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss or any questions you have before we conclude today's session?,false
91,Client,"No, I think that gives me a good starting point for now.",false
91,Therapist,"Well, thank you for sharing your story with me today, Jean. It's a brave first step towards change.",false
91,Client,"Thank you, doctor, for seeing me and listening to my concerns.",false
94,Therapist,"I'm glad we have this opportunity to explore whatever is on your mind today, and I'm here to listen without any specific agenda.",false
94,Client,"One issue that's been challenging for me is trying to motivate someone to take action, specifically to move out of my house.",false
94,Therapist,Can you tell me more about this situation so I can better understand what's going on?,false
94,Client,"I offered my home as a temporary solution, but now I'm struggling to assert myself and set boundaries around the end of this transitional period.",false
94,Therapist,"That was very kind of you to open your home to someone in need, and now it seems you're feeling ready to have your space back to yourself.",false
94,Client,"Yes, that's right; I want to make a change but find it difficult to express my needs directly.",false
94,Therapist,What do you think would help you feel more confident in asking this person to leave?,false
94,Client,"Honestly, I'm not sure; I care about the person and value having companionship, which makes it hard for me to decide what to do.",false
94,Therapist,It sounds like you're feeling torn between your desire for independence and your concern for this person's well-being.,false
94,Client,"Exactly; it's like I'm singing ""Hit the Road Jack,"" but not quite ready to mean it.",false
94,Therapist,"You're not quite at the point where you feel comfortable setting those boundaries, but using humor helps you cope with difficult situations.",false
94,Client,"Humor is essential for me; it's how I deal with life's challenges, and even comedians use it as a way to process their emotions.",false
94,Therapist,Your ability to find humor in tough spots is a strength that helps you navigate them more easily.,false
94,Client,"Yes, and it's something I rely on to get through difficult times.",false
94,Therapist,What are some potential benefits for you if this person were to move out?,false
94,Client,That's a good question; I'm having trouble articulating the benefits because I feel guilty about asking him to leave.,false
94,Therapist,Can you explore that feeling of guilt with me a bit more?,false
94,Client,"I think it's because I want to do the right thing and help people, which is an important value for me.",false
94,Therapist,"You've demonstrated your kindness by helping this person, but now it might be time to focus on your own needs.",false
94,Client,"Yes, I realize my job in supporting him is done, and now I need to work on being more assertive and confident in my decisions.",false
94,Therapist,How have you approached the conversation about him moving out so far?,false
94,Client,"We've had discussions, some of which haven't been easy, but I've tried to be logical and clear about my expectations.",false
94,Therapist,You mentioned earlier that he has other options for places to stay; can you tell me more about that?,false
94,Client,"Yes, that's true, and discussing those options with him makes me feel better because I know he has a safety net.",false
94,Therapist,Having those alternatives might make it easier for you to have the conversation about him leaving.,false
94,Client,Exactly; it gives me relief knowing he has other places he can go.,false
94,Therapist,"You might need to take concrete steps, like helping him pack or find his way to one of these new locations.",false
94,Client,I've been in similar situations before and have helped people transition to new living arrangements.,false
94,Therapist,When do you plan on taking the next step with him?,false
94,Client,"I've told him he needs to make a move within the next couple of days, as I have my own future plans and uncertainties about where I'll be living.",false
94,Therapist,"It can be scary to face the unknown, especially when it involves making significant changes.",false
94,Client,"Yes, it's frightening, but having someone else's needs to consider on top of my own makes it even more challenging.",false
94,Therapist,This person can feel like an added burden that you're carrying with you.,false
94,Client,That's a good way to put it; he is like an extra weight I'm carrying.,false
94,Therapist,But it sounds like you've made up your mind about what needs to happen next.,false
94,Client,"My goal is for him to be out within the next couple of days, and I'm trying to stay focused on that plan.",false
94,Therapist,I have a feeling your plans will come to fruition; it's just a matter of taking the next steps.,false
94,Client,I appreciate your support and perspective; it's helpful to talk through this with you.,false
97,Therapist,"Now that we've addressed your medication, I'd like to discuss your overall health, starting with your blood pressure, which is a bit elevated.",false
97,Client,That's right.,false
97,Therapist,I was wondering if we could take a few minutes to talk about your weight and how it might be impacting your health.,false
97,Client,What's the point of discussing that now?,false
97,Therapist,"I understand you've had to wait for 45 minutes, and I appreciate the time you've taken out of your busy schedule to be here today.",false
97,Client,"It's unacceptable to keep someone waiting that long, especially when they have a scheduled appointment.",false
97,Therapist,"You value punctuality and expect the same in return, which is understandable given your professional commitments.",false
97,Client,"As an accountant, I prioritize my clients' time and expect the same level of respect.",false
97,Therapist,"It can be challenging to balance work and personal responsibilities, especially when you're self-employed and have multiple tasks competing for your attention.",false
97,Client,"Exactly, I have accounts to manage, clients to meet, and not enough time for everything.",false
97,Therapist,"Given your hectic schedule, it's impressive that you've managed to carve out time for this appointment, despite the wait.",false
97,Client,"Yes, but I'm aware of my weight and its potential health implications, so I suppose it's worth discussing.",false
97,Therapist,"You're conscious of the need to address your weight, but feel constrained by your busy lifestyle and lack of time for exercise or healthy meal planning.",false
97,Client,"That's correct; as a self-employed accountant, my work demands a lot of time and energy.",false
97,Therapist,"It sounds like you're struggling to find a balance between your professional obligations and personal well-being, which can be overwhelming at times.",false
97,Client,"Yes, that's right; every moment counts when you're running your own business.",false
97,Therapist,"I want to acknowledge the challenges you're facing and explore ways to support you in making positive changes to your lifestyle, even if it's just a small step at a time.",false
97,Client,"Okay, I'm willing to listen and consider options, but I need to prioritize my work commitments.",false
97,Therapist,"Let's summarize what we've discussed so far: you lead a busy life, are aware of the link between your weight and health, and would like to make changes, but struggle to find the time.",false
97,Client,"That's a fair summary; my lifestyle is hectic, and food often becomes just fuel to keep me going.",false
97,Therapist,"If you could find a way to fit in some healthier habits, you'd be interested in exploring that further, despite the challenges it may pose.",false
97,Client,"Yes, I would, but it's not easy when you're juggling multiple responsibilities and trying not to drop anything.",false
97,Therapist,Would you be open to scheduling a follow-up appointment in a couple of weeks to discuss your progress and potential strategies for incorporating healthier habits into your lifestyle?,false
97,Client,"I'm willing to consider it, but I need to find a time that works for me and doesn't interfere with my other commitments.",false
97,Therapist,"To minimize waiting time, I could offer you an early morning appointment, such as 8:30 am, which would ensure we can start on time.",false
97,Client,That sounds like a good solution; I'll check my schedule and see what I can arrange.,false
97,Therapist,"Before our next meeting, take some time to reflect on your priorities and consider how you might be able to make small changes to your daily routine that could have a positive impact on your health.",false
97,Client,"Okay, I'll do that; it's been helpful talking through my challenges with you.",false
106,Therapist,"I've prescribed an antibiotic for Aiden's ear infection, but reviewing his chart, it's concerning to see he's had six or seven infections in the past year alone.",false
106,Client,"Yes, that's right.",false
106,Therapist,"It sounds like this has been a significant challenge for both of you, and I can imagine how stressful it must be, especially with Aiden getting upset.",false
106,Client,"Yeah, it's really tough on both of us; he gets very upset when he's not feeling well.",false
106,Therapist,One factor that might be contributing to these frequent ear infections is smoke exposure. Can you tell me about your smoking habits?,false
106,Client,"I do smoke, but I try my best not to smoke around Aiden; I make sure to go outside when I need to smoke.",false
106,Therapist,"Despite your efforts, the recurring ear infections suggest that Aiden might still be exposed to smoke. Could you help me understand what might be happening?",false
106,Client,"I'm not sure; I genuinely try to avoid smoking near him, and I don't smoke in the car or at home when he's around.",false
106,Therapist,"I strongly encourage you to consider quitting smoking for both your health and Aiden's. Smoking around children is linked to various serious health issues, including ear infections, potential need for ear tubes, vitamin deficiencies, dental problems, behavioral issues, asthma, and other respiratory infections. Additionally, children of smokers are more likely to become smokers themselves. Is that something you'd want for Aiden?",false
106,Client,"No, I don't want him to smoke; I've thought about quitting but find it extremely difficult.",false
106,Therapist,"Now might be the critical time to quit smoking, considering the risks it poses not just to Aiden's health but also to your own, including lung cancer, emphysema, oral cancers, and heart disease.",false
106,Client,"I'm aware of those risks; people have told me before, but quitting seems impossible to me.",false
106,Therapist,"Quitting has become more manageable with the variety of tools available today. We could explore nicotine replacement options like patches, lozenges, gum, inhalers, or nasal sprays, and there are medications such as Chantix or Zyban. Additionally, quit-smoking groups and hotlines can offer support.",false
106,Client,Finding time for all that seems challenging.,false
106,Therapist,"Given the importance of your child's health, it's crucial to prioritize this. Can you think of anything more important than ensuring Aiden's well-being?",false
106,Client,"I understand what you're saying; everyone faces challenges, but this feels particularly hard.",false
106,Therapist,What could be more critical to you than your child's health and safety? I need you to consider the urgency of quitting smoking.,false
106,Client,I'll look into those options and discuss them with my doctor to find something that might work for me.,false
106,Therapist,"It's essential to approach this decision seriously, considering the significant risks smoking poses to both you and Aiden.",false
106,Client,"Okay, I understand.",false
106,Therapist,Okay.,false
100,Therapist,What seems to be the primary concern that brings you here today?,false
100,Client,"I'm struggling to cope with my past criminal history and its impact on my life, making it difficult for me to stay on a positive path and become a productive member of society.",false
100,Therapist,It sounds like your criminal record is significantly hindering your progress towards your goals.,false
100,Client,"Yes, that's correct. It's frustrating because I feel like I've done everything right since then, but this one thing continues to hold me back.",false
100,Therapist,Can you tell me more about what specifically is blocking you from moving forward due to your criminal record?,false
100,Client,"Well, it's a felony conviction, which seems to be the major obstacle in my job search and overall rehabilitation.",false
100,Therapist,I understand. Having a felony conviction can indeed present significant challenges.,false
100,Client,"It feels like a life sentence rather than just the initial punishment. I've tried to better myself by going back to school and getting a degree, but it doesn't seem to matter when potential employers see my record.",false
100,Therapist,It must be very disheartening to face rejection after putting in so much effort to improve yourself.,false
100,Client,"Yes, it is. Especially when I feel like I have a lot to offer but am constantly being judged based on something that happened years ago.",false
100,Therapist,Have you considered discussing your criminal record openly with potential employers at the beginning of the application process?,false
100,Client,"Not really. I'm afraid it would immediately disqualify me from consideration, and I'd rather not waste my time or theirs if that's the case.",false
100,Therapist,"That makes sense. However, being upfront might save both parties time in the long run.",false
100,Client,Maybe you're right. It's just hard to know how to approach the situation without scaring off potential employers.,false
100,Therapist,"I see your point. Perhaps we can work on finding a tactful way for you to disclose this information early on, to avoid unnecessary disappointment later.",false
100,Client,That might be helpful. I just don't want to give them any reason to reject me outright before they even get to know me or my qualifications.,false
100,Therapist,Being an entrepreneur could offer you more control over your professional life and potentially bypass some of the biases you face in traditional employment.,false
100,Client,"Actually, starting my own business is something I've been considering. It would allow me to work independently and not have to worry about background checks or discrimination from employers.",false
100,Therapist,That's a very proactive approach. What kind of business are you thinking of starting?,false
100,Client,"Something related to event planning, possibly corporate events or wedding planning, where I can utilize my organizational skills.",false
100,Therapist,You seem to have a clear direction in mind. It might be beneficial to explore resources and support for individuals with felony convictions who are looking to start their own businesses.,false
100,Client,"Yes, that would be really helpful. Knowing there are organizations and communities out there that understand what I'm going through could make a big difference.",false
100,Therapist,"Let's also look into advocacy groups like the John Howard Society or the ACLU, which work on issues related to criminal justice reform and rehabilitation.",false
100,Client,"That sounds like a great idea. I've done some research for school on how these kinds of barriers can lead to higher recidivism rates, and it's really eye-opening.",false
100,Therapist,It's crucial to address these systemic issues to create a more supportive environment for rehabilitation and reintegration into society.,false
100,Client,Absolutely. Ignorance about the realities of the criminal justice system and its aftermath contributes significantly to the problem.,false
100,Therapist,I'm committed to helping you navigate this challenging situation and exploring options that can help you move forward positively.,false
100,Client,Thank you. Just talking about this has been helpful. I feel like I have a bit more direction now on how to proceed.,false
109,Therapist,"Now that we've completed the examination, I'm pleased to inform you that there are no cavities. However, I do want to discuss some concerns I have regarding the health of your mouth.",false
109,Client,"That's great to hear about the cavities, thank you.",false
109,Therapist,"I'm glad you're relieved about the cavities. Nevertheless, I've noticed some irritation in your mouth, specifically on the palate, which is known as nicotinic stomatitis. Can you tell me a bit more about your relationship with tobacco?",false
109,Client,Nicotinic stomatitis sounds like a serious condition.,false
109,Therapist,"Yes, it's a significant issue that can be caused by tobacco smoking. I'm interested in understanding how tobacco fits into your life at this point.",false
109,Client,"Well, I've never been a cigarette smoker, but when I socialize with friends at bars, we occasionally smoke those small cigarillos. I don't consider them cigarettes, and it's usually just one or two during an evening out.",false
109,Therapist,"It sounds like you've made a conscious decision to avoid smoking cigarettes due to concerns about their health effects. However, you have been smoking the little cigarillos when you're out with friends.",false
109,Client,"For me, it's more of a social activity that I do with my friends. We smoke them together when we're out, but it's not something I feel like I need to do regularly.",false
109,Therapist,"So, you don't identify as a heavy smoker, and the amount you smoke seems minimal to you.",false
109,Client,"Exactly, I'm not smoking packs of them every day or anything like that.",false
109,Therapist,"You're right, your smoking habits are different from those of a chain smoker. However, despite the relatively small amount you smoke, it's still causing damage to the roof of your mouth.",false
109,Client,"Now that you mention it, I have started smoking more frequently, even at work during breaks with friends who also smoke.",false
109,Therapist,"It seems like smoking has become a bigger part of your social life, both when you're out with friends and during work breaks.",false
109,Client,"Yes, now that you put it that way, I realize I am smoking on a daily basis.",false
109,Therapist,"Apart from the social aspect, what do you enjoy about smoking?",false
109,Client,"I find it relaxing, and it's nice to be around people while doing it. I also associate it with fun times, like when I visit Las Vegas and go to cigar bars.",false
109,Therapist,"Okay, I understand.",false
109,Client,"I still don't think of myself as a chain smoker, though.",false
109,Therapist,Have you noticed any negative effects from smoking that concern you?,false
109,Client,"Actually, I was going to ask about teeth whitening because I've noticed more stains on my teeth lately, and I suspect it might be related to smoking.",false
109,Therapist,"Yes, we have observed some negative effects on your oral health due to smoking. Are there other concerns you have about smoking?",false
109,Client,"Well, there's the expense, which is a concern for me, especially with the current economy. Buying more of these cigarillos than I used to is an added cost.",false
109,Therapist,"So, you're concerned about the impact on your oral health, the financial aspect, and you also mentioned earlier being aware of the health risks associated with cigarette smoking.",false
109,Client,"Yes, that's right.",false
109,Therapist,Were you aware that smoking those little cigarillos could have similar negative health effects as cigarettes?,false
109,Client,"No, I had no idea. I thought of it more as a fun, social activity rather than something harmful.",false
109,Therapist,It seems surprising to you that something you've been doing more frequently could be causing significant harm.,false
109,Client,"Yes, it is surprising. I didn't think of myself as a smoker and even checked ""no"" on your form when asked about tobacco use.",false
109,Therapist,"Now that you realize you are a tobacco user and that it might be causing serious health effects, how do you feel about this?",false
109,Client,I'm very concerned about the potential for developing cancer or other smoking-related illnesses. This conversation has made me realize I need to reconsider my habits.,false
109,Therapist,"The good news is that if you stop smoking, you can reverse the negative effects of nicotinic stomatitis and prevent further progression of any related diseases.",false
109,Client,Really? That's reassuring to know.,false
109,Therapist,Yes. Would you be interested in quitting?,false
109,Client,"Absolutely, I would like to quit, especially since I've only recently started smoking more regularly.",false
109,Therapist,"If you were to rate your confidence in being able to quit smoking on a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is not confident at all and 10 is very confident, how would you rate yourself?",false
109,Client,I'd say around 7 or 8. I feel pretty confident because it's not deeply ingrained in my daily routine.,false
109,Therapist,What makes you choose 7 or 8 instead of a lower number?,false
109,Client,"Because I don't smoke out of necessity, and it's not a huge part of my daily life. I think I could stop without too much difficulty.",false
109,Therapist,"So, to summarize, you've noticed negative effects from smoking, you're concerned about your health, and there are financial concerns as well. Yet, you feel fairly confident about quitting.",false
109,Client,That's right. I'd like to learn more about quitting and explore options that could make it easier for me.,false
109,Therapist,I can provide you with information on quitting strategies and resources that might help.,false
109,Client,"That would be great, thank you.",false
109,Therapist,Thank you for discussing this with me today.,false
109,Client,Thank you.,false
112,Therapist,"Chris, I wanted to touch base with you about your recent activities. As Athletic Director, it's my role to support our student athletes, and I've heard some concerns about a party you attended. Can you help me understand how partying and alcohol fit into your life right now?",false
112,Client,"Actually, I've been wanting to talk to someone about this. Before the party, I was feeling really overwhelmed with school and my parents have been keeping a close eye on me, which has limited my social life.",false
112,Therapist,I see.,false
112,Client,"About a month ago, my friends invited me to a party, and they used my studying habits as a reason for me to take a break. I convinced my parents I'd be sleeping over at a friend's house, and that's when I first started drinking. It was a new experience, and while it was fun in the moment, I've been struggling with it since.",false
112,Therapist,I understand.,false
112,Client,"This past weekend, instead of studying for an exam, I begged my mom to let me go to another party. She knew what I was up to and asked me to promise no alcohol or drugs, and that she'd pick me up by 12:00. I promised her, but I had no intention of keeping that promise.",false
112,Therapist,"So, here you are, an honors student and a star athlete, and it sounds like you've been exploring the party scene more recently.",false
112,Client,"Right. And at first, it was fun, but now I'm noticing some negative consequences.",false
112,Therapist,Can you tell me more about what you're experiencing?,false
112,Client,"Yeah, I've been feeling really lethargic and apathetic towards schoolwork. My mind is elsewhere, especially on weekends when I'm supposed to be studying.",false
112,Therapist,It sounds like your focus has shifted. What do you enjoy about drinking?,false
112,Client,"Honestly, it helps me relax and feel more comfortable around others. As a reserved person, it's easier for me to engage with people when I've been drinking.",false
112,Therapist,"So, drinking helps you loosen up and feel more at ease.",false
112,Client,"Exactly. But I'm also aware of the downsides – my mom is upset with me, my focus has decreased, and I'm not doing well in school.",false
112,Therapist,Those are significant concerns. Are there any other areas where you've noticed changes?,false
112,Client,"Yeah, my friendships have been affected. I've been hanging out with different groups of people who are into the party scene, and it's not fair to my old friends that I'm not as present for them.",false
112,Therapist,"I understand. Given all these changes, where do you think you should go from here?",false
112,Client,"Honestly, I feel like I should stop drinking or at least cut back significantly. I don't want to lose control and end up in situations that make me feel terrible.",false
112,Therapist,That makes sense. How important is it for you to make a change and regain your mom's trust?,false

112,Therapist,What makes you feel so determined to make this change?,false

112,Therapist,That's a great insight. What do you think is a realistic goal for you moving forward?,false
112,Client,"My goal is to focus on rebuilding my relationship with my mom, getting back on track with my studies, and finding ways to socialize without drinking. If I do find myself in a situation where there's alcohol, I'd like to limit myself to one drink at most.",false
112,Therapist,"That sounds like a solid plan, Chris. I appreciate you being honest with me about your struggles, and I'm glad we could have this conversation.",false
112,Client,Thank you for listening – it means a lot to me.,false

115,Client,"I know it's not easy to quit, but I feel like I need to be more motivated to try again.",false
115,Therapist,"That's a great point. Sometimes, having the right support and tools can make a significant difference. Would you be open to discussing how medication could help you this time around?",false
115,Client,"I guess I have to really want to quit, but my past experiences with medications haven't been helpful.",false
115,Therapist,"I understand your concerns, but it's crucial to consider the long-term benefits of quitting smoking. The potential side effects of medications are often minimal compared to the risks associated with continued smoking.",false
115,Client,"Okay, I'll think about it.",false
115,Therapist,"That's all I can ask for right now. It's essential to prioritize your health, and I'm here to support you in any way I can.",false

121,Client,"Exactly, I don't want to make huge changes, but small ones that I can stick to, like having an apple for breakfast.",false
121,Therapist,"Having a social aspect to your exercise routine can be really beneficial, so maybe we can explore some options like joining a club or team.",false
121,Client,"That's a great idea, I love the social aspect of being part of a team and it might give me the motivation I need to stay on track.",false
121,Therapist,"It's not about giving up things you enjoy, but about finding a balance that works for you and your health.",false
