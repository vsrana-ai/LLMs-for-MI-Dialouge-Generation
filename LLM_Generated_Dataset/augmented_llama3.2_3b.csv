6,Therapist,"Hi, Sal. Thanks for coming in today to talk about what's been going on and how you're feeling.",false
6,Client,No problem.,false
6,Therapist,"I appreciate your doctor referring you here, and I'm glad you took the time to make an appointment.",false
6,Client,"Yeah, it's a bit of an inconvenience, but I'm here now.",false
6,Therapist,"So, you made it in here today, and can you tell me what some of the concerns your doctor had that led her to refer you?",false
6,Client,"Honestly, I don't know - something about changing my life even more. The smoking's been changed, and now it's cut down on drinking, getting rid of those extra smokes, and getting rid of my dog.",false
6,Therapist,It sounds like there are a lot of changes being suggested to you right now.,false
6,Client,"Yeah, there's a lot of stress too. My wife is still on maternity leave, not getting paid, and she's with the baby most of the time. And I'm the only one working, so it's a big responsibility.",false
6,Therapist,That must be really overwhelming for you.,false
6,Client,"Yeah, it feels like everything is all over the place right now.",false
6,Therapist,Almost to the point where it's almost too much to handle.,false
6,Client,"Yeah, that's exactly how I feel.",false
6,Therapist,"Well, we have about 15 or 20 minutes together, and I was wondering if you'd be okay with taking a few minutes to look at all of these changes and see what would be the most helpful to focus on?",false
6,Client,"Yeah, it just feels like everything is all over the place, but I guess we can start somewhere.",false
6,Therapist,Okay. One tool we use is an agenda-setting worksheet that helps us prioritize things.,false
6,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
6,Therapist,"So, if you were to list all of the different things people around you are saying you need to work on or change, what would some of those things be?",false
6,Client,Okay.,false
6,Therapist,"Remember, this is just a way to put everything out there - it doesn't mean you have to make any changes right now.",false
6,Client,"Okay. Um, okay, that sounds good.",false
6,Therapist,"You're in the driver's seat here, so we're just going to put all the cards on the table.",false
6,Client,Okay. As long as I'm not changing anything and we're just kind of putting pen to paper or something.,false
6,Therapist,Yep.,false
6,Client,"Um, okay, so my asthma is one thing that's been bothering me.",false
6,Therapist,"Okay, so asthma is one area you'd like to address.",false
6,Client,Yeah.,false
6,Therapist,What else would you like to talk about?,false
6,Client,"Um, the fact that they want me to get rid of Oscar, that's my dog.",false
6,Therapist,So your dog is a big concern for you right now.,false
6,Client,"Which I don't buy - it's a main contributor to my asthma problems, but I know I can't just get rid of him like that.",false
6,Therapist,That must be really hard for you to hear.,false
6,Client,"Yeah. The dog has been there before my wife, and I know I've had him longer.",false
6,Therapist,So the loss of your dog is a huge stress right now.,false
6,Client,"Yeah. It's like my best friend, so that's one of the important things.",false
6,Therapist,And you're also working on quitting smoking completely?,false
6,Client,"Um, finances is a problem right now too.",false
6,Therapist,"Okay, so money is another area you'd like to address.",false
6,Client,"Time - I've got to come to all these appointments and I'm taking time off work, which obviously affects my income.",false
6,Therapist,Right. So the appointments and time away from work are impacting your finances.,false
6,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
6,Therapist,"And some of these things seem related to each other, right?",false
6,Client,"Yeah, yeah. Yeah, there's something going on.",false
6,Therapist,And you're also concerned about cutting down on drinking?,false
6,Client,"Yeah, my drinking is another thing I need to work on too.",false
6,Therapist,"Okay, wow. So there's a lot happening right now, Sal.",false
6,Client,No. It just feels overwhelming when you see everything they're saying.,false
6,Therapist,"Right. Well, if you had to pick one or two things to focus on in our time together today, where would you like to start?",false
6,Client,"I think the thoughts about the dog have been definitely bothering me, that's been one.",false
6,Therapist,Okay.,false
6,Client,And my asthma is out of control too. So maybe those two.,false
6,Therapist,Those are both related areas - sounds like we're on the right track.,false
6,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
3,Therapist,Can you help me understand what's behind your wife's concerns about your health habits?,false
3,Client,"I don't know, she just seems to be on my case a lot lately.",false
3,Therapist,It sounds like you feel like you're not seeing the issue from her perspective.,false
3,Client,"Yeah, I mean, I've been working hard and I feel fine.",false
3,Therapist,You mentioned that your job is physically demanding and you often work outdoors. Have you noticed any changes in your body as a result?,false
3,Client,"Well, I have gained a little weight, but nothing too noticeable.",false
3,Therapist,And when was the last time you visited the doctor for a check-up?,false
3,Client,"About a year ago, everything seemed fine.",false
3,Therapist,"But despite feeling good physically, you're still concerned about your wife's concerns.",false
3,Client,"Yeah, I guess so.",false
3,Therapist,It seems like you feel like your wife might be overreacting to this situation.,false
3,Client,"Not really, she just wants me to live a long time and be healthy.",false
3,Therapist,"I understand that. Sometimes, taking care of ourselves can make us feel better about our circumstances.",false
3,Client,"Yeah, going out to eat sometimes makes me feel a little better about my job.",false
3,Therapist,"Okay, well let's explore this further. Is there anything you'd like to know about obesity or diabetes?",false
3,Client,Sure.,false
36,Therapist,"Hello, Barbara. How are you today?",false
36,Client,"Yes, morning.",false
36,Therapist,"Good morning. My name is Dr. Betty, and I'm one of the new GPs in this practice. Can you tell me a little bit about what brings you here today?",false
36,Client,"Well, I've come about my tummy problem. I've got terrible trouble with my stomach and, uh, Dr. Brown just doesn't seem to be able to get to the bottom of it.",false
36,Therapist,I'm so sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about your symptoms? What's been going on with your stomach?,false
36,Client,"Um, well, I-I have this terrible discomfort nearly all the time. Um, it very often feels bloated. I, um, uh, I swing between being constipated and having diarrhea.",false
36,Therapist,That sounds really challenging for you. Can you describe what that feeling is like? Is there anything specific that's causing you distress?,false
36,Client,Mm.,false
36,Therapist,-and some of them sound quite troublesome to you.,false
36,Client,Yes.,false
36,Therapist,"Okay, let's explore this further. When did you first start noticing these symptoms, and have they changed over time?",false
36,Client,"Well, I, uh, I've traced it back to a holiday I had in Egypt about four years ago. I had, um, a horrible bout of sickness and diarrhea, and, uh, and I don't think my stomach's ever been really right since then.",false
36,Therapist,Mm-hmm. Okay. So you think this might be related to that trip?,false
36,Client,Yes. Yes.,false
36,Therapist,Okay. Have you tried any treatments or medications for your symptoms so far?,false
36,Client,"Well, uh, Dr. Brown gave me some muscle relaxants at the beginning.",false
36,Therapist,Mm-hmm.,false
36,Therapist,"-and Immodium in my handbag all the time, just in case. Yeah.",false
36,Client,"I have Immodium in my handbag all the time, just in case. Yeah.",false
36,Therapist,"Right. So, you're using these medications to manage your symptoms, but they haven't seemed to make a significant difference?",false
36,Client,Mm.,false
36,Therapist,"-and maybe trying to bring back some of those pleasurable things, you know, even if it's just meeting up with your female friends once a week, and whether actually doing those sorts of things might generally improve your quality of life.",false
36,Client,Mm.,false
36,Therapist,"What would you think about trying that slightly different approach for say-say two or three months, just to see whether or not it makes any difference?",false
36,Client,"Well, two or three months is a long time if there is something going on. I mean, that's what happened to my mother-in-law, you know.",false
36,Therapist,Right. How would that sound? Would you be willing to try this new approach and see how it goes?,false
36,Client,"Okay. Well, uh, to make an appointment for next week.",false
36,Therapist,"Yeah. And perhaps if you could also bring your tablets in or-or make a list of them, we can look at what you're taking and perhaps go from there.",false
36,Client,"Okay. Well, uh, to make an appointment for next week.",false
36,Therapist,Yes. I think so.,false
36,Client,All right. And I'll make a list of the tablets that I'm taking.,false
36,Therapist,Yeah.,false
36,Client,I won't bring all the bottles down.,false
36,Therapist,Okay. All right.,false
36,Client,Okay. All right. I'll do that.,false
36,Therapist,"So, shall I see you again next week?",false
36,Client,I'll make an appointment for next week. Yes.,false
36,Therapist,"Okay. All right. Thank you, Barbara.",false
36,Client,Okay. Thank you.,false
36,Therapist,Bye-bye.,false
33,Therapist,"Okay, David. So, why don't you take a rinse, and how are you feeling right now?",false
33,Client,"Hmm, I'm pretty good, thanks.",false
33,Therapist,Would you like to explore what's making you feel that way about rinsing the sink?,false
33,Client,"Check it out? Yeah, I'd like to see if it's fixed.",false
33,Therapist,"What do you think is going on with this sink, and how does it relate to your feelings?",false
33,Client,"Oh, that was fixed really nice. It looks great now.",false
33,Therapist,I'm glad to hear that the sink is looking good. Can we talk about what might have caused some discoloration in the first place?,false
33,Client,"Yeah, I think it's probably related to smoking, wine, and coffee – all of the above.",false
33,Therapist,That makes sense. Have you ever considered quitting smoking as a way to address this issue?,false
33,Client,"Yeah, I've thought about it. To be honest, I'm just not sure if it would work for me. I've tried before, but it didn't stick.",false
33,Therapist,"It can be tough when we're faced with advice from multiple sources, including doctors and loved ones. Can you tell me more about what's holding you back from quitting?",false
33,Client,"Yeah, yeah, yeah... it's just hard to quit when everyone keeps telling me I need to do it.",false
33,Therapist,I apologize if my words came across as judgmental or lecturing. That wasn't my intention.,false
33,Client,"Yeah, I know I'm not an idiot, and people know that smokers are a tough crowd – ""How can you smoke today?"" It's just hard to quit.",false
33,Therapist,I understand that it's not easy when we're faced with advice from multiple sources. Can you tell me more about your past experience with smoking?,false
33,Client,"I've smoked for 40 years, since I was 14, and I've tried quitting a couple of times in my 20s, but it's been consistent.",false
33,Therapist,That's a long time to be struggling with this habit. Can you tell me more about how smoking fits into your life right now?,false
33,Client,"No matter what kind of talk I get or what they come up with, I just can't see myself changing now.",false
33,Therapist,It sounds like you've tried many approaches in the past and haven't seen success. What do you think is holding you back from quitting for good this time around?,false
33,Client,Not gonna work for me.,false
33,Therapist,"Have you considered trying a different approach, such as cold turkey? Many people have found it to be effective.",false
33,Client,"Yeah, I've heard that before – and then they fight it. But it's my choice, and I don't like lectures about it.",false
33,Therapist,You're absolutely right; nobody has the right to tell you what to do. Can we explore a scenario where you decide to quit smoking? What would be the trigger for that decision?,false
33,Client,"Hard to tell – I already had open-heart surgery, and that didn't work. Prostate cancer didn't work either.",false
33,Therapist,I'm so sorry to hear that you've faced those challenges. Can we talk more about what's holding you back from quitting now?,false
33,Client,I just don't really want it.,false
33,Therapist,"So, this is something that you pretty much see yourself doing for a while – quite a while.",false
33,Client,"Yeah, a while... yeah.",false
33,Therapist,"Okay, well, I appreciate your willingness to talk about this. And I get that right now, this isn't something you want to pursue. Would it be okay if we brought it up in our next visit? I'm concerned about your health.",false
33,Client,"Okay, yeah – I could go for some listening. Yeah.",false
33,Therapist,As long as I don't talk too much?,false
33,Client,Yeah... [laughs],false
33,Therapist,"You're glad to keep your surgeon as a doctor, right?",false
33,Client,Yeah.,false
33,Therapist,"Well, David, wherever you're at, we'll work with it.",false
33,Client,Okay.,false
33,Therapist,Thanks for taking a couple of minutes and talking about smoking.,false
33,Client,"Thanks, doc.",false
45,Therapist,"Hi, Mary, how was your day?",false
45,Client,"It's been fine, I guess.",false
45,Therapist,You seem a bit preoccupied. Is there something on your mind that you'd like to talk about?,false
45,Client,"No, not really.",false
45,Therapist,"Okay, well, it seems like you had a busy morning at school. You missed your first hour of class today.",false
45,Client,"Yeah, I just didn't feel like going.",false
45,Therapist,It sounds like this isn't a big concern for you right now.,false
45,Client,"No, it's not.",false
45,Therapist,"So, what do you think is the point of our visits together?",false
45,Client,I don't know. Why are you asking me all these questions?,false
45,Therapist,I'm trying to understand your perspective and see if there's anything that might be helpful for you.,false
45,Client,"Yeah, I guess.",false
45,Therapist,Would it be okay with you if I explained again what this program is about?,false
45,Client,"Okay, I suppose.",false
45,Therapist,I want to make sure you know that my role as your caseworker is to support you and help you succeed.,false
45,Client,So you just want to know my business?,false
45,Therapist,"I can see how it might seem that way. But I assure you, my goal is to care about you and help you achieve your goals.",false
45,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
45,Therapist,"Some clients have struggled with understanding that I'm here to support them, not just monitor their behavior.",false
45,Client,Yeah.,false
45,Therapist,It's possible that you're feeling a bit overwhelmed by all the rules and expectations.,false
45,Client,Yeah. It's like there are too many rules.,false
45,Therapist,I can imagine how frustrating that must be for you.,false
45,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
45,Therapist,Some clients have found that having their freedom is more valuable than they realized when it was taken away.,false
45,Client,"Right, that's what I wish I had now.",false
45,Therapist,What would help you regain your freedom?,false
45,Client,Just not doing this again so I don't have to be stuck here.,false
45,Therapist,"That makes sense. If you can avoid committing another crime, you'll be able to move forward with your life.",false
45,Client,Yup.,false
45,Therapist,I appreciate it when you still sign the paperwork even though it's annoying at times.,false
45,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
45,Therapist,"Before I leave, is there anything else you'd like to share or discuss?",false
45,Client,"No, really.",false
45,Therapist,Just a reminder that I'll be back later today to check in with you again.,false
45,Client,All right.,false
45,Therapist,"Okay, well, take care of yourself for now.",false
45,Client,Bye.,false
42,Therapist,"Right, so you've hit a plateau in your weight loss and despite all the efforts to increase physical activity, it's not showing up on the scale?",false
42,Client,"No, I'm just feeling stuck and I don't know what I'm doing wrong because I keep trying different exercises.",false
42,Therapist,"So you feel like you're getting nowhere, no matter how hard you try to exercise or make changes.",false
42,Client,"Yes, it's frustrating.",false
42,Therapist,"And when you come home from the gym, do you find that your family members aren't offering the support you need?",false
42,Client,"No, they don't seem to care about my weight loss efforts at all.",false
42,Therapist,"It sounds like you feel like you're doing this alone, without anyone's encouragement or understanding.",false
42,Client,"Yes, I feel like I'm on my own with this.",false
42,Therapist,"Specifically, how does your father's perspective on your weight loss affect you?",false
42,Client,"He thinks that if I lose weight, I'll be disconnecting from our family and he wants me to focus on gaining weight back.",false
42,Therapist,That must be really tough for you. It sounds like he sees your weight loss as a threat to your relationship with him.,false
42,Client,"Exactly, it's like he doesn't understand that my goal is just to have a healthy body, not to fit into some idealized image.",false
54,Therapist,"Hello, Scott.",false
54,Client,Hi.,false
54,Therapist,We were discussing exercising earlier. Can you tell me more about that?,false
54,Client,"I want to get back into working out, but I've lost my motivation over the past couple of years.",false
54,Therapist,It sounds like you're feeling a bit stuck. What's holding you back from getting started again?,false
54,Client,"I just got busy and now I'm out of the habit. I feel like I need to get back in shape, especially since I've been gaining weight around my middle.",false
54,Therapist,"That makes sense. Let's make a list of reasons why you want to start working out again, and then we can brainstorm some ideas for how to help you get started.",false
54,Client,Okay...I guess that sounds like a good idea.,false
54,Therapist,Which gym do you belong to?,false
54,Client,"It's the Sport Fitness Center, just a couple of miles from my house.",false
54,Therapist,So it's relatively close. That might make it easier for you to find time to go.,false
54,Client,"If I walked that far, I probably wouldn't need to go to the gym at all.",false
54,Therapist,But regular exercise can have many benefits beyond just physical appearance. It can also improve your cardiovascular health and overall well-being.,false
54,Client,"Yeah, I know. I want to feel better and be healthier.",false
54,Therapist,That's a great goal. What do you hope to achieve by getting back into working out?,false
54,Client,I'd like to lose weight and feel more comfortable in my clothes again.,false
54,Therapist,It sounds like you're looking for a sense of confidence and self-improvement. Let's focus on finding ways to make exercise a sustainable part of your routine.,false
54,Client,"Yeah, that would be great.",false
54,Therapist,I want to emphasize the importance of taking care of your health over any aesthetic goals. Exercise can have a significant impact on both physical and mental well-being.,false
54,Client,"I know what you mean. I feel like I'm getting older, and it's time for me to make some changes.",false
54,Therapist,"It's never too late to start making positive changes in your life. You've shown that you can do it before, and with a bit of effort, you can get back into the habit.",false
54,Client,"Yeah, I know what to do.",false
54,Therapist,That's right. It might mean waking up an hour earlier each day or finding other ways to fit exercise into your schedule.,false
54,Client,I need to make time for it.,false
54,Therapist,"Exactly. And when we meet again next week, I'd like you to try experimenting with getting up a bit earlier and see how that works out for you.",false
54,Client,Okay.,false
54,Therapist,"Great. Just remember to bring the list of reasons why you want to start working out again, and we can work on finding ways to make it a sustainable part of your routine.",false
54,Client,Okay.,false
54,Therapist,I'll see you next week.,false
54,Client,"Okay, thanks.",false
54,Therapist,Bye for now.,false
54,Client,Bye.,false
57,Therapist,"Mr. Johnson, can I start by confirming that you're here to discuss your cholesterol and the medication prescribed by your doctor?",false
57,Client,Yeah?,false
57,Therapist,As my role is also to support you in understanding how to use your medication effectively and provide information on maximizing its benefits.,false
57,Client,"Well, I talked with my doctor about my medicine. That's his job.",false
57,Therapist,"While your doctor has provided guidance, my goal is to help you make informed decisions about your treatment plan.",false
57,Client,"Well, to be honest with you, I'm not even certain I'm going to take the medicine. Now, I know I got high cholesterol, I've got to get that down, but on the other hand, this medicine can cause some severe muscle weakness and I just can't afford that. I'm a truck driver and I haul those heavy boxes in on the dollies and I just can't afford that, so you know.",false
57,Therapist,"You're concerned about the potential side effects of the medication, particularly the muscle weakness, which is affecting your ability to do your job as a truck driver.",false
57,Client,"Yeah, down the line, but-",false
57,Therapist,"If left untreated, high cholesterol increases the risk of stroke or heart attack; would you like me to elaborate on that?",false
57,Client,"Well, right now it's the muscle weakness that-that I'm concerned about, and that's, uh, you know, that's the present, uh, I've got to do my job.",false
57,Therapist,"I understand your focus is on managing your current situation; however, it's essential to consider the long-term risks associated with high cholesterol.",false
57,Client,"Well, why don't you just give me the medicine, I'll take it home and I'll think about it? But you know, I'm worried about my job.",false
57,Therapist,"You need to take the medication regularly; if you experience muscle weakness, please inform your doctor, who can adjust your treatment plan as needed.",false
57,Client,Sure. Fine. Just—,false
57,Therapist,"The muscle weakness is a rare side effect, and there are measures in place to minimize its impact on your daily life.",false
57,Client,Whatever.,false
57,Therapist,Let's focus on the benefits of taking the medication; it will help you manage your cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of stroke or heart attack.,false
57,Client,"Okay, sure. Fine.",false
57,Therapist,"I want to emphasize that your health is a priority, and I'm here to support you in making informed decisions about your treatment plan.",false
57,Client,Okay.,false
72,Therapist,"Alright, Chris, I want to discuss this with you because our school has a zero-tolerance policy for drugs and alcohol. As athletic director, it's my responsibility to ensure all student-athletes follow that rule. I've heard rumors about a party this weekend, and although I don't have confirmation, I'm concerned.",false
72,Client,"Yes, actually, I want to talk to you about something that happened over the past weekend. Normally, as an honor student, I study on weekends and my parents won't let me attend parties, but I used that as leverage to convince them to go with friends who were pressuring me.",false
72,Therapist,I understand.,false
72,Client,"When I arrived at the party, I felt overwhelmed by the environment and the pressure to drink. I didn't want to be ostracized by my peers.",false
72,Therapist,"I get it. We've all been in similar situations. As a school, we have rules in place for a reason, and as a team member, you need to adhere to them.",false
72,Client,"I know that drinking is bad for me, both physically and mentally. It affects my performance on the field and puts me at risk of being ostracized by my friends.",false
72,Therapist,"You're feeling pressure from your peers, which can be challenging as a team leader.",false
72,Client,"Yes, it's hard to resist when everyone around me is doing it. I feel like I need to fit in with the group.",false
72,Therapist,"But you have a responsibility to set an example and lead by example, even in social situations.",false
72,Client,"That's true. If I don't drink, my teammates might see me as different or judgmental.",false
72,Therapist,"Maybe you can find ways to lead without drinking, like being the first one to leave parties or finding alternative activities with your friends.",false
72,Client,But what if they ridicule me for it? I'm just one person against a group of peers.,false
72,Therapist,"As your coach, my job is to support you in making good choices. We need to find a way to balance having fun with being responsible and adhering to the rules.",false
72,Client,"Okay, I'll make sure to limit my drinking and be more mindful of what I post online.",false
72,Therapist,That's a great start. Let's work together to find a solution that works for you and the team.,false
72,Client,I promise to be more responsible.,false
72,Therapist,"Alright, let's shake on it and move forward.",false
72,Client,Shake.,false
72,Therapist,"Alright, we'll catch up later.",false
72,Client,See you later.,false
63,Therapist,"So Tom, this infection has been quite painful for you, but we have antibiotics. If you take them faithfully for 10 days, I'm confident that your infection will be resolved. Can you commit to that?",false
63,Client,Definitely.,false
63,Therapist,And may I review the screening form you completed earlier today regarding drug use?,false
63,Client,Okay.,false
63,Therapist,"Let's examine it together. It indicates that on occasion, you use substances other than medical reasons. Which specific drugs do you use?",false
63,Client,I occasionally use meth.,false
63,Therapist,Do you typically snort or smoke it?,false
63,Client,Snort it; always snort it.,false
63,Therapist,Have you ever injected it?,false
63,Client,No.,false
63,Therapist,Are there any other substances you use besides meth and alcohol?,false
63,Client,Just some alcohol.,false
63,Therapist,How often do you use meth?,false
63,Client,Meth about two to three times a month.,false
63,Therapist,"So, you'd say you're an occasional meth user. You don't use it frequently?",false
63,Client,Right.,false
63,Therapist,Is snorting the only way you consume methamphetamine?,false
63,Client,Yes.,false
63,Therapist,"Given your situation, I want to discuss some health risks associated with Methamphetamine use. Your usage puts you in a category we consider risky. There are several consequences, including sexually transmitted diseases. Do you think your current STD might be related to your Methamphetamine use?",false
63,Client,"Yeah, it could be because I was high when I had unprotected sex and wouldn't do that if I weren't high.",false
63,Therapist,"You normally practice safe sex, correct?",false
63,Client,"Definitely, yeah.",false
63,Therapist,It seems like methamphetamine may have impaired your judgment during those instances.,false
63,Client,Yeah.,false
63,Therapist,Are there any other ways Methamphetamine is affecting you in your life?,false
63,Client,"No, I mean, no. I only do it in clubs with my friends, usually two or three times a month at most. I don't think it's really impacting me much. But I'm concerned about this one. I never expected to get gonorrhea.",false
63,Therapist,"I share your concern, and I'd recommend you stop using Methamphetamine altogether. There are several reasons for this, but that's my recommendation.",false
63,Client,"I understand, but it would be hard for me to do that. You know, meth is just a part of my social life and sex life.",false
63,Therapist,You recognize the problems associated with Methamphetamine and also see how much of your social life and sex life involves it. Quitting might be challenging.,false
63,Client,"Yeah, I don't think it would be easy but I'm not saying that I'm not willing to try.",false
63,Therapist,"If you were to consider quitting using Methamphetamine completely, with zero being not ready at all and 10 being fully committed, where would you place yourself?",false
63,Client,"Uh, three.",false
63,Therapist,Why not a one or two? What's holding you back from being more committed?,false
63,Client,"I mean, this has been really uncomfortable; gonorrhea is a bad experience. And when I'm on meth, I don't think the same way. And what I have now is bad enough; I could easily get AIDS or HIV. That scares me a lot.",false
63,Therapist,Are there any other concerns you have about Methamphetamine?,false
63,Client,"Well, I do just snort it but you don't know what it's cut with; there could be something really bad if it's mixed with something dangerous.",false
63,Therapist,"So, when we first discussed this, I thought you'd have little interest in quitting using Methamphetamine. However, it seems like you have several reasons why you want to stop. That's because of the risks associated with it, including getting a different STD.",false
63,Client,Yeah.,false
63,Therapist,What do you think would make it easier for you to reduce or quit using Methamphetamine?,false
63,Client,Something else to do on weekends; I need a different social life.,false
63,Therapist,How could you get that different social life?,false
63,Client,It's hard because almost everybody I know uses meth.,false
63,Therapist,Is there anyone in your life who doesn't use methamphetamine?,false
63,Client,My sister.,false
63,Therapist,Have you talked to her about your Methamphetamine use?,false
63,Client,"I haven't really talked to her about it. I think she knows; we're pretty close. I could talk to her, and I think she'd help.",false
63,Therapist,"On one hand, there are many positives from using meth, but on the other, there are reasons why you want to quit. There might be ways to make it easier, such as talking to your sister and getting support.",false
63,Client,Yes.,false
63,Therapist,"Well, great. I recommend not using Methamphetamine at all, but what you do is up to you.",false
63,Client,Okay.,false
63,Therapist,Would seeing me again in a month work for you?,false
63,Client,"Yeah, sure.",false
78,Therapist,"Hi, I'm Bruce Berger, and I work with patients who have asthma. Can you confirm your name is Julie Thompson?",false
78,Client,Yes.,false
78,Therapist,"Hi, I'm Bruce Berger. I noticed you're here to pick up a prescription for Sarah's rescue inhaler. Have you experienced any difficulties with her asthma in the last year?",false
78,Client,It's been really difficult. Seeing her gasping for breath and worrying about her trips to the emergency room is overwhelming.,false
78,Therapist,"I can see that it's causing you significant distress. You'd do anything to prevent those situations, right?",false
78,Client,Yes.,false
78,Therapist,I also noticed it's been a few months since you picked up Sarah's chronic inhaler prescription.,false
78,Client,Yes.,false
78,Therapist,Are you having trouble with the medication or any concerns about its use?,false
78,Client,"I researched the chronic inhaler and found out it contains steroids, which I'm not comfortable with. I looked into potential side effects and health problems associated with them and don't want Sarah to take those risks.",false
78,Therapist,You care deeply about Sarah's well-being and want to protect her from harm.,false
78,Client,Yes.,false
78,Therapist,Would you be open to discussing the chronic inhaler and its benefits in more detail?,false
78,Client,Yes.,false
78,Therapist,"The medication is not an anabolic steroid, but rather a corticosteroid that reduces inflammation in Sarah's lungs. It's designed to prevent her asthma symptoms without causing the same side effects as those steroids.",false
78,Client,I didn't realize they weren't the same thing.,false
78,Therapist,"You're concerned about the potential risks of steroids, which is understandable. However, this medication is specifically designed for people with asthma and has a much lower risk profile.",false
78,Client,That's reassuring to know.,false
78,Therapist,"When Sarah has an asthma attack, her lungs become extremely sensitive, like skin that's been burned off. This makes her react to even small particles in the air. The chronic inhaler can help reduce this sensitivity and prevent future attacks.",false
78,Client,"Oh, I see what you mean now.",false
78,Therapist,Using the chronic inhaler regularly can make a significant difference in Sarah's symptoms and reduce her need for rescue medication.,false
78,Client,That sounds great.,false
78,Therapist,"Additionally, even though you're smoking outside, the smoke on your clothes can still affect Sarah's lungs. If you use the chronic inhaler as directed, she may not be as sensitive to smoke on your clothes.",false
78,Client,Even when it's just on my clothes?,false
78,Therapist,"Yes, her sensitivity is quite high. However, if she's using the chronic inhaler, the risk of a reaction from smoke on your clothes should decrease significantly.",false
78,Client,I'll keep that in mind.,false
78,Therapist,Quitting smoking would be beneficial for both you and Sarah. It would greatly reduce her asthma symptoms and improve her overall health.,false
78,Client,"Yeah, it is difficult to quit.",false
78,Therapist,"If you're willing to try quitting, we can work together to support you. In the meantime, using the chronic inhaler as directed will help manage Sarah's asthma.",false
78,Client,Okay.,false
78,Therapist,Let's focus on getting both prescriptions ready and using the chronic inhaler every day. We'll also keep an eye on how it affects Sarah's symptoms and adjust as needed.,false
78,Client,That sounds good.,false
78,Therapist,I'm glad we can work together to help Sarah manage her asthma. Thank you for your cooperation.,false
78,Client,Thank you.,false
93,Therapist,"As we explore different directions for our session, I'd like to clarify that you've mentioned wanting to make changes in your physical activity, eating habits, and body confidence. Can you help me understand what's driving your desire to focus on physical activity as a potential starting point?",false
93,Client,"I feel like it's the most accessible area for me to begin with, and if I can establish an activity routine, that might create opportunities for other changes in my nutrition and overall well-being.",false
93,Therapist,That makes sense. Physical activity is feeling like the easiest place to start.,false
93,Client,"Yes, I think so.",false
93,Therapist,"What motivates you to get started with physical activity? You've mentioned energy levels, improved mood, and reducing stress – are there any other benefits that resonate with you?",false
93,Client,"For me, it's about feeling stronger and more capable. Last night, struggling with opening a jar of salsa was a big deal for me, so I think being more active would help with everyday tasks like that.",false
93,Therapist,"So, physical strength is an important aspect of your motivation. You also hope to improve your body image and confidence.",false
93,Client,"Exactly. If I'm more active, I believe my body image will improve too.",false
93,Therapist,"On a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 means you're not ready to make a change in physical activity and 10 means you're fully committed, where do you fall?",false
93,Client,I'd say an 8 – I'm feeling fairly motivated.,false
93,Therapist,You're close to being fully on board. What's holding you back from choosing a higher number?,false
93,Client,"I've identified many benefits of being more active, including improved mood, energy, and self-confidence. That's what's driving my motivation.",false
93,Therapist,It sounds like the potential benefits are overwhelming you – there's too much to gain from physical activity.,false
93,Client,"Yes, that's true.",false
93,Therapist,Am I missing any other aspects of your motivation?,false
93,Client,I don't think so.,false
93,Therapist,"Okay, those seem to be the main drivers for you. Now we can start exploring how physical activity might look in your life and what activities you might enjoy.",false
93,Client,That sounds great.,false
93,Therapist,Let's dive into that.,false
90,Therapist,"I wanted to talk to you about some concerns I saw on Facebook that made me think of you, Tommy. You're a good kid, and I'm worried that drinking might be affecting your life in ways you're not seeing right now.",false
90,Client,"I was just at a social gathering with friends, and we were all having fun together. It wasn't like I was looking for trouble; the drinks were there, and everyone was doing it.",false
90,Therapist,"I understand that, but there are so many consequences to drinking, especially when you're underage. You could get arrested, have a drunk driving accident, or mess up your schoolwork. Your future is bright, and I'm concerned about what might happen if you keep drinking.",false
90,Client,"I know where you're coming from, but I felt like I had it under control that night. I didn't want to be the one who got out of hand, so I made sure my friends were okay too.",false
90,Therapist,It's hard to say when someone is truly in control – anything that involves drinking when you're underage is a concern for me. Let's think about all the potential risks and consequences together.,false
90,Client,"Yeah, I understand what you're saying. And I do want to make sure my friends are okay too.",false
90,Therapist,How much were you drinking at this party?,false
90,Client,"To be honest, I don't think it was that much; it was mostly for social gatherings, not something I'd do alone or out of control.",false
90,Therapist,Was it every weekend?,false
90,Client,"Every other weekend, I guess. But I can see how that might be a concern.",false
90,Therapist,"Tommy, I'm really worried about you – is there anything better to do with your time?",false
90,Client,"Actually, I think I can find more productive ways to spend my time, like focusing on schoolwork and hanging out with other kids who share similar interests. Maybe I've been influenced by the wrong crowd.",false
90,Therapist,You're right; sometimes things seem fun in the moment but aren't good choices later. We talk about making good choices for our lives all the time. Can we work together to come up with a plan that will help you stop drinking?,false
90,Client,"Yeah, I think that would be a great step forward – maybe being sober and experiencing life more fully.",false
90,Therapist,"Okay, let's make a plan to get you in control of your drinking.",false
90,Client,That sounds like a good idea.,false
108,Therapist,"I want to start by thanking you for being here today and sharing your concerns with me. It sounds like you have a lot on your plate, juggling work, school, and taking care of your two-year-old son. Can you tell me more about what's been going on?",false
108,Client,"Well, um, I have a two-year-old son, and then I work full time as a server at a restaurant, and then recently, I also started going back to night class, so you know, just the combination of all that, you know. I-I've just been feeling really stressed lately.",false
108,Therapist,I can see why you'd feel overwhelmed. It sounds like you're shouldering a lot of responsibility on your own. Are you a single mom?,false
108,Client,Yeah.,false
108,Therapist,"So, with three major stressors in your life right now - being a single mom, working full-time, and going back to school - what do you think would be the most helpful for us to focus on today?",false
108,Client,"Well, I-I told the counselor that I think childcare is probably my-my biggest issue right now.",false
108,Therapist,Can you tell me more about why childcare is such a challenge for you?,false
108,Client,"Yeah. Um, well, my mom normally watches my son, but lately, it's kind of becoming a problem. You know, she like will back out at the last second, and so I've had to call in at work a couple of times. I've had to miss class a few times. So i-it's just stressful worrying about, you know, whether I'll be able to do those things or not.",false
108,Therapist,It sounds like your mom's reliability is causing you a lot of anxiety. Have you considered reaching out to other family members or friends for support?,false
108,Client,"Um, well, I have a sister, but I don't really trust her to watch my son, and I don't really know that many people that-- the only thing I can think of, I have this one neighbor who stepped in and helped one time when my mom backed out. She-she actually has, uh, a three-year-old daughter, so you know, kind of worked out.",false
108,Therapist,"So, it seems like your neighbor might be someone you could rely on for childcare support. What do you think about exploring that further?",false
108,Client,"Um, I don't really know her that well, but I mean, she seems nice and I-I think she did a pretty good job that night.",false
108,Therapist,It sounds like your neighbor was supportive when you needed her to be. Have you considered how having someone reliable for childcare could help reduce your stress levels?,false
108,Client,Yeah.,false
108,Therapist,"Stepping in last minute can be really helpful, but it's also important to think about long-term solutions. What do you think would happen if you had a plan in place with your neighbor and mom that worked out?",false
108,Client,"Um, well, you know, if my neighbor could even just take over one day of watching my son, I think that would help my mom quite a bit.",false
108,Therapist,"So, it seems like having a reliable childcare solution could make a big difference for both you and your mom. Have you thought about how that might impact your school schedule or work commitments?",false
108,Client,"Mom, you know, just, I guess talking to my neighbor and seeing if she's even interested in this idea, and if she is, you know, telling my mom about it and, you know, hopefully, that will make her feel a little better and maybe a little bit more reliable.",false
108,Therapist,It sounds like you have a plan to follow up on with your neighbor. What do you think would be the next step in making this work?,false
108,Client,"Um, well, I guess just first talk to my neighbor and see if she likes this idea, and then if she does, I can talk to my mom about it. Hopefully, that kind of helps her situation out.",false
108,Therapist,"Okay, let's make a plan to revisit in two weeks and see how things are going. In the meantime, have you considered looking into local Head Start programs for childcare?",false
108,Client,"I've heard of it, but I don't know that much.",false
108,Therapist,Head Start is a great option for affordable and high-quality childcare. It's designed specifically for families like yours who need support. Would you be interested in learning more about it?,false
108,Client,"Yeah, I mean, it sounds like it would be really good for my son and, you know, it would help me out in terms of childcare for sure.",false
108,Therapist,"That's great to hear. We can definitely look into that further. Finally, how are you doing with your efforts to reduce smoking and drinking?",false
108,Client,"[chuckles] Well, you know, I-I've been working on it a couple of weeks now, and honestly, it's been a lot harder than I expected. Um, trying to break my routine in the evenings, especially has-has been hard, but, um, you know, a couple of nights I have reached my goal in terms of, you know, number of cigarettes I'm going to smoke and number of drinks.",false
108,Therapist,It's great that you're committed to making progress. Have you thought about how secondhand smoke might be affecting your son?,false
108,Client,"Yeah, yeah. I definitely have, so I-I try to never smoke around him, and if I do smoke at home, I always go out to the balcony to smoke.",false
108,Therapist,That's responsible of you. Let's summarize what we've discussed today. We've got two potential solutions for childcare - exploring a plan with your neighbor and looking into local Head Start programs. What do you think would be your next steps?,false
108,Client,"Um, well, I guess just first talk to my neighbor and see if she likes this idea, and then if she does, I can talk to my mom about it. Hopefully, that kind of helps her situation out.",false
108,Therapist,Sounds like a plan. Let's schedule our next session for two weeks from now and revisit how things are going.,false
99,Therapist,"Before we conclude our session today, I'd like to discuss your drinking habits with you. Can you tell me more about that?",false
99,Client,"Okay, what do you want to know?",false
99,Therapist,"You completed a survey for us earlier, which was greatly appreciated. As I reviewed it, I noticed some discrepancies in your answers. Specifically, you mentioned drinking two to three times a week, but then stated having six or more drinks on a weekly basis.",false
99,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
99,Therapist,Does that sound like an accurate representation of your drinking habits?,false
99,Client,"Yeah, uh, mostly on the weekends?",false
99,Therapist,I'm concerned about your level of drinking. Excessive consumption can exacerbate existing issues and even lead to health problems. Have you considered how your drinking might be connected to your anxiety and insomnia?,false
99,Client,"No, I guess I haven't really thought about it.",false
99,Therapist,Mm-hmm.,false
99,Client,-so I have a hard time believing that it's causing my anxiety.,false
99,Therapist,Mm-hmm.,false
99,Client,"In fact, on the nights when I don't drink, I-I have a harder time going to sleep.",false
99,Therapist,"It's interesting that you mention this. Many people believe drinking helps them fall asleep better, but in reality, it can lead to a rebound effect where you wake up frequently during the night.",false
99,Client,"Well, I, yeah, I guess I do have about 2:00 AM, I tend to wake up on the nights I drink too much.",false
99,Therapist,"Mm-hmm. According to your age and sex, you're drinking more than the recommended low-risk level for men under 65.",false
99,Client,"Jeez, no. I didn't think I was that bad.",false
99,Therapist,"That's why it's helpful to look at this data objectively. On a scale of 1-10, how ready are you to make changes regarding your drinking?",false
99,Client,"I don't know. I mean, this is all new information for me. I've always thought of myself as healthy, but now I'm not so sure.",false
99,Therapist,That's okay; it's a good starting point. What kept you from choosing a lower readiness level?,false
99,Client,"Well, you know I'm training for the marathon, and that's why I'm here, is because I need to get my sleep back on track, but I also don't think of myself as a hazardous drinker.",false
99,Therapist,"Mm-hmm. Okay. So, it seems like your health and running are important to you, and you're surprised by the results.",false
99,Client,Yes.,false
99,Therapist,"Based on all that information, what changes would you be willing to consider making right now?",false
99,Client,"Well, I-I think the natural thing would be to cut back a little on my drinking.",false
99,Therapist,"Mm-hmm. So, how would that look for you in terms of limiting your drinking?",false
99,Client,"Mm, um, maybe three or four times a week, and-and on weekends, no more than five or six beers.",false
99,Therapist,"Okay, let's put this into perspective. If you were to write down your goals regarding your drinking, what would they look like?",false
99,Client,"Um, doing the math, I guess no more than 18 drinks a week.",false
99,Therapist,"That's an improvement. You're headed in the right direction. Remember, with 18 drinks a week, you're still above the recommended low-risk level, but it's a good starting point.",false
99,Client,Thanks.,false
99,Therapist,"Before our next appointment, I'd like to check in on your progress and see how you're doing.",false
99,Client,Sure.,false
99,Therapist,Okay. Good.,false
102,Therapist,"Hi, Liz. It's great that you've taken the time to meet with me today.",false
102,Client,Sure.,false
102,Therapist,Can you tell me what's been on your mind lately and something you'd like to work towards?,false
102,Client,"Well, I've been thinking about working out again. I really want to start exercising regularly. The idea has been stuck in my head, and I feel like I need to make a change.",false
102,Therapist,"It sounds like this is something that's been weighing on you, and you're feeling a bit stuck.",false
102,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
102,Therapist,"I sense that you've been thinking about this a lot, and it's becoming increasingly important for you. You feel like you need to make some progress soon.",false
102,Client,"Well, I don't know if I'm being lazy, but I think my schedule is just too busy.",false
102,Therapist,That makes sense. It can be challenging to find time for exercise when life gets busy.,false
102,Client,"Yeah, that's true. I just need to figure out how to fit it in somehow.",false
102,Therapist,"I understand that finding the time and motivation can be a challenge. However, having a gym membership suggests you're committed to making this change happen.",false
102,Client,"But even if I go three or four times a week, an hour is a long time – it's not realistic for my schedule.",false
102,Therapist,It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed by the idea of dedicating that much time to exercise. You're thinking about the practicalities and how it might impact your daily routine.,false
102,Client,"Exactly. If I'm working out for an hour, that means I'll be leaving home, traveling there, and then back – it's not just an hour.",false
102,Therapist,"It seems like you need to find a way to make exercise fit into your schedule without feeling overwhelmed. You want to see results, but you're not sure where to start.",false
102,Client,"Well, okay.",false
102,Therapist,I'm looking forward to hearing about your progress tomorrow and seeing if we can work together to find a solution that works for you.,false
102,Client,Okay.,false
102,Therapist,"Thanks for being open with me today, Liz.",false
7,Therapist,"So I understand that you sprained your ankle yesterday, and I'm curious to know more about what happened leading up to it.",false
7,Client,"To be honest, it was a pretty silly mistake. I was at a pub crawl last night, and I got caught up in the moment with my friends. We were all having a great time, but I think I might have overestimated my ability to navigate the stairs in those stilettos.",false
7,Therapist,It sounds like you're still feeling a bit embarrassed about it.,false
7,Client,"Yeah, it was pretty embarrassing. But at the same time, we did have a lot of fun, and I'm just glad no one got hurt badly.",false
7,Therapist,"That's understandable. So, now that you've had some time to reflect on what happened, are you willing to explore your drinking habits and how they might be contributing to this incident?",false
7,Client,"Yeah, sure. As long as we don't get too deep into the specifics of vodka, I'm okay with that.",false
7,Therapist,"Of course not. So, can you tell me a bit more about what a typical week looks like for you in terms of your drinking habits?",false
7,Client,"Well, my friends and I usually party on the weekends, and it's just kind of normal for us to have a few drinks. We're all university students, so we tend to fit in with that crowd.",false
7,Therapist,"So, having a few drinks isn't unusual for you.",false
7,Client,"No, not at all. It's more like seven or eight drinks if we go out hard, and then maybe one or two beers when I get home from school.",false
7,Therapist,That sounds like a lot. Are there any concerns about your drinking habits that you're aware of?,false
7,Client,"Honestly, no. I just think it's normal for university students to drink like that.",false
7,Therapist,"Okay, so you don't see anything problematic with your current drinking habits.",false
7,Client,"Yeah, not really.",false
7,Therapist,Would you be open to looking at some guidelines for low-risk drinking and seeing how they might apply to you?,false
7,Client,"Yeah, sure. I'd be willing to take a look.",false
7,Therapist,Let's just take a quick glance at these guidelines real quick.,false
7,Client,Okay.,false
7,Therapist,"For women, the safe limits are about 10 drinks per week, with two drinks per day.",false
7,Client,"Wow, that does seem like a lot.",false
7,Therapist,Where do you think you fall into those guidelines?,false
7,Client,"I'd say I'm just over that limit, especially with midterms coming up.",false
7,Therapist,So it sounds like drinking is a way for you to cope with stress.,false
7,Client,Yeah. It's definitely something I've relied on in the past.,false
7,Therapist,Is that something that has been going on for a while?,false
7,Client,"Yeah, I guess so.",false
7,Therapist,Does that concern you at all?,false
7,Client,"A little bit, yeah. I mean, 10 drinks seems like a lot for me, and I've kind of built up my tolerance over the years.",false
7,Therapist,That might be a concern for you.,false
7,Client,"Yeah, it's definitely something to think about.",false
7,Therapist,Is there anything that would motivate you to reduce your drinking within those guidelines?,false
7,Client,"Health reasons, mostly. I feel really unproductive when I have a hangover, and I see the benefits of not drinking as much.",false
7,Therapist,So you can see some advantages to reducing your drinking.,false
7,Client,Yeah.,false
7,Therapist,"Would you be willing to explore this further with me at another time, maybe when you're feeling a bit better?",false
7,Client,Yeah. Maybe when I haven't had a wild night like last weekend and sprained my ankle.,false
7,Therapist,That sounds good. Let's set up an appointment for later this week or early next week.,false
7,Client,Okay.,false
7,Therapist,"We can explore some of those benefits of reducing your drinking within the safe limits, okay?",false
7,Client,"Sure. Just not on a Saturday morning, though. [chuckles]",false
7,Therapist,That's perfectly fine with me.,false
7,Client,Okay.,false
7,Therapist,Thank you for being open to this conversation.,false
7,Client,Yeah. Sounds good.,false
22,Therapist,"I'd like to start by acknowledging that you've completed your values clarification handout, and we'll be exploring those further today. Can you tell me more about what some of your top values are for you?",false
22,Client,"Yes, my top value is family happiness, especially now.",false
22,Therapist,That's a significant priority for you right now. How often do you revisit your core values to ensure they haven't changed over time?,false
22,Client,"I usually do this every two to three months, and each time it has changed.",false
22,Therapist,"So, currently, family value is the most important thing to you.",false
22,Client,"Yes, that's true, especially since my family hasn't been on the same page as me.",false
22,Therapist,"Can you elaborate on what you mean by ""not being on the same page""?",false
22,Client,"It means we don't always see eye-to-eye, so I've had to find ways to be more present and listen to each other better.",false
22,Therapist,"That makes sense. Even though family happiness is crucial to you, it's possible that your loved ones may not be aware of its importance to you.",false
22,Client,"Yes, exactly. I want them to know how much it means to me, especially now.",false
22,Therapist,Are you hoping they'll understand and make an effort to prioritize family happiness as well?,false
22,Client,"Yes, I'd like them to know how important it is to me, and that's why I do this values clarification every two to three months.",false
22,Therapist,"It sounds like your faith has been a significant part of your life in the past, but something changed recently that made you reevaluate its importance.",false
22,Client,"That's right. With a big situation happening in my family, I lost touch with my faith for a while, and it was hard to deal with the judgment from others.",false
22,Therapist,"It can be challenging when we face challenges and feel like we're losing our way. But it sounds like you've come to accept that your faith is still present, even if it's not as prominent as it once was.",false
22,Client,"Yes, I've accepted that my faith is still there, but it's not as central to me right now.",false
22,Therapist,"So, family happiness has become more of a priority for you, and you're looking for ways to nurture that value in your life.",false
22,Client,"That's correct. Family happiness is the most important thing to me right now, especially since I feel like we haven't been on the same page as much lately.",false
22,Therapist,"It can be tough when our priorities shift, but it sounds like you're committed to prioritizing family happiness moving forward.",false
22,Client,"Yes, I am. And I think that's what I've learned from doing these values clarification handouts – my values change over time, and that's okay.",false
22,Therapist,That's a great insight. It's normal for our priorities to shift as we grow and experience new things. You're recognizing that your values are not static and can evolve over time.,false
22,Client,Exactly. And I think that's helped me become more open-minded and accepting of change in my life.,false
22,Therapist,"That's wonderful. It sounds like you've been able to develop a greater sense of inner harmony, health, security, inner harmony, health, and security are all important values for you, but family happiness and religion take priority right now.",false
22,Client,"Yes, that's correct. Inner harmony, health, and security are still important to me, but I feel like I've been neglecting them lately.",false
22,Therapist,"It can be challenging when we're focused on taking care of others, but it sounds like you're recognizing the importance of prioritizing your own inner harmony and well-being.",false
22,Client,"Yes, that's true. And I think that's what I need to focus on – finding more time for myself and my own needs.",false
22,Therapist,That makes sense. It can be hard to achieve inner harmony when we're constantly running around taking care of others. But it sounds like you're willing to make a change and prioritize your own needs.,false
22,Client,"Yes, I am. And I think that's what I've learned from doing these values clarification handouts – my values are not static, and I need to be more intentional about prioritizing them in my life.",false
22,Therapist,That's a great takeaway. It sounds like you're recognizing the importance of being present and mindful in your relationships with others.,false
22,Client,"Yes, that's true. And I think that's what I've been missing – being more present and listening to each other better.",false
22,Therapist,"That's a wonderful insight. It can be challenging when we're not present, but it sounds like you're committed to making a change and prioritizing your relationships moving forward.",false
22,Client,"Yes, I am. And I think that's what I need to focus on – finding more time for myself and my own needs, as well as being more present in my relationships with others.",false
22,Therapist,"Okay, it sounds like you've been through a significant life change that has shifted your priorities and values. Can you tell me more about what happened?",false
22,Client,"Yeah, something dramatic happened that shocked me out of my previous way of living and made me realize I needed to take care of everyone else first.",false
22,Therapist,"That can be a challenging experience, but it sounds like you've come to accept the new reality and are looking for ways to prioritize your values moving forward.",false
22,Client,"Yes, I am. And I think that's what I need to focus on – finding more time for myself and my own needs, as well as being more present in my relationships with others.",false
22,Therapist,"Okay, it was great talking to you about your values and priorities. If there's anything else you'd like to work on or discuss in the future, feel free to let me know.",false
22,Client,Thank you for listening.,false
22,Therapist,You're welcome.,false
28,Therapist,"Hi Carrie, thanks for coming in today to talk about your struggles with smoking.",false
28,Client,"Thank you, my doctor, I'm here because I need help quitting.",false
28,Therapist,What brings you in today?,false
28,Client,"Well, I've been having a hard time quitting smoking and trying to quit for a long time.",false
28,Therapist,"So, you'd like to give up those cigarettes and live a healthier life.",false
28,Client,"Oh, I've wanted to do that for years, but it's just so hard.",false
28,Therapist,"Yeah, so then it's really important to you to quit now because of your health issues and being a good mom to your 15-year-old daughter.",false
28,Client,"Yes, my daughter is very against smoking and I don't want to be a bad influence on her. Plus, I'm getting older and have asthma, chronic bronchitis, and it's hard for me to breathe when I exercise.",false
28,Therapist,That sounds really tough. It feels like you're being shunned by society because of your smoking habit.,false
28,Client,"Actually, it feels like I'm the one who's being ostracized – my friends and family don't understand why I still smoke despite knowing the risks.",false
28,Therapist,"So, you feel like you need to quit not just for your health but also to be a good role model for your daughter and avoid embarrassing her in front of her friends.",false
28,Client,Exactly. She's been expressing how much she dislikes smoking and it makes me feel embarrassed too.,false
28,Therapist,"Okay. It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure from your daughter, as well as your own health concerns, to quit smoking.",false
28,Client,"Yes, I've tried Chantix before but had some bad side effects, which made it hard for me to stick with it.",false
28,Therapist,What kind of side effects did you experience?,false
28,Client,"I had nightmares, nausea, stomach problems, and agitation. It was really tough and didn't help me quit smoking.",false
28,Therapist,Those sound incredibly challenging. It's like your body is telling you that quitting is the right thing to do.,false
28,Client,That's exactly what it feels like – my body is craving nicotine and I feel like a chocoholic craves chocolate when I'm not smoking.,false
28,Therapist,"You're describing a strong addiction, both physically and psychologically. It's like your brain is wired to associate cigarettes with relaxation and pleasure.",false
28,Client,"Yeah, that's true. And it's hard for me to imagine quitting because of how deeply ingrained the habit has become in my daily life.",false
28,Therapist,I understand. It sounds like you're facing a tough battle against an almost perfect drug – one that will do whatever you need it to do at any given time.,false
28,Client,"Oh, really? That's a good way to put it.",false
28,Therapist,"Yes, and the downside is that it can take 10 years off your life. It's like putting another nail in your coffin.",false
28,Client,"(laughs) Yeah, my aunt used to say that to me when I was younger – she'd say, ""Put another nail in your coffin"" whenever I smoked.",false
28,Therapist,"And now, as an adult, you're feeling the consequences of that habit. You feel like you've been ostracized by society because of smoking.",false
28,Client,That's true. It feels like I'm no longer the person I used to be – I'm no longer glamorous or sexy like my aunt was.,false
28,Therapist,But it's not just about how others perceive you; it's also about your own health and well-being. You need to take control of this addiction and make a change.,false
28,Client,"Mm-hmm, I know. It's time for me to take charge and quit smoking once and for all.",false
28,Therapist,That's the goal – to help you find a way to quit that works for you and your lifestyle.,false
28,Client,"Yeah, I'm ready to try again.",false
34,Therapist,"Thank you for coming in to see me today, Nina. I'm looking forward to getting to know you a little better and hearing about what brought you here today.",false
34,Client,"Um, my doctor referred me. He said I had to come because I've been a little irresponsible with this pregnancy. Yeah.",false
34,Therapist,"Okay, so your doctor is concerned that you may not have been taking good care of yourself during the pregnancy.",false
34,Client,"Yeah. Um, he said that I was drinking too much with it. Um, I-I haven't been a lot, but he said it was still maybe, um, would screw things up.",false
34,Therapist,You're worried about the potential consequences of your drinking on your baby's health.,false
34,Client,"Yeah. Yeah. Like I don't- I don't want to screw anything up with this baby, but, um, yeah, I'm just- I'm scared I already did.",false
34,Therapist,It sounds like you're feeling a lot of anxiety about what might have happened during the pregnancy.,false
34,Client,Mm-hmm. Yeah.,false
34,Therapist,And you're wondering if there's still time to make things right and give your baby the best possible start in life.,false
34,Client,"Yeah. He didn't really tell me what to expect. He just said, ""Go- go see her as well.""",false
34,Therapist,"So, when your doctor told you to come in, he was trying to encourage you to take a closer look at your behavior during the pregnancy.",false
34,Client,"Yeah. Um, I didn't find out I was pregnant until probably two-ish months in-",false
34,Client,"-and I had already been drinking then. Um, I've been really trying not to, but, you know, weekends come around, and, um, all my friends are kind of partying and stuff, and it's been hard to, like, break that habit.",false
34,Therapist,It sounds like there's a lot of pressure from your social circle to keep up with their lifestyle.,false
34,Client,"A little bit. I think if I- if I talk to them, it would be fine, but it's-it's weird, right? Like I'm the only one of my friends that's, like, taking this step and having a kid, and they don't really know how to handle that.",false
34,Therapist,You feel like you're caught between two worlds – the world you've been living in and the new life you're about to embark on as a mother.,false
34,Client,"Kind of feels like You're between two worlds. In one world, you're preparing to be a mother and bring a baby into this world, and this other world is the world that you've been in for a while where you're kind of having a good time and-",false
34,Client,"Yeah, like, I'm- I'm still, like, I'm only in my 20s, and-and for everyone else, it's like, ""Okay, it's party time,"" and now I kind of have to, like, break out of that.",false
34,Therapist,You're feeling like you need to leave the party scene behind and start a new chapter as a mother.,false
34,Client,"There's, yeah, there's part of me that still wants to live that out because I'm not going to have another chance, like once this kid comes, it's-it's going to be over. I know I'm gonna- I know I'm going to have to change.",false
34,Client,"So, for you, you're feeling like once the baby comes and actually in your arms, then things are going to change, but right now, while you're pregnant, you're thinking, ""I can kind of hang out in both worlds a little bit,"" but part of you may be thinking maybe that's not the case. It's time to go to the mom world maybe.",false
34,Client,Yeah. Probably. And I'm also feeling like it's too late. I already screwed it up.,false
34,Client,Mm-hmm. Yeah.,false
34,Client,"Well, I know, like, they say not to, but I thought because my friends didn't really care, I thought, ""Okay. Like maybe-maybe it doesn't matter. Maybe it's just what they tell you."" Just like drinking, in general, is bad.",false
34,Client,Yeah.,false
34,Client,It's telling me that what I'm doing is wrong and it's probably hurting my kid and that- that I'm gonna really regret that once I actually get my kid.,false
34,Client,"And really wanna do what's best for my babe. And kind of wondering, um, how to move forward from here, is that where you wanna, you know, kind of focus in on, or what are your thoughts about giving up drinking altogether?",false
34,Client,"Um, I'm definitely it's not-- I think I could probably do it. It's just- it-it comes hard when you're, like, in that moment. You're around your friends and they're drinking and you don't wanna be- you don't wanna be the mom at that moment. You wanna be yourself. You wanna be who you were before.",false
34,Client,"And so many people, when they have kids, they just vanish from their friends. And I don't wanna be that person. I don't wanna be that person that just has a kid and they're completely-completely different.",false
34,Client,"Mm-hmm. So, embraces this life of the picket fence and the, you know, the little house and having the baby in this-",false
34,Client,"Yeah, I-I guess. Like, I don't wanna- I don't wanna lose my friends because of this. And I don't wanna put pressure on them to change because they're, I mean, they're good people. They're just—",false
34,Client,Yeah.,false
34,Client,A little bit.,false
34,Client,I don’t want that.,false
34,Client,"Yeah, like, I should probably have trusted my gut.",false
34,Client,Yeah. Probably. And I'm also feeling like it's too late. I already screwed it up.,false
34,Client,"Mm-hmm, I have to do.",false
34,Client,"Um yeah, like I'm so close anyways, that I know I need to now. Um, and I just also, like, have I completely screwed this up, like, is it already too late?",false
34,Client,"Mm-hmm, I have to do.",false
34,Client,I don't think so. I think just knowing that it's not too late already is enough kick in the pants to get started.,false
34,Client,A little bit.,false
40,Therapist,That's great to hear. It sounds like you're feeling pretty good about where you are right now.,false
40,Client,Pretty good. It's been three months now.,false
40,Therapist,I'm glad to see that progress is being made. Can you tell me more about what's been going on since we last spoke?,false
40,Client,"Um, and—",false
40,Therapist,"Since the time you used meth for the last time, you've been doing well, right?",false
40,Client,Right.,false
40,Therapist,That's good to hear. It sounds like you're taking steps to move forward.,false
40,Client,"Right. It's been three months, and I've been doing pretty well.",false
40,Therapist,I'm glad to see that. Have you noticed any changes in your relationships with others since we last talked?,false
40,Client,"Um, and I met a couple new friends.",false
40,Therapist,That's great! It sounds like you're building some positive connections.,false
40,Client,So—,false
40,Therapist,You were cutting ties with the ex-boyfriend who was also involved with meth. Is that still happening for you?,false
40,Client,Right.,false
40,Therapist,And how is that working out for you? Are you feeling more in control of those boundaries?,false
40,Client,"Right. It's been good. I haven't answered the phone when he's called, and a couple of my other friends have tried to call me as well, and I haven't answered the phone.",false
40,Therapist,"Okay, that makes sense. It sounds like you're taking care of yourself and setting healthy boundaries.",false
40,Client,"-and a couple of my other friends have tried to call me as well, and I haven't answered the phone. Um, so it's been good for me to just reach out and like, meet a couple of new people, um, in the neighborhood that I'm living in.",false
40,Therapist,It sounds like you're making some positive changes in your environment and relationships.,false
40,Client,"Yeah, the new friends, and I've been using the breathing exercises you taught me, when I get start to feel a little stressed out, and I've been- I've been using those and it helps me.",false
40,Therapist,That's great to hear. It sounds like those breathing exercises are really helping you manage stress.,false
40,Client,"I go for a walk and do my breathing exercises, and it calms me down and kind of gets me through that time.",false
40,Therapist,So it sounds like the combination of new friendships and self-care practices is really supporting your well-being right now.,false
49,Therapist,"Welcome back, Catherine. I'm looking forward to hearing about what's been on your mind since our last session. Can you tell me what's different this time and how your thoughts have evolved regarding coming here?",false
49,Client,I suppose my expectations are clearer now about why I'm here.,false
49,Therapist,That's a good start. What made that shift possible for you?,false
49,Client,"I guess it made me think about the money I've been losing recently, and I'm happier to be here.",false
49,Therapist,It sounds like there's been a significant change in your perspective. Can you elaborate on what led to this realization?,false
49,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
49,Therapist,"Okay, so it seems like we're off to a good start. What do you think is the most pressing issue that needs attention right now?",false
49,Client,I suppose it's really serious if I want to get out of my debt.,false
49,Therapist,That's a clear priority for you. Can you tell me more about what's holding you back from taking action on this front?,false
49,Client,"Credit comes out of my ears, and mom and dad aren't bailing me out anymore, so...",false
49,Therapist,I understand that feeling of responsibility. What do you think is the first step you need to take to start addressing your debt?,false
49,Client,"Probably cutting up the credit cards for a starter, and trying to restrain myself.",false
49,Therapist,That's a great starting point. How do you plan on avoiding situations that might trigger your desire to gamble again?,false
49,Client,"You know, if the pokies are at the pubs, just don't go to the pub.",false
49,Therapist,It's not always easy to avoid those environments. What strategies have you found helpful in the past when you've felt tempted to gamble?,false
49,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
49,Therapist,"Okay, so it sounds like we need to work on building your confidence in making healthier choices. Can you tell me more about what's holding you back from feeling confident in this area?",false
49,Client,I think it's just that my lifestyle is really different from where I want to be.,false
49,Therapist,That can make it feel overwhelming. What do you think would need to change for you to start feeling more confident in your ability to make progress towards your goals?,false
49,Client,"I suppose I'd have to cut off some of my friendships, because they're part of that lifestyle.",false
49,Therapist,That's a significant decision. What do you think would be the most challenging part of making those changes?,false
49,Client,I believe then to cut off some of my friendships.,false
49,Therapist,"Okay, so it sounds like having supportive friends could be a key factor in your success. Can you tell me more about what you're looking for in terms of support from your friends right now?",false
49,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
49,Therapist,"Alright, so we've identified some potential challenges and opportunities for growth. What's one thing you can do between now and our next session to start moving forward?",false
49,Client,Find the scissors.,false
49,Therapist,Cutting up those credit cards is a great first step. Let's also look into getting in touch with a budget advice service to help you get back on track financially.,false
49,Client,"Mm-hmm, that will be good.",false
49,Therapist,"Okay, I'll make some calls and we can set something up for you.",false
43,Therapist,"Thank you for sharing this with me, Tanya. I'd like to explore something that might be helpful in our conversation – what's one aspect of yourself or your life where you feel uncertain and would like to make a change?",false
43,Client,"Well, I have anxiety, and there's this test coming up. It's big, and I've been putting it off because I'm anxious about not doing well.",false
43,Therapist,"This anxiety is holding you back from taking the test, and it sounds like you're struggling with self-doubt about your ability to succeed.",false
43,Client,Yeah.,false
43,Therapist,"So, it's easier for you to avoid dealing with this anxiety rather than facing it head-on.",false
43,Client,Exactly. I just put it off.,false
43,Therapist,"On a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 is not confident at all and 10 is very confident, how confident do you feel about managing your anxiety when taking this exam?",false
43,Client,Maybe a four or five.,false
43,Therapist,That's a small step up from before. What makes you think that this time around will be different?,false
43,Client,"I've made the appointment, and I've already rescheduled it once before. This time feels slightly more manageable.",false
43,Therapist,"You've taken steps to prepare for this exam by making the appointment and rescheduling it, which suggests you're taking action despite your anxiety.",false
43,Client,Yes.,false
43,Therapist,"It seems like you're feeling a sense of relief that the test is finally coming up, but you still worry about how others might perceive you if you don't do well.",false
43,Client,Yeah. I'm worried about what people will think if I don't pass it.,false
43,Therapist,You want to avoid those feelings of anxiety and embarrassment.,false
43,Client,Right.,false
43,Therapist,Can you think of a time in the past when you faced a challenging situation and successfully overcame your anxiety?,false
43,Client,"Maybe four or five years ago, I had to record something for work. I was really anxious about it, but I ended up doing well, and it felt great.",false
43,Therapist,That experience must have built your confidence and helped you see yourself in a more positive light.,false
43,Client,"Yeah, it did make me feel good.",false
43,Therapist,"It sounds like that experience has given you hope for success in the future, especially if you can tap into that same feeling of pride and accomplishment.",false
43,Client,I think so.,false
43,Therapist,"So, to move forward, what would need to happen for you to feel more confident – a certain level of preparation or a specific mindset shift?",false
43,Client,"Well, just practicing and seeing how I do might help me feel more confident. And maybe having faith in myself that I can do it instead of thinking I'll fail.",false
43,Therapist,Positive self-talk could be a powerful tool for you right now.,false
43,Client,Yeah.,false
43,Therapist,"To summarize, it seems like you're still feeling anxious about this test, but you've made progress by taking action and recalling past successes. You seem ready to face your fears and remind yourself of your capabilities.",false
43,Client,Yeah.,false
43,Therapist,"Okay, thank you for sharing this with me, Tanya.",false
43,Client,Thank you.,false
43,Therapist,"",false
64,Therapist,"Welcome, Ricky.",false
64,Client,Thank you.,false
64,Therapist,Nice to meet you.,false
64,Client,"Yeah, you too.",false
64,Therapist,And you found us okay?,false
64,Client,"Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.",false
64,Therapist,Alright.,false
64,Client,Yeah. Yeah. pretty straightforward-,false
64,Therapist,Yeah,false
64,Client,-always good.,false
64,Therapist,Have you been here before?,false
64,Client,"No. No, not at all.",false
64,Therapist,"Mm. Okay. Alright. Well, um, I know a little about why you're here today-",false
64,Client,Yeah.,false
64,Therapist,"-um, but it's great to see you, and so maybe a good point to start with is, tell me why you're here.",false
64,Client,"Sure. Um, I guess, you know, maybe two or three weeks ago, I had sort of like this group of friends come around to my place, and um, you know, they-they were sort of saying that it was just like a night to hang out and watch DVDs and stuff, and then they sort of sat me down and were like, ""You know, maybe you need to get a bit of help for, you know, drug stuff."" Then, you know, I was sort of like, ""Well, mm."" And I was quite annoyed by that at first, but I-I suppose, you know, I thought about it for a bit and then I was like, ""Well, I guess it can't hurt to talk to someone about it, maybe.""",false
64,Therapist,Right.,false
64,Client,Yeah.,false
64,Therapist,And that's led you to being here today?,false
64,Client,Yeah.,false
64,Therapist,Alright.,false
64,Client,"Yeah. I just sort of did a bit of search on the internet and stuff and just read about this place, so I just thought I'll—",false
64,Therapist,"Right. So it sounds like you thought there was something that, uh, that you needed to look at, something that was concerning you?",false
64,Client,"Yeah, I guess. I-I suppose I hadn't really thought about it till they sat me down, and you know- I mean I could, uh, I could understand a little bit of where they were coming from, so yeah, I thought I'd—",false
64,Therapist,They were concerned for you?,false
64,Client,Yeah.,false
64,Therapist,Alright.,false
64,Client,"Yeah. Yeah, which kind of was a bit of a sh-shock, I suppose.",false
64,Therapist,You were surprised?,false
64,Client,"Yeah. Yeah, 'cause, you know, I don't know. You know, you see on movies when people sort of intervene or say, ""You know, you need to go and get help."" And then-- I don't know. Like you know those characters and, they-they do need help, you know-",false
64,Therapist,Yep.,false
64,Client,-because they're fucked.,false
64,Therapist,Mm-hmm.,false
64,Client,"And you kind of go, ""Woah. That's not me."" So it's about am I—",false
64,Therapist,You're not sure that applies to you?,false
64,Client,"Yeah, or well, not to that extent, you know what I mean? Like, I-I would-- l didn't think I was at anywhere near a point that I would need to be sat down and intervened with-",false
64,Therapist,Okay.,false
64,Client,-if you know what I mean.,false
64,Therapist,Alright.,false
64,Client,I suppose.,false
64,Therapist,"I'm trying to understand you so far, something's concerning you and something's concerning your friends-",false
64,Client,Yeah.,false
64,Therapist,-but you're not sure whether it's- whether-- just how bad it is or- and you're just wanting to check that out?,false
64,Client,"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, 'cause, I mean, you know, they are my friends and-",false
64,Therapist,Mm-hmm.,false
64,Client,"-you know, I'm not gonna be so narrow-minded as to say for sure that, you know, they're entirely wrong 'cause there's a big group of them, you know? And they do care, so obviously, there's something there that I might have overlooked. But on the other hand, I'm sort of like, ""Well, was it that bad?"" And you know, ""Was that- was that really necessary?"" But I, you know, I thought I'd give them the benefit of the doubt and-",false
64,Therapist,Yeah.,false
64,Client,"-and just check it up, yep.",false
64,Therapist,"Because they care about you and-and you respect what they say, and you're wondering whether something about what they're saying may be right, but let's check that out a bit?",false
64,Client,"Yeah, pretty right.",false
64,Therapist,Alright.,false
64,Client,Yeah.,false
64,Therapist,"Well, let's do some checking out.",false
64,Client,"Okay, cool.",false
64,Therapist,"So tell me a little bit about what you're doing, what is- what is the concern that they are raising.",false
64,Client,"Um, dr-drugs, I guess.",false
64,Therapist,Mm-hmm.,false
64,Client,"Mm, yeah. Sort of kind of do a bit of P now and again-",false
64,Therapist,Alright.,false
64,Client,"-and, um, I guess less often, I do a bit of, you know, I smoke a little bit and, um, party pills in the- in the weekend sometimes.",false
64,Therapist,Okay.,false
64,Client,Yeah.,false
64,Therapist,"Tell me a little bit about what now and again means, and-and-and how often.",false
64,Client,"Um, a couple of times a week maybe.",false
64,Therapist,"Is this- is this with, uh, with the drug?",false
64,Client,"Yeah, yeah.",false
64,Therapist,This is meth you're talking about? A couple of times a week?,false
64,Client,"Mm-hmm, yeah. Yeah. So I guess when I put it that way, it does sound quite a lot, but it doesn't feel a lot, you know? If you know what I mean?",false
64,Therapist,"Well, maybe, we c-- we can check that out to see whether-whether it's a lot or-- But maybe also importantly to-to discuss with you what the effects are and-and-and what your concerns are about it. But help me to understand a little bit more of what it's like for you. Tell me- tell me what are the things about your, uh, use of meth that you- that you've liked that you found good for you?",false
64,Client,"Right. Um, I suppose it's kind of hand-in-hand with just hanging out with, sort of, some new scene that I've-- Like, um, I moved to Auckland maybe three years ago.",false
64,Therapist,Mm-hmm.,false
64,Client,"And, um, I still live in Palmy and, so as you can imagine, it's sort of a bit different down there. And, um, kind of just when I first got here I was sorta introduced a little bit to, um, like do you know Family Bar on-on the gay scene?",false
64,Therapist,Yeah.,false
64,Client,-and most people are using something and having a good time.,false
64,Therapist,And it might be hard to be part of that scene and not to be using drugs?,false
64,Client,"Yeah. I mean there are people that do that. I suppose it-it would be hard. I-I haven't really thought about it, I suppose. That's all it is, all I've known that scene to be, you know, 'cause I'm quite new to it, you know-",false
64,Therapist,Right.,false
64,Client,-so from the beginning it was always there.,false
64,Therapist,So there is a possibility that there are other parts of the scene that don't rely on drug use-,false
64,Client,Yeah.,false
64,Therapist,-or particularly on-on meth use?,false
64,Client,"Oh yeah, well, they must be. I can't imagine everyone is there, I guess just the majority or at least p-- the majority of people that I know, yeah.",false
64,Therapist,"So that might be something that we can look at but later if you're interested in is maybe what are some of those other parts of the gay scene, whose still party and party medley, but when meth is not a- is not a dominant-",false
64,Client,Yeah.,false
64,Therapist,"-factor in that partying, and we- where-where there are, uh, uh, uh, gay groups that support people who-who are not wanting to be-- they have a lifestyle that is heavily weighted to drug use. So there are some options there to look at some other ideas if you're interested and we might look at that, for you to think about-",false
64,Client,Yeah.,false
64,Therapist,"-to consider, so it's not about giving up anything, it's not about huge major changes, it's about how can I improve the situation.",false
64,Client,Yep. Yeah.,false
64,Therapist,It's what I'm hearing you saying bring-- be a little bit more in control of what's-what's going on for me.,false
64,Client,Yep.,false
64,Therapist,So that I can pursue that plan.,false
64,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
64,Therapist,What could be a- what could be a first step towards that?,false
64,Client,"Well, [coughs] I must say I was a bit, um, you know, at the start when I was sort of saying I, you know, this is how often I do it and then I found myself talking about the kind of the weekday stuff I kinda took myself back a bit there. I suppose, you know, on a Wednesday by yourself like it doesn't sound that good.",false
64,Therapist,"So that needs some thinking about, doesn't it?",false
64,Client,Yeah.,false
64,Therapist,As to what-,false
64,Client,Yeah.,false
64,Therapist,-what would work for you-,false
64,Client,Mm.,false
64,Therapist,-as an alternative.,false
64,Client,"Yeah. Yeah, but I think you're right about, just something to look forward to, because it's that midweek slump, you know. So far away till people will be in their place where they can-",false
64,Therapist,Yeah.,false
64,Client,-hang out and have a good time.,false
64,Therapist,"Yeah. Yeah. And there are things that have gotta work for you, so that-",false
64,Client,Yeah.,false
64,Therapist,"-that's your ideas on there which are really important. But again there are some options, that if you wanted to look at, you know, just to at least be able to know what they are.",false
64,Client,Yeah.,false
64,Therapist,Because there are clubs and there are groups and there are all kinds of things that meet through the week.,false
64,Client,Yeah.,false
64,Therapist,"And so, though they're not going to be necessarily like the party scene, they are other activities. Now I'm talking about gay groups and gay activities which are an option that-",false
64,Client,Yeah.,false
64,Therapist,"-you know, good to know about and-and-and maybe in-- within those options or something you might say, ""Oh yeah, I'd give that a go. Have a look.""",false
64,Client,Yeah. Yep.,false
76,Therapist,"Hi, Deborah. How are you feeling today?",false
76,Client,"I'm doing really well, thanks for asking.",false
76,Therapist,"So, you completed your Values Clarification Sheet. Is there anything specific that surprised you or stood out to you?",false
76,Client,"Yeah, I really enjoy this process, and I like how health is my top value because it encompasses physical and mental well-being, as well as spiritual and emotional balance for me.",false
76,Therapist,"That's interesting. So, health being your number one value is pushing you into a new direction in your career.",false
76,Client,"Yes, I'm excited to pursue a certification in fitness training after feeling unfulfilled in my office job. Being active and healthy is important to me.",false
76,Therapist,Have you done this Values Clarification Sheet more than once?,false
76,Client,"Yes, I have. And health has consistently been one of my top values.",false
76,Therapist,What's changed since the last time you did it? Is there something specific that led you to place inner harmony at number two?,false
76,Client,"Actually, I've been practicing yoga and learning how to teach it, which has helped me cultivate a greater sense of inner peace and self-awareness. It's also made me realize the importance of prioritizing my own needs.",false
76,Therapist,"That makes sense. So, you feel like you can help others while still taking care of yourself?",false
76,Client,"Yes, I believe that's possible. I've always tried to put others first, but now I see that it's okay to prioritize myself too. It's not selfish; it's necessary for my own well-being.",false
76,Therapist,And what about wisdom? You mentioned it was on your list before.,false
76,Client,"Yes, wisdom is high on my list because I value learning and experiencing different cultures. Being open to new things and perspectives has brought me a lot of joy and wisdom.",false
76,Therapist,"So, you're saying that living with inner peace allows you to navigate life's challenges more easily?",false
76,Client,Exactly. I feel like I can handle whatever comes my way as long as I have that inner peace within myself.,false
76,Therapist,And what about pleasure? You mentioned it was on your list too.,false
76,Client,"Yes, pleasure is important to me because it brings me joy and fulfillment. I enjoy learning new things and experiencing different cultures, which helps me stay grounded and at peace.",false
76,Therapist,It sounds like your values are interconnected. Can you tell me more about how that works for you?,false
76,Client,"For me, it's all about finding balance and prioritizing my own needs while still being able to help others. I've come to realize that true joy comes from accepting the ups and downs of life.",false
76,Therapist,That's a beautiful perspective. It sounds like your values are guiding you towards a more authentic and fulfilling life.,false
76,Client,"Yes, I feel like this process has helped me clarify my priorities and live more in alignment with who I am.",false
76,Therapist,"Well, it was nice talking to you, Deborah. Thank you for sharing your insights with me.",false
76,Client,The same to you. It was helpful to talk through these things with someone who listens and encourages me.,false
70,Therapist,"Hi, Dr. Martin. I'm Lori, the pharmacist on duty today. Can you spare a minute to discuss your questions about citalopram?",false
70,Client,"Yeah, just a couple of minutes, though.",false
70,Therapist,"Okay, let's get started then. What specifically are you looking for regarding this medication?",false
70,Client,"Honestly, I'm not familiar with it at all.",false
70,Therapist,"Citalopram is an SSRI used primarily to treat depression. It comes in 10, 20, and 40 milligram tablets, and patients typically see improvement within four to eight weeks. Are there any specific concerns you have about this medication?",false
70,Client,Okay... what are some potential side effects?,false
70,Therapist,"Common side effects include gastrointestinal issues, sedation, or sexual dysfunction. If these occur, we can explore adjusting the dose or switching to a different medication.",false
70,Client,What about interactions with phenelzine? I'm not sure if it's safe to take them together.,false
70,Therapist,I'll need to look into that for you and get back to you later today with more information.,false
70,Client,"That's okay, thanks.",false
70,Therapist,"You're welcome. Thank you for your time, Dr. Martin.",false
70,Client,Thank you.,false
73,Therapist,"So with his encouragement, you decided to try some substances.",false
73,Client,Oxy.,false
73,Therapist,You tried oxy? Okay. And he encouraged you to do that.,false
73,Client,Yeah. He said it was a pain medicine.,false
73,Therapist,He said that would help you with some of the pain you've been experiencing.,false
73,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
73,Therapist,"So, you trusted him on that and found it helpful in certain ways, especially when dealing with your grandma's loss.",false
73,Client,Dealing with my grandma's loss.,false
73,Therapist,That's helped you feel a bit better. But I sense there's still some pain and sadness you're struggling with.,false
73,Client,"Yeah. I feel alone, and I just miss her.",false
73,Therapist,"It sounds like the oxy has been a temporary comfort for you, but it's not something you want to rely on long-term.",false
73,Client,"Mm-hmm. Yeah, and—",false
73,Therapist,You're concerned about becoming dependent on it or losing control over your use of it.,false
73,Client,Right.,false
73,Therapist,"It sounds like there's a lot going on in your life right now, and managing all these emotions can be overwhelming.",false
73,Client,"Yeah, it is.",false
73,Therapist,I appreciate you being honest with me about feeling uncertain about the oxy. You're doing the best you can to cope.,false
73,Client,"Yeah, well, I don't really know too much about it, other than it makes me feel good.",false
73,Therapist,"For now, it's clear that the oxy provides some relief and comfort for you.",false
88,Therapist,"So, for you, what specific goals would you like to focus on improving over the next 30 days?",false
88,Client,I have to start getting to school on time for my first hour. I always miss that class.,false
88,Therapist,Is getting to your first hour a goal that's important to you right now?,false
88,Client,Yes.,false
88,Therapist,What motivates you to make this goal a priority?,false
88,Client,"Uh, so people will get off my back.",false
88,Therapist,Who are these people that you're trying to avoid disappointing?,false
88,Client,"My mom she's always saying, you know, get to school. My PO will be like, you know, if you don't get the school on time, I can bring you back in for sanctions and I don't want to go back in.",false
88,Therapist,So avoiding sanctions is a big part of your motivation?,false
88,Client,Yes.,false
88,Therapist,"Okay, so getting to school for your first hour is something that will help you avoid those consequences. Is that right?",false
88,Client,Yes.,false
88,Therapist,What specific steps do you think would help you get to school on time?,false
88,Client,"I can't ever get up in the morning. So that's hard and then by the time I do get up, and then I get ready and get dressed, I miss the bus. So then I usually end up walking or see if I can find a ride.",false
88,Therapist,It sounds like there are several factors that might be contributing to your tardiness. Is it just one thing in particular?,false
88,Client,No.,false
88,Therapist,"Okay, so knowing that multiple things could get in the way, what do you think would work best for you to get to school on time? What's something you know you need to do differently?",false
88,Client,Get up on time would probably be a good start of making me get there on time.,false
88,Therapist,"If getting up on time is key, what time would that need to be?",false
88,Client,"[sighs] If I'm gonna catch the bus I'll probably need to be up by 6:15 and sometimes that's just so hard to do, 'cause I go to bed so late and I don't know if I can do it.",false
88,Therapist,So you're still feeling uncertain about whether this is something you can commit to. But you want to try because of the potential consequences?,false
88,Client,Right. I could try-,false
88,Therapist,"Okay, so you're willing to at least attempt to get your life back on track.",false
88,Client,Yes.,false
88,Therapist,"If getting up by 6:15 is the goal, what time would that need to be for you to go to bed at night?",false
88,Client,"I go about midnight now, so if I tried maybe 11:00. I can try 11:00.",false
88,Therapist,So going to bed by 11:00 would be a good starting point. What's the plan for getting up on time tomorrow or the next day?,false
88,Client,"Uh, either tomorrow or the next day.",false
88,Therapist,Which one sounds more realistic to you right now?,false
88,Client,Let's start tomorrow.,false
88,Therapist,Tomorrow it is. Who do you think would be able to support you in making this goal a reality?,false
88,Client,My mom.,false
88,Therapist,Your mom will be there to help remind you and encourage you when you need it.,false
88,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
88,Therapist,Is there anything your mom could do specifically to help you get up on time and make sure you're ready for school by 6:15?,false
88,Client,"[sighs] She can after my alarm goes off, if I don't get up, she could come in and wake me up and remind me that I said to you that I'm going to get up so that I have to do it.",false
88,Therapist,"So your mom's role is not just about reminding you, but also about holding you accountable for making this goal a priority. Is that right?",false
88,Client,Exactly. Yup.,false
88,Therapist,Great. What are some potential obstacles that might get in the way of you getting up on time and being ready for school by 6:15?,false
88,Client,[sighs] Not going to bed on time.,false
88,Therapist,Not going to bed on time is a big part of this challenge. How do you think you could overcome that obstacle?,false
88,Client,"Just go to bed and turn off the lights, don't have my phone.",false
88,Therapist,Keeping your phone away and making sure it's dark can help signal to you that it's time for sleep. Is there anyone else who could support you in this effort?,false
88,Client,Have my mom check on me to make sure everything's put away.,false
88,Therapist,And having your mom check in with you can also provide an added layer of accountability and support. How will you know if your plan is working?,false
88,Client,"When I'm at school on time, when the bell rings and I'm in class.",false
88,Therapist,"So for you, getting to school on time means being successful and avoiding those consequences. You've already identified some steps that could help you get there. What's one thing that you're most looking forward to about making this goal a priority?",false
88,Client,Absolutely.,false
88,Therapist,It sounds like you're feeling hopeful and motivated about taking control of your schedule and getting back on track. Is that right?,false
88,Client,"Well, yeah, I hope so.",false
88,Therapist,"Great plan, and you said you're going to start tomorrow. What do you think will be the most important part of making this goal a success?",false
88,Client,I'll give it a try.,false
88,Therapist,Great. Thank you for being open and honest with me about your goals and challenges.,false
88,Client,You're welcome.,false
79,Therapist,Can you tell me more about what happened when you realized you'd messed up?,false
79,Client,"I was right there, man. I was in the same place where I always come home and take those pills, and I just wanted to stay there.",false
79,Therapist,It sounds like being in that familiar environment made it hard for you to leave. What did you think you had ruined by staying there?,false
79,Client,"Everything. Erin called me the next day, and he was great, but I felt ashamed of myself, and I don't want to feel that way again.",false
79,Therapist,It seems like you're worried about putting something or someone important at risk. Is that what's been causing your guilt?,false
79,Client,"Yeah, I guess that's what I mean. Because if I'd just stayed hammered every night, I could have kept doing it for the rest of the week.",false
79,Therapist,"So, you saw yourself taking a risk with something valuable to you.",false
79,Client,But I don't know if I stopped because I knew I had to or because I was drawn back to that place. It's hard to say now.,false
79,Therapist,"Three months have passed since then, and things seem to be going well again. You even get to spend time with your kids, which is something you've been working towards.",false
79,Client,"Yeah, they're better.",false
79,Therapist,"And then there was a moment where it felt like progress had stalled – maybe not stopped entirely, but shifted from red to cautionary. What did that feel like for you?",false
79,Client,Yeah.,false
82,Therapist,Would you be willing to explore your thoughts and feelings about alcohol and contraception through a self-evaluation?,false
82,Client,Sure.,false
82,Therapist,"Okay. Let's use a 10-point scale, where 1 is not important at all and 10 is very important. On this scale, how would you rate the importance of drinking within risk limits for you?",false
82,Client,I'd say an eight.,false
82,Therapist,An eight. Can you help me understand what that number means to you in terms of your priorities?,false
82,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
82,Therapist,"Okay. And on a 10-point scale, how confident are you right now about being able to drink below risk levels?",false
82,Client,I'd say a four.,false
82,Therapist,A four. What's driving that level of confidence for you?,false
82,Client,"I think it's because you've told me I'm at risk and I have alcoholism in my family – I really don't want to go down that path. So, I'm confident that I can change this at this point.",false
82,Therapist,That gives you a strong reason not to drink. Is there anything else that helps you feel more confident about making healthy choices?,false
82,Client,"Yeah, I have friends who don't drink and we hang out together – it's not an issue for me when I'm with them.",false
82,Therapist,"So, having a support system that allows you to enjoy social activities without drinking is helpful. Is there anything else you'd like to share about your feelings on this topic?",false
82,Client,Nope.,false
82,Therapist,"Now, let's move on to birth control. On a 10-point scale, how important is it for you to use effective birth control every time you have sex to prevent pregnancy?",false
82,Client,I'd say an eight.,false
82,Therapist,"An eight. And on a 10-point scale, how confident are you right now about using effective birth control?",false
82,Client,Probably a six.,false
82,Therapist,You're fairly confident in your ability to use it correctly. What's driving that level of confidence for you?,false
82,Client,"I think if I drink less, I'll be more reliable with using birth control. When I do drink, I tend to not use it as much.",false
82,Therapist,"So, there is a link between your drinking habits and your ability to use birth control effectively. Is that correct?",false
82,Client,Yeah.,false
82,Therapist,It seems like you're recognizing the importance of managing your drinking to also manage your birth control. Would you like to develop a plan for reducing your alcohol use today?,false
82,Client,Before I leave?,false
82,Therapist,"Yes, before you leave.",false
82,Client,Okay.,false
82,Therapist,"And if you need any additional information or support, we can provide that for you.",false
82,Client,Okay.,false
82,Therapist,"",false
97,Therapist,"Let's get your medication sorted out, shall we?",false
97,Client,Good.,false
97,Therapist,I see that your blood pressure is a bit higher than expected.,false
97,Client,Yeah.,false
97,Therapist,Perhaps we could discuss your weight as well?,false
97,Client,What?,false
97,Therapist,I'd like to explore the possibility of talking about your weight with you for just a couple of minutes.,false
97,Client,"You are joking, aren't you? I mean, look, I've made time in my day to come here.",false
97,Therapist,"I understand that you value your time, and I apologize if it feels like an imposition.",false
97,Client,I'm kept in your waiting room-,false
97,Therapist,I can imagine how frustrating that must be for you.,false
97,Client,-for 45 minutes.,false
97,Therapist,"That's a long wait, and I appreciate your patience.",false
97,Client,It's not acceptable.,false
97,Therapist,I understand why you'd feel that way.,false
97,Client,You know?,false
97,Therapist,"Yes, I do.",false
97,Client,If I make an appointment with a client for 10:00-,false
97,Therapist,"That's a reasonable expectation, and I apologize if we haven't met it yet.",false
97,Client,"-I expect them to start at 10:00, not 10:45.",false
97,Therapist,"Right, and you're busy enough, and—",false
97,Client,"Yeah, I've got other things to do. I've got accounts to do.",false
97,Therapist,You have a lot on your plate.,false
97,Client,I've got clients they're coming in.,false
97,Therapist,And you're managing their schedules as well.,false
97,Client,You know?,false
97,Therapist,"Yes, I'm aware of the challenges you face.",false
97,Client,You know?,false
97,Therapist,Exactly.,false
97,Client,If I make an appointment with a client for 10:00-,false
97,Therapist,"That's a good time frame, and I'll do my best to keep it.",false
97,Client,-I don't expect to be kept waiting for half an hour-,false
97,Therapist,"Not at all, and I appreciate your understanding.",false
97,Client,"-or whatever, 'cause it's—",false
97,Therapist,We can work together to find a solution that suits you.,false
97,Client,That'd be good.,false
97,Therapist,"Let me suggest an alternative. If you come in for the first appointment, we can schedule the next one at 8:30,",false
97,Client,That'd be good.,false
97,Therapist,"And during that visit, we'll explore ways to help you fit a healthier lifestyle into your busy schedule.",false
97,Client,"I'll maybe have a look at my schedule, see whether anything-",false
97,Therapist,We can work together to find a time slot that works for you.,false
97,Client,"-can be arranged, or I can pass something on-",false
97,Therapist,And we can make sure the next appointment is scheduled accordingly.,false
97,Client,-to something on to some—,false
97,Therapist,"So it's not wasted time, and we can have a productive conversation.",false
97,Client,"Yeah, of course.",false
97,Therapist,Good. Let's summarize what you've shared so far.,false
97,Client,Yeah.,false
97,Therapist,"You lead a busy life as an accountant, with many responsibilities.",false
97,Client,Yeah.,false
97,Therapist,"And you're aware of the links between your health and weight, which is concerning to you.",false
97,Client,Yeah.,false
97,Therapist,"Ideally, you'd like to make changes, but it's challenging due to your lifestyle.",false
97,Client,"Yeah, I mean, I, to a certain extent, because of my lifestyle, food is just fuel.",false
97,Therapist,You see food as a necessity rather than a pleasure.,false
97,Client,"You know? Um, because I'm juggling all these balls, and I don't want to drop any.",false
97,Therapist,It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed by your responsibilities.,false
97,Client,No.,false
97,Therapist,Okay. Can we schedule another appointment in two weeks' time to discuss this further?,false
97,Client,"Um, okay, I'm up for that, but it's gonna be the same problem of, A, finding time-",false
97,Therapist,We'll work together to find a solution that suits you.,false
97,Client,"-and B, if I can make an appointment-",false
97,Therapist,And we'll ensure there's no waiting involved.,false
97,Client,-I don't expect to be kept waiting for half an hour-,false
97,Therapist,"Not at all, and I appreciate your understanding.",false
97,Client,That'd be good.,false
97,Therapist,Let's focus on finding a way to make this work for you.,false
100,Therapist,Can you tell me what brings you here today?,false
100,Client,"I'm having trouble dealing with my criminal history and trying to stay on the right path, but it's overwhelming.",false
100,Therapist,It sounds like your past is causing a lot of stress for you.,false
100,Client,"Yeah, I really want to be a good productive member of society, but I have this background that nobody will overlook.",false
100,Therapist,That must make it feel like you're stuck in a difficult situation.,false
100,Client,Exactly. And it's frustrating because I'm not given any other choice; I just don't wanna fall back into old habits.,false
100,Therapist,It's like you're feeling trapped by your past mistakes.,false
100,Client,"Yeah, that's exactly what it feels like.",false
100,Therapist,Can you tell me more about what's specifically concerning you about your criminal record?,false
100,Client,I'm not sure; it just seems to be a big obstacle for me.,false
100,Therapist,Is there anything in particular that's making you feel this way?,false
100,Client,"It's just that I had a felony conviction, and now I'm trying to get back into the workforce.",false
100,Therapist,That can be a significant challenge. Have you thought about how your record might affect job opportunities?,false
100,Client,"Yeah, it's like they're not even considering me for jobs because of it.",false
100,Therapist,"Do you think that's fair, or do you feel like there are other factors at play?",false
100,Client,I don't know; it just feels like I'm being held back by something outside of my control.,false
100,Therapist,It sounds like you're feeling a bit helpless in this situation.,false
100,Client,"Yeah, that's exactly how it feels.",false
100,Therapist,Have you considered talking to someone about your concerns and seeing if there are any resources available to help?,false
100,Client,"I have looked into advocacy groups and expungement options, but it seems like they might not be as effective as I thought.",false
100,Therapist,"It can be discouraging when we don't find the answers we're looking for. But sometimes, it's just a matter of finding the right support system.",false
100,Client,"Yeah, that makes sense. Maybe I just need to focus on what I can control and take things one step at a time.",false
100,Therapist,"That's a great approach. And remember, you're not alone in this struggle. Many people face similar challenges.",false
100,Client,Thanks for listening; it means a lot to me.,false
100,Therapist,Of course. I'm here to support you. Have you thought about starting your own business or finding work that aligns with your skills and interests?,false
100,Client,"Actually, I've been thinking about that a lot lately. Maybe I can find a way to turn my passion into a career.",false
100,Therapist,"That's a great idea. Starting your own business can be a liberating experience, especially when it comes to finding work that truly fulfills you.",false
100,Client,"Yeah, I think that might be the way forward for me.",false
100,Therapist,I'd like to help you explore some strategies for approaching job interviews and talking about your past in a way that feels comfortable for you.,false
100,Client,That would be really helpful. I just want to make sure I'm presenting myself in the best possible light.,false
100,Therapist,We can work on that together. And I also have some information about advocacy groups like the John Howard Society that might be of interest to you.,false
100,Client,"Yeah, I've heard of them. They seem like a great resource for people facing similar challenges.",false
100,Therapist,Absolutely. I'd be happy to look into it further and see if we can find any additional support or resources for you.,false
100,Client,Thanks; that would be really appreciated.,false
100,Therapist,You're welcome. It was good talking with you today. Let's schedule a follow-up appointment to check in on your progress.,false
100,Client,Sounds great. I'll make sure to come back and let you know how things are going.,false
91,Therapist,"Hi, Jean. It's a pleasure to meet you.",false
91,Client,"Good morning, doctor.",false
91,Therapist,How can I support you today?,false
91,Client,"Well, doctor, I-I made an appointment with you finally, because I was diagnosed over three months ago with COPD.",false
91,Therapist,That must be concerning for you.,false
91,Client,And although I didn't call right away. I really need some help in quitting smoking.,false
91,Therapist,Quitting can be a challenging process.,false
91,Client,"So I thought, well, this is my first step. So, uh, it's time to do something.",false
91,Therapist,It sounds like you're taking the first step towards making a change.,false
91,Client,"So I thought, well, this is my first step. So, uh, it's time to do something.",false
91,Therapist,"You've been diagnosed with COPD, and now you're looking for ways to quit smoking.",false
91,Client,And although I didn't call right away. I really need some help in quitting smoking.,false
91,Therapist,That's understandable given your diagnosis.,false
91,Client,"So I thought, well, this is my first step. So, uh, it's time to do something.",false
91,Therapist,You've been feeling scared and worried about your health since the diagnosis.,false
91,Client,"I'm- I'm really scared, 'cause I don't feel well.",false
91,Therapist,It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed by this new information.,false
91,Client,I haven't felt well for a while. I'm getting coughing fits even when I'm on the telephone with customers.,false
91,Therapist,That must be very frustrating and concerning for you.,false
91,Client,"I'm- I'm really scared, 'cause I don't feel well.",false
91,Therapist,It's understandable that you're feeling this way given your diagnosis and symptoms.,false
91,Client,I haven't felt well for a while. I'm getting coughing fits even when I'm on the telephone with customers.,false
91,Therapist,"You've been smoking for a long time, and now this diagnosis is causing you to feel afraid and frightened.",false
91,Client,Mm-hmm. I-I don't know what I'm going to do about it.,false
91,Therapist,"Quitting can be a difficult process, but you're taking the first step by acknowledging your desire to quit.",false
91,Client,"Okay, okay. Now, have you thought about when you wanted to quit by?",false
91,Therapist,You've set a goal for yourself to quit smoking in six months.,false
91,Client,"I'm giving myself six months, six months and-and, uh, that seems like a long time away, but I have a feeling I'm going to fail at this point in time. I don't even have 50%, uh, faith in myself.",false
91,Therapist,It's natural to feel uncertain about your ability to quit smoking.,false
91,Client,"Okay. So what I'm hearing you say is that, although you want to quit smoking in the next six months, you're feeling a bit, um, under-confident that you'll actually be able to do this and you're-you're worried about failing.",false
91,Therapist,"You've tried quitting before, but it hasn't been successful.",false
91,Client,"I don't know what to do. I've tried to quit smoking. I've had, uh, I've taken pills, I've taken the patch.",false
91,Therapist,It can be helpful to acknowledge your past attempts and learn from them.,false
91,Client,"I've gone through therapy. Uh, nothing's helped. I finally- I went to the doctor. I was actually in the hospital. They took me to the hospital for a week. That's the longest I quit.",false
91,Therapist,"You did manage to quit smoking during your hospital stay, but it wasn't sustainable.",false
91,Client,"I had no choice, I had no choice. And then the next day I was back to smoking again what I smoked.",false
91,Therapist,It sounds like you're struggling with feelings of helplessness and lack of control around smoking.,false
91,Client,"I thought, well, this is my first step. So, uh, it's time to do something.",false
91,Therapist,"You've been smoking for a long time, and it's become an integral part of your life.",false
91,Client,"Uh, it's part of my life. It's, uh, I started smoking when I was 13, 14 at home. My parents smoked. All of their friends smoked. It was on television. Everybody looked so grand.",false
91,Therapist,Smoking has become a way for you to cope with stress and feel more confident.,false
91,Client,"Uh, smoking and all dressed up and-and fancy clothes and maybe having a drink in their hands and having a nice meal, um, I didn't really think about it. It's just an extension of me, I guess.",false
91,Therapist,You associate smoking with feelings of sophistication and relaxation.,false
91,Client,"I mean, I feel like it is. I know when I've got that package in my pocket, or I know if there- if I'm going through some stress, I say, ""Oh, well, I'll have a cigarette and think this out.""",false
91,Therapist,Smoking has become a way for you to manage your emotions and feel more in control.,false
91,Client,That's right.,false
91,Therapist,Is there anything else that might be contributing to your desire to quit smoking?,false
91,Client,"Um, I enjoy it. It just- it relaxes me. It's great after a meal, um, for me-",false
91,Therapist,You find smoking to be a way to unwind and feel more at ease.,false
91,Client,"-we all just do it as a little group of people, uh, my family.",false
91,Therapist,"Smoking has become a social activity for you, something you do with friends and family.",false
91,Client,"The people I work with, we go out in the courtyard-",false
91,Therapist,You've found that smoking is a way to connect with others and feel more part of a group.,false
91,Client,"-have a cigarette and talk. That's how you make friends. A lot of people, um, we're like a little group now, we're all- a little bunch of us.",false
91,Therapist,You've found that smoking is a way to fit in and be accepted by others.,false
91,Client,So it's hard for me to quit smoking when everybody else around me is smoking. And it's so easy to go out and take a break and have a cigarette.,false
91,Therapist,You feel like you'll lose your social connections if you quit smoking.,false
91,Client,"I-I never thought of it that way, but probably you're right.",false
91,Therapist,Is there anything else that might be not good about smoking for you?,false
91,Client,"Well, it's bad for my health and it's scaring me 'cause I don't feel well.",false
91,Therapist,You're concerned about the impact of smoking on your physical health.,false
91,Client,I haven't felt well for a while. I'm getting coughing fits even when I'm on the telephone with customers.,false
91,Therapist,Smoking is causing you to experience symptoms and worry about your health.,false
91,Client,Is there anything else that's not good about smoking for you?,false
91,Therapist,"You're concerned about the financial burden of smoking, as well as its impact on your appearance.",false
91,Client,Yes.,false
91,Therapist,So quitting would be a significant improvement in many areas of your life.,false
91,Client,"It's for me, for my health, and for the money and everything I've said, I would say it's 10 or- out of 10 that I should quit smoking.",false
91,Therapist,"Quitting is essential to you, given all the reasons why.",false
91,Client,"Yes. A hundred percent, one of the most important things.",false
91,Therapist,How confident do you feel that you can quit smoking?,false
91,Client,"Um, I, I'd say 35 or 40% competent.",false
91,Therapist,You're feeling somewhat uncertain about your ability to quit smoking.,false
91,Client,"Yeah. I'd like to say more, but, um-",false
91,Therapist,It's clear that you've been struggling with feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt.,false
91,Client,"Well, I'm- I guess I'm still a fighter, and I-I-I- it's starting to- I'm starting to realize it and I do feel pretty good that I came to see you.",false
91,Therapist,You're feeling more confident about taking this step towards quitting smoking.,false
91,Client,"So I guess, yes. Um, it wouldn't have been as high maybe last week.",false
91,Therapist,How would you rate your confidence level in quitting smoking?,false
91,Client,"Maybe if I could come to see you again, or maybe some ideas were suggested, maybe if there was a group or something. I-I don't know, but I-I need some help.",false
91,Therapist,You feel like having support and guidance would increase your confidence in quitting.,false
91,Client,I-I think so because I feel a little better that I just came to see you today.,false
91,Therapist,Discussing this with me has helped you feel more at ease.,false
91,Client,Discussing things helps me. I always feel better when I get things out.,false
91,Therapist,It sounds like talking through your feelings and concerns is helpful for you.,false
91,Client,"So Jean, I really want to congratulate you on taking this very important first step towards addressing this problem that you've had for such a long time.",false
91,Therapist,You're acknowledging the importance of quitting smoking and taking action towards it.,false
91,Client,"But as the first small step, I wonder whether you'd be open to actually just monitoring your smoking for the next week.",false
91,Therapist,You're considering the idea of tracking your smoking habits as a way to build confidence in quitting.,false
91,Client,"In other words, think about it more, don't- don't just do it automatically.",false
91,Therapist,Writing down your thoughts and feelings can help you become more mindful of your actions.,false
91,Client,"Yeah, yeah. I think so because, um, when I get the urge, I could maybe fight it and, um, maybe wait till the next urge-",false
91,Therapist,You're thinking that taking a moment to reflect on your urges might help you make better choices.,false
91,Client,"-and maybe mark that down that, uh, I didn't go right away when something went wrong. Um, yes, I-I can try that.",false
91,Therapist,You're willing to try this approach as a way to build confidence in quitting smoking.,false
91,Client,"Okay. And I can give you a little card that can help you keep track of it. And if you can bring that back to the next appointment, it could be something we could discuss.",false
94,Therapist,"So, we're here today to explore whatever's been on your mind and see if we can gain some clarity together.",false
94,Client,How about we start with the issue of getting someone motivated to move out of my house?,false
94,Therapist,That sounds like a challenging situation. Can you tell me more about what's been going on and how you've been feeling about it?,false
94,Client,"I offered my home to someone in need, but now I'm struggling to be assertive and say it's time for them to move out.",false
94,Therapist,"It takes courage to open your home to someone in need. You're acknowledging that you want to help, but also feeling uncertain about how to set boundaries.",false
94,Client,"Yeah, I want change, but I'm not confident in expressing my needs. I feel weak in this area.",false
94,Therapist,That's understandable. Can you think of what would help you feel more confident and assertive in having them move out?,false
94,Client,"Honestly, I don't know. I care about the person, and there's comfort in having someone around, but at the same time, I'm torn between my desire for change and my attachment to having them here.",false
94,Therapist,It sounds like you're feeling a mix of emotions – a sense of responsibility to help others versus your own need for personal space and boundaries.,false
94,Client,"Exactly. I feel like I'm caught in this internal conflict, and it's hard to decide what to do.",false
94,Therapist,"You're recognizing that you want to do the right thing because you value helping others, but also feeling uncertain about how to navigate this situation.",false
94,Client,"Yeah, I appreciate your understanding. I feel like I am a good person who wants to help people out.",false
94,Therapist,"That's a valuable perspective. But sometimes, doing what's best for ourselves means taking care of our own needs and boundaries.",false
94,Client,"You're right. My job is done, and now it's time for me to be more assertive and confident in my decision-making.",false
94,Therapist,"So, what steps have you taken so far to start having this conversation with the person?",false
94,Client,"I've had some difficult conversations, but I've also tried to be logical about it. Recently, I've been more direct and clear about my expectations.",false
94,Therapist,That takes courage. Have you talked to other people who can offer support or guidance on how to navigate this situation?,false
94,Client,"Yes, that's been helpful. Discussing options with them has given me a sense of relief and made it easier to have the conversation with the person.",false
94,Therapist,It sounds like having those conversations has helped you feel more prepared and confident in your approach.,false
94,Client,"Yeah, it has. I'm feeling more at ease about setting boundaries and having him move out within a couple of days.",false
94,Therapist,That's a great goal to have. And what's driving this sense of urgency – is there something specific that's changed or a new development that's making you feel ready for this change?,false
94,Client,"To be honest, I've got some future plans and uncertainties about where I'll be living next, which has made me realize it's time for him to move out.",false
94,Therapist,"It can be scary to navigate uncertainty, but sometimes it's necessary for growth and change. Are you feeling a sense of excitement or trepidation about this upcoming change?",false
94,Client,"Oh, God, yeah – I'm scared, but also relieved that I've finally acknowledged my needs and am taking steps to address them.",false
94,Therapist,It takes courage to acknowledge our fears and take action towards change. You're doing the right thing by prioritizing your own needs and boundaries.,false
94,Client,"Thank you for understanding me. I feel like I'm being true to myself, and that's a good feeling.",false
94,Therapist,That's wonderful. And it sounds like you've got a plan in place – what are your next steps going to be?,false
94,Client,"Well, I'll talk to him about my plans, and hopefully, he'll understand where I'm coming from.",false
94,Therapist,Okay. It sounds like you're feeling more confident and prepared for this conversation.,false
112,Therapist,"I wanted to touch base with you, Chris. As your Athletic Director and someone who values you as a team player, I'm concerned about the recent partying and alcohol use that's been going on. Can you help me understand what's been driving this behavior?",false
112,Client,"Honestly, I've been feeling really suffocated by my social life and parents' expectations. I wanted to confide in someone about how I've been struggling lately.",false
112,Therapist,I see. It sounds like you're feeling a bit trapped and seeking freedom through partying.,false
112,Client,"Exactly. When my friends invited me to a party, they used my academic responsibilities against me, and I convinced my parents that I'd spend the night at a friend's house. That's when I started drinking.",false
112,Therapist,And it seems like you were able to temporarily escape your responsibilities and feel more relaxed.,false
112,Client,"Yeah, it was fun in the moment, but I kept doing it because I felt like I needed to loosen up and be more social.",false
112,Therapist,"It sounds like you're noticing some negative consequences, such as decreased focus and not doing well in school. How do you think your drinking is affecting your relationships with others?",false
112,Client,"My friends who are into that scene are still there, but now I'm hanging out with a different group because they're more laid-back. However, it's also made me feel like I'm missing out on the social aspect of my old friendships.",false
112,Therapist,It seems like you're feeling torn between your desire to fit in and your need for independence.,false
112,Client,"Yeah, that's exactly it. I don't want to be stuck in a situation where I'm not being true to myself.",false
112,Therapist,"So, what do you think is the next step for you? How can you start making some changes?",false
112,Client,I feel like I should stop drinking altogether or at least limit myself to one drink per party. I don't want to compromise my relationships with my mom and friends.,false
112,Therapist,That sounds like a realistic goal. What do you think would be a good starting point for you?,false
112,Client,"To focus on getting back in the right mindset with my mom, then prioritize my studies, and if time allows, enjoy social events without drinking.",false
112,Therapist,And what's your plan if you find yourself at a party where there's alcohol? How will you handle that situation?,false
112,Client,I'd aim to have just one drink or not drink at all. I don't want to compromise my goals or relationships.,false
112,Therapist,"It sounds like you're committed to making some significant changes, Chris. What makes you think you can succeed in this?",false
112,Client,I'm pretty confident because I've been feeling really determined to make a change since I felt betrayed by my mom. I don't want to go through that again.,false
112,Therapist,"That's a strong motivation. On a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is not at all and 10 is completely, how confident are you in your ability to change?",false
112,Client,I'd say an 8 or 9 – I'm pretty sure I can make it work.,false
112,Therapist,"Okay, what do you think would be a realistic goal for you in the short-term?",false
112,Client,"To get back on track with my studies and rebuild trust with my mom. Then, if time allows, enjoy social events without drinking.",false
112,Therapist,"That sounds like a great plan. I'm glad we could have this conversation, Chris. It means a lot to me that you're taking steps towards making positive changes in your life.",false
112,Client,Thank you for listening and supporting me – it really means a lot.,false
112,Therapist,"Of course, it's part of my job. Now, I should get changed for practice.",false
115,Therapist,Can you tell me more about why you're hesitant to rinse your mouth after smoking?,false
115,Client,Okay.,false
115,Therapist,Let's take a closer look. How do you feel when we examine your teeth and gums?,false
115,Client,Yeah.,false
115,Therapist,"I notice there is some staining, which makes me concerned about the impact of smoking on your oral health.",false
115,Client,Oh.,false
115,Therapist,"It's possible that quitting smoking could alleviate some of these concerns, including dental caries and cavities.",false
115,Client,Yeah.,false
115,Therapist,Smoking can also affect healing in your mouth. Have you considered this?,false
115,Client,Okay. Sure.,false
115,Therapist,I want to assure you that my goal is to support your oral health. There are many medications available that can help reduce cravings and make quitting easier.,false
115,Client,"I did try a pill, but it didn't work for me.",false
115,Therapist,"I understand that the medication wasn't effective for you. However, research suggests that people often need multiple attempts before they quit smoking successfully.",false
115,Client,It was a waste of time and caused more side effects.,false
115,Therapist,I want to reassure you that trying different approaches is not a waste of time. Every attempt brings you closer to quitting.,false
115,Client,But it feels like everyone keeps telling me the same thing – that I'm not doing enough or that I'm a fool for smoking.,false
115,Therapist,"There are valid concerns about your health, and it's natural to feel defensive when faced with repeated advice from multiple healthcare professionals.",false
115,Client,It's just hard to quit.,false
115,Therapist,I want to emphasize the importance of quitting smoking. These medications can be a valuable tool in helping you achieve this goal.,false
115,Client,Yeah.,false
115,Therapist,"Since you've shown willingness to try medication before, I'd like to write you a prescription and discuss how we can use it to support your quit plan.",false
115,Client,I guess I need to really want to quit.,false
115,Therapist,The risks associated with smoking far outweigh any potential benefits from the medications. Let's focus on finding a solution that works for you.,false
115,Client,Okay.,false
115,Therapist,The side effects of these medications are minimal compared to the health risks posed by smoking.,false
115,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
115,Therapist,It's essential to consider the long-term consequences of your actions.,false
115,Client,"Okay. Well, can I go now?",false
115,Therapist,"Before you leave, I want to reiterate my concern for your oral health and overall well-being.",false
115,Client,I appreciate your care.,false
115,Therapist,"My commitment is to support your health, and I'm here to help you find a solution that works for you.",false
115,Client,Okay.,false
115,Therapist,Let's work together to create a plan that addresses your concerns and supports your quit journey.,false
121,Therapist,"It seems that you're starting to think about making some changes, and it's a good idea to start with small steps.",false
121,Client,"I'm thinking of cutting out sugar from my coffee, and maybe taking up squash or something like that.",false
121,Therapist,That sounds like a great plan. You'll start by reducing the amount of sugar in your coffee and then see how you feel.,false
121,Client,"Yeah, I think that's a good idea. And I might also try to get more exercise, like going to the gym or joining a squash club.",false
121,Therapist,"It's not about making huge changes, but rather finding small ways to improve your health and well-being.",false
121,Client,"Exactly. I don't want to give up who I am, just make some tweaks here and there.",false
121,Therapist,"That's a great approach. You're starting to see that maybe things weren't as good as you thought they were, and now you have the opportunity to make some positive changes.",false
121,Client,"Yeah, I'm feeling more excited about it now. Maybe this is an opportunity for me to start taking care of myself again.",false
121,Therapist,It's a great idea to focus on self-care and making healthy choices. You're starting to think about what you want to achieve in the next few months.,false
121,Client,"I'd like to make some progress, maybe get back into squash or find a new hobby that keeps me active.",false
121,Therapist,That sounds like a good plan. We can work together to help you set goals and make a plan for achieving them.,false
121,Client,"Yeah, that would be great. And it's nice to have someone to talk to about this, I feel like I've been stuck in a rut for a while.",false
121,Therapist,It's okay to acknowledge that you need help and support. We can work together to get you back on track.,false
121,Client,"Okay, so what's the plan? When should we meet again?",false
121,Therapist,How about in a month's time? We can check in and see how things are going.,false
121,Client,That sounds good. I'm looking forward to it.,false
121,Therapist,"Great. And don't worry, there's no pressure or timeline. We'll just take it one step at a time.",false
121,Client,"Yeah, that's what I like about this. It feels relaxed and low-key.",false
121,Therapist,Exactly. Let's focus on making progress and taking care of yourself.,false
133,Therapist,Thanks for coming in today. I'm glad you're here to explore some ideas with me about your life and what you'd like to change.,false
133,Client,Mm.,false
133,Therapist,"I'm sure we can work together to find ways to make positive changes. So, let's start by talking about what's been on your mind lately. What are some things that have been bothering you or causing you stress?",false
133,Client,"Right. Neat. What, um, what have I changed, what am I—",false
133,Therapist,What have you been thinking about in terms of getting your life back on track? There's something specific that's been nagging at you.,false
133,Client,"I mean, I've been thinking about how easy it would be to deal with P again.",false
133,Therapist,That sounds like a tempting idea. But what are some concerns or reservations you have about going down that path?,false
133,Client,"I mean, I've been thinking about, um, how I could actually set myself up the right way doing it the wrong way.",false
133,Therapist,"So, you're worried about making mistakes and setting yourself back up again. That's a valid concern.",false
133,Client,Mm.,false
133,Therapist,And what do you think is holding you back from taking that first step? Is there something specific that's keeping you from moving forward?,false
133,Client,"Well, at the end of, you know, that last week inside, I was- I had that kind of, okay, what's next buzz? And, you know, it just doesn't work out here.",false
133,Therapist,It sounds like you're feeling a bit stuck and unsure about what to do next. Can you tell me more about what's going through your mind when you think about making a change?,false
133,Client,"I don't have a, uh, uh, I don't know what that is.",false
133,Therapist,"So, it feels like there's a sense of uncertainty or confusion about what you want to do. Let's explore that together.",false
133,Client,Yeah.,false
133,Therapist,And what do you think would happen if you were to make a change? Would it be for better or worse?,false
133,Client,"Yeah, it's worse.",false
133,Therapist,That sounds like a difficult prospect. Can you tell me more about what's at stake for you in this situation?,false
133,Client,"I mean. And I-I can't go back there. There's no decision at all, that's just like, what are you up to if you don't?",false
133,Therapist,It feels like you're feeling trapped and unsure about how to move forward. Let's explore some options together.,false
133,Client,Do they?,false
133,Therapist,Opportunities come and go all the time. Sometimes it's hard to see them clearly. But I'm here to help you explore some possibilities.,false
133,Client,All right. Not to me.,false
133,Therapist,"Well, you said before you had an opportunity to pick up and start dealing again. What made you decide not to take that path?",false
133,Client,"Oh, yeah. Oh, heaps of those opportunities.",false
133,Therapist,It sounds like you're feeling a bit overwhelmed by the choices in front of you. Let's break it down together.,false
133,Client,"Yeah, well, the different world isn't offering me opportunities. The different world is offering me a night shift, and minimum wage, and, you know, nothing. So it's like, set-set yourself up, set your goal up, or, um, don't, and that's your-your pro-social living, and that's your, you know, old behaviors.",false
133,Therapist,It sounds like you're feeling a bit stuck between two options. Let's explore what might be holding you back from making a decision.,false
133,Client,The system?,false
133,Therapist,You're worried about the consequences of making a change. What are some specific concerns you have about leaving your current situation behind?,false
133,Client,"Man, I've been fighting that system—",false
133,Therapist,It sounds like you're feeling a bit trapped by the system and unsure about how to escape.,false
133,Client,-and all it takes me back is to the-the inside-,false
133,Therapist,You're worried about falling back into old patterns. Let's explore some ways to break free from those patterns.,false
133,Client,"Yeah, I know that picture. If I'm gonna make a decision to do this, I kinda need to really-really know what that is.",false
133,Therapist,"So, you want to be clear on what you're getting yourself into before making a decision. That's a wise approach.",false
133,Client,"Yeah, like, I guess I could be wondering that too.",false
133,Therapist,You might have wisdom about what it's like to take a different path. Let's explore some possibilities together.,false
133,Client,There's Fiona.,false
133,Therapist,And maybe there are other people who could support you on this journey as well.,false
20,Therapist,I'd like to discuss Aiden's recent ear infections and your smoking habits at home.,false
20,Client,Okay.,false
20,Therapist,"I'm concerned about how many ear infections he's had, and I noticed you checked the box for secondhand smoke exposure. Can you tell me more about that?",false
20,Client,"Well, it's just us two, and I do smoke. I try not to around him, but I've been smoking for 10 years except when I was pregnant with him. It's hard to quit because everything is so stressful as a single mom.",false
20,Therapist,You're using smoking as a way to cope with stress.,false
20,Client,Yeah. Some people have wine; I have cigarettes.,false
20,Therapist,"So, you're trying not to smoke around Aiden, but it's not that easy for you?",false
20,Client,"Right. I know it's not good for him, but other kids get ear infections, and their parents don't smoke.",false
20,Therapist,You're torn between wanting to protect Aiden from the potential health risks of secondhand smoke and feeling uncertain about whether smoking is really causing these problems.,false
20,Client,"Yeah. He doesn't have asthma, so I'm not sure if it's the smoking that's causing these issues.",false
20,Therapist,What made you quit smoking when you were pregnant?,false
20,Client,"When he was inside me, I knew he'd be exposed to my habits, and I didn't want anything to happen to him. It was a strong motivation for me to quit.",false
20,Therapist,"Now, it feels like quitting is too difficult to even try.",false
20,Client,"Yeah, exactly.",false
20,Therapist,How did you manage to quit smoking in the past?,false
20,Client,"Honestly, I'm not sure; I just did it. The thought of him being born with health problems was unbearable.",false
20,Therapist,"The risks were so overwhelming that you were able to stop then, but they don't feel as scary now.",false
20,Client,"No, I mean, we're two separate people, and I try hard not to smoke around him. It's just easier for me to do that than to quit completely.",false
20,Therapist,"You're doing your best, but it sounds like part of you really wants to quit.",false
20,Client,"Yeah. I know I need to, and every year when the new year starts, I say I'm going to quit smoking, but something always gets in the way.",false
20,Therapist,"Quitting doesn't seem to be a priority for you right now; it's on your list of things to do, but not at the top.",false
20,Client,Yeah.,false
20,Therapist,"If quitting were easy, where would you rate your confidence level right now?",false
20,Client,"Probably like a 5. I know I've done it before, so I know I can do it, but it feels really hard, and it's different this time around.",false
20,Therapist,What makes you say five rather than two or three? Is there something specific that's holding you back?,false
20,Client,"I know all the reasons why smoking is bad for me, and I don't want Aiden to grow up thinking it's okay. But quitting feels impossible right now.",false
20,Therapist,"Okay, so you have a lot of reasons to quit, but you're feeling uncertain about your ability to do it.",false
20,Client,Yeah.,false
20,Therapist,Where would you like to go from here?,false
20,Client,I don't know; I just need help. I'm not sure what kind of help I need.,false
20,Therapist,"If you'd be interested, we can explore some new options together. There are medications that might help, support groups and classes where you can connect with others who are going through the same thing.",false
20,Client,I don't like medicine.,false
20,Therapist,Okay; there's also a lot of support available in terms of classes and groups where you can find community and accountability.,false
20,Client,"That sounds nice, but I'm not sure if it would fit into my life right now.",false
20,Therapist,Let's explore some options that might be more manageable for you. We could set up another appointment to discuss this further.,false
20,Client,That would be great.,false
20,Therapist,Great. Thank you for being open about your struggles with smoking.,false
20,Client,Thank you.,false
23,Therapist,"Hi, Hannah. It's great to meet you too.",false
23,Client,Hi.,false
23,Therapist,So I understand that you've been experiencing anxiety difficulties for about five or six years now.,false
23,Client,"Yeah. Um, yeah, it kind of started like five, six years ago.",false
23,Therapist,"Okay, can you tell me more about what was going through your mind when you first noticed the anxiety?",false
23,Client,"I guess I'd finished school about a year before that. Um, and I mean, I-I've always been a bit shy, um, at school, but it was never ever, uh, like it didn't really affect the things as much as not at all as much as it has been doing the last few years ago, I guess.",false
23,Therapist,So you felt like your anxiety started after you finished school and went to university.,false
23,Client,"Yeah. It's the first time actually, yeah. Um, I was going to a few years ago. I just thought it'd be easier to stay at home, so.",false
23,Therapist,"Okay, so leaving home for the first time was a significant change that might have triggered your anxiety again.",false
23,Client,Yeah.,false
23,Therapist,So how has living on your own affected you?,false
23,Client,"Um, don't know, it's kind of, I haven't really told anyone, so, I mean, it's made it like better in sense. I feel, hopefully this is, this is it like, it- it'll help, but I don't know.",false
23,Therapist,It sounds like you're hoping that living on your own will be a positive change for you.,false
23,Client,Yeah.,false
23,Therapist,So how do you feel about being here today?,false
23,Client,"It's like scared. I don't know. Hopefully, it will help.",false
23,Therapist,You seem to be feeling a bit anxious about coming in today.,false
23,Client,Yeah.,false
23,Therapist,"Okay, so let's go back to when you first started noticing the anxiety. What was going through your mind at that time?",false
23,Client,"I just felt really hot and sweaty, and I don't-- I feel like everyone's kind of looking at me and thinking that I'm just like really stupid.",false
23,Therapist,You were feeling overwhelmed by social interactions and worried about what others might think.,false
23,Client,Yeah.,false
23,Therapist,"So when you got the invitation for the fashion shoot, how did you feel?",false
23,Client,"I was trying to focus on my work, but I felt really anxious. I thought everyone could see that I was shaking and sweating.",false
23,Therapist,You were worried about being judged by others and feeling like you didn't fit in.,false
23,Client,Yeah.,false
23,Therapist,How did you try to cope with those feelings?,false
23,Client,"I tried to grip the camera tightly, hoping it would help me focus and not draw attention to myself.",false
23,Therapist,So holding onto the camera was a way for you to feel more grounded and less self-conscious.,false
23,Client,Yeah.,false
23,Therapist,What did you think others might be thinking about you during that shoot?,false
23,Client,"Just that I'm stupid, and they could tell I was really sweaty and shaking.",false
23,Therapist,You felt like everyone was staring at you and judging your performance.,false
23,Client,Yeah.,false
23,Therapist,How did the experience end for you?,false
23,Client,"It kind of went on for an hour or so, and then I just wanted to get home as quickly as possible.",false
41,Therapist,"So, it's great that you're here today to explore your thoughts and feelings with me.",false
41,Client,Yes.,false
41,Therapist,How are you feeling right now?,false
41,Client,I feel great actually.,false
41,Therapist,That's wonderful. Can you tell me more about what's contributing to this positive feeling?,false
41,Client,"Yeah. It was a good, uh, experience for me. It was different. It was different than usual. There were several things that were different, and, uh, the number one value that I put was self-respect. And I-I don't even know if self-respect has ever been in my top five let alone my number one.",false
41,Therapist,That's really interesting. Can you help me understand why self-respect is so important to you now?,false
41,Client,"I do have an idea, I think, why that is. Um, I think that there's been a few things that have happened recently and something that really came to my awareness, when I visited with my family, is that I have consistently through my whole life, probably, put other people first. And I have consistently, uh, almost not even considered myself in the equation.",false
41,Therapist,That sounds like a heavy burden to carry. How do you think this has affected your sense of self?,false
41,Client,"I feel like it's never too late to change and I feel like I can- I can, uh, respect and value myself just as much as I have other people. I know that's important. And I feel like when I do that, I'm a better person for other people as well.",false
41,Therapist,That makes sense. It sounds like you're recognizing the importance of prioritizing yourself.,false
41,Client,"Yeah. Because I get stressed, I get resentful, I get overwhelmed and, uh, out of- out of alignment, I guess, out of sorts.",false
41,Therapist,I can imagine how that would feel. Can you tell me more about what it's like when you're feeling stressed or overwhelmed?,false
41,Client,And I can't be the best- the best me possible.,false
41,Therapist,For yourself or for someone else?,false
41,Client,"Yeah. For myself or for someone else, either way, yeah.",false
41,Therapist,You think that putting others first has led to feelings of neglecting yourself.,false
41,Client,"I-it's almost-- Like, I think that some people might not even think that I put that first, but in my mind and my emotions, I was carrying concern about what other people think, and I was letting that concern dictate my actions.",false
41,Therapist,That's a really insightful observation. Can you tell me more about how this has affected your relationships with others?,false
41,Client,"And that's something that I had done for so long, literally since I was a child, that I didn't even know I was doing it.",false
41,Therapist,It sounds like you've been carrying around this pattern of behavior without even realizing it.,false
41,Client,There's so much of your-- Part of your paradigm?,false
41,Client,"Yes, yes.",false
41,Therapist,"So, do you think sometimes you weren't even aware of the impact that others were having on your own thoughts and feelings?",false
41,Client,"Not aware at all. Completely unaware. Totally unaware, yeah.",false
41,Therapist,That's a powerful realization. Can you tell me more about what it feels like to have this awareness now?,false
41,Client,"And so to me, I feel like it's a celebration. I used to, uh, moan and complain about my childhood and about all the things that I didn't get to have, and all the cruel, mean things that people said and did, and I felt-- I feel like I had this aha moment where I realized that I could be my own parent, and I could give myself the things that weren't given to me.",false
41,Therapist,That's amazing. It sounds like you're feeling a sense of hope and renewal.,false
41,Client,"So, that's what I want to do.",false
41,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
41,Therapist,You feel like this is an opportunity for growth and change.,false
41,Client,And it's the first time in my life I haven't felt guilty for saying that.,false
41,Therapist,It sounds like you're finally feeling empowered to make changes in your life.,false
41,Client,"-it's not, it's really not.",false
41,Therapist,You don't feel like this is a selfish thing at all.,false
41,Client,No-,false
41,Therapist,You're recognizing the importance of prioritizing yourself and your own needs.,false
41,Client,"-it's not, it's really not.",false
41,Therapist,That's great to hear. Can you tell me more about what it feels like when you prioritize yourself?,false
41,Client,"And then I have health and achievement, and to me, this one on achievement says a sense of accomplishment and to me that kind of goes along with what we were talking about earlier like I think I can show up and be a teacher and be a counselor in many different, uh, capacities.",false
41,Therapist,You feel like you're able to pursue your passions and interests without feeling overwhelmed.,false
41,Client,But I don't feel good about that.,false
41,Therapist,It's because you showed up and you gave out,false
41,Client,"It's not enough for me to just show up and get my paycheck. That doesn't, I don't feel fulfilled so it-it, that's the way I see it going together with the helping.",false
41,Therapist,You want to make sure that your work is meaningful and fulfilling.,false
41,Client,"Yeah, meaningful, even if it's-it's small.",false
41,Therapist,"Sometimes it's the small things that really count, too.",false
41,Client,Yeah.,false
41,Therapist,It sounds like you're recognizing the importance of finding joy and fulfillment in your work.,false
41,Client,"So, all of these things put together feel like right now at this point in life, that it is really healthy change for you, like where you are right now.",false
41,Client,Yeah. Yeah.,false
41,Therapist,You feel like this is a positive and empowering time in your life.,false
41,Client,That's great and is there anything else on the list you felt like it was coming close to some of the other top five that you had or something similar?,false
41,Client,"Well, one of the things about this list that kind of surprised me is almost every time I have done this list, uh, creativity and freedom have been really high up there.",false
41,Therapist,You feel like these values are interconnected.,false
41,Client,"But I think the conclusion that I came to is that I can be more creative and have more freedom if I have inner peace and self-respect. Part of what- part of what binds me, part of what takes my freedom away is when I just explain all over the place and I don't give any attention to myself.",false
41,Therapist,You recognize that your thoughts and feelings can be a source of creativity and freedom.,false
41,Client,Part of what steals my creativity is when I'm- my mind is reeling around in stress and I am not- I can't even hear myself. I can't even hear myself think. How can you be creative if you can't even hear yourself?,false
41,Therapist,You're recognizing the importance of silence and quiet contemplation.,false
41,Client,"Yeah, exactly, to me the creativity comes from the silence, comes from the quiet.",false
41,Therapist,It sounds like you've found a new source of inspiration and creativity.,false
41,Client,Thank you so much for sharing.,false
44,Therapist,"Hi Andrea, thanks for coming in today. I want to start by saying how much I appreciate you taking this time to talk with me about your life and goals.",false
44,Client,Okay.,false
44,Therapist,"So, can you tell me a little bit about yourself? What are some things that bring you joy and fulfillment?",false
44,Client,"Well, my name is Andrea, as you know, I'm in the marching band. I play the tenor sax.",false
44,Therapist,That's great! It sounds like music plays an important role in your life. Can you tell me more about what it means to you?,false
44,Client,"Yeah. I'm involved in music. So I'm also in the jazz band, the wind ensemble, and um, yeah, that's about—",false
44,Therapist,"Okay, so music is a big part of your life. How did you get started with playing instruments?",false
44,Client,"Well, saxophone. I started about four years ago, but I've been involved in music for about 10 years now, so.",false
44,Therapist,"Wow, that's impressive! What other instruments have you played over the years?",false
44,Client,I started off on the violin first.,false
44,Therapist,That's interesting. How did you transition from violin to saxophone?,false
44,Client,"So I played that for like six years, once a clarinet, dabbled here and there with different things. And then I found the one- the one for me.",false
44,Therapist,It sounds like you've had a lot of experience playing different instruments. What is it about the tenor saxophone that resonates with you?,false
44,Client,"Yeah, the tenor sax.",false
44,Therapist,You've been in marching band since freshman year. How has your experience in the band impacted your life?,false
44,Client,Marching band since freshman year. So like three years.,false
44,Therapist,That's great! What are some of the things that you enjoy most about being in the band?,false
44,Client,"It's fun. It's a- it's a lot of work, long summers taught, but it's fun.",false
44,Therapist,I can imagine! It sounds like the camaraderie and sense of accomplishment are big draws for you. What do you think is the most rewarding part about being in the band?,false
44,Client,"Oh, I really like the-the group setting.",false
44,Therapist,That makes sense. Being part of a team can be very fulfilling. Can you tell me more about what you enjoy about that aspect of the band?,false
44,Client,"You know, getting to work with my other classmates and things like that. And putting on this entire show-",false
44,Therapist,I can see why that would be exciting! It sounds like the sense of community and shared purpose is a big part of your experience in the band.,false
44,Client,It's very cool.,false
44,Therapist,That's great to hear! Do you have friends outside of the band who share similar interests?,false
44,Client,Yeah.,false
44,Therapist,That's wonderful. How do you balance your friendships with those outside of the band with your commitments to the band?,false
44,Client,"I have, um, you know, I have two-two separate groups. I have my friends from class and then my friends from bra-- from band.",false
44,Therapist,"Okay, so it sounds like you have a strong support system in both areas of your life. How do you think that balance works for you?",false
44,Client,So.,false
44,Therapist,It's great to hear that you're able to navigate multiple relationships effectively. Let's talk about your family a bit. What can you tell me about them?,false
44,Client,"Oh, well I have one brother he's older than me, about nine years older than me.",false
44,Therapist,That's wonderful! How do you feel about your relationship with your brother?,false
44,Client,"And, uh, my parents and my dog. [laughs]",false
44,Therapist,"It sounds like your family is very important to you. What can you tell me about your dog, Charlie?",false
44,Client,He's a golden retriever.,false
44,Therapist,That's great! How long have you had Charlie?,false
44,Client,He's about eight years old now.,false
44,Therapist,"Wow, he must be quite the companion! Have you always wanted to get a dog like that?",false
44,Client,Yeah. He's about eight years old now.,false
44,Therapist,"Okay, so it sounds like Charlie has been a part of your life for a while. What are your plans for after high school?",false
44,Client,"Uh, well, I'm planning on going to school. I'd like to become a doctor one day, so.",false
44,Therapist,"That's amazing! You have big dreams, and it's great that you're thinking about your future. Can you tell me more about what drew you to the field of medicine?",false
44,Client,"I'm interested in psychology, psychiatry, something like that, so.",false
44,Therapist,You've got a lot of passion and interest in this area! What do you think will be the most challenging part of pursuing a career in medicine?,false
44,Client,Yeah.,false
44,Therapist,"Okay, so it sounds like you're thinking about the potential obstacles. How do you plan to overcome them?",false
44,Client,Yeah.,false
44,Therapist,"Cool. All right, let's talk about schools and majors. What are your thoughts on that?",false
44,Client,"Yeah, psychology, I haven't really thought too about which school, I mean, I-",false
44,Therapist,"Right, it can be overwhelming with all the options available. Do you have any ideas or preferences for specific schools or programs?",false
44,Client,"Everyone wants to shoot for the Ivy leagues, so [chuckles]",false
44,Therapist,That's understandable! It sounds like you're aware of the prestige and desirability of those schools.,false
44,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
44,Therapist,"Okay, so what about your grades? How do you think they will impact your future plans?",false
44,Client,"Uh, they're pretty good, you know, high three-point somethings.",false
44,Therapist,That's great to hear! Your academic performance is a strong foundation for your future goals. What are some things that you enjoy doing on the weekends?,false
44,Client,"Uh, I usually go out with my friends. Uh, we'll go to the movies or we'll most likely we'll just meet up at someone's house-",false
44,Therapist,Mm-hmm.,false
44,Client,-and just hang out and things.,false
44,Therapist,"When you're hanging out, is there ever alcohol involved?",false
44,Client,"Sometimes, [chuckles] I'm gonna be honest sometimes.",false
44,Therapist,"Okay, so it sounds like you do enjoy socializing with friends. How often do you think you drink alcohol when you're out?",false
44,Client,"Um, depending on how much schoolwork there is When there's not, it might be like every other weekend or like three weekends out of the month or something like that.",false
44,Therapist,So you tend to drink more frequently when you have less schoolwork. How does that impact your decision-making and behavior?,false
44,Client,"A little, yeah.",false
44,Therapist,"Okay, so it sounds like you're aware of how drinking can affect your judgment and actions. Have you ever felt like you've made poor choices while drinking?",false
44,Client,I have gotten blackout drunk before-,false
44,Therapist,Mm-hmm.,false
44,Client,"-but I kind of did that, learned my lesson, didn't like it.",false
44,Therapist,Got it. So you've had some experiences with heavy drinking in the past. What do you think is the most you've ever had?,false
44,Client,Like how many drinks?,false
44,Therapist,Yeah.,false
44,Client,"Um, it was a good amount. It was the first time I ever drank and it was like three or four cups, but it was mixing different things.",false
44,Therapist,"Okay, so you're not entirely sure about the number of drinks. Have your friends also been drinking heavily?",false
44,Client,"Yeah. Yes. Not all of them, but some of them do.",false
44,Therapist,"Okay, so it sounds like there's a bit of variation in terms of drinking habits among your friends. How does that impact your decision-making when you're out with them?",false
44,Client,"More or less the same amount. So right now the most we'll have is maybe like one cup after that one time, but sometimes one or two, but they can be kind of heavy.",false
44,Therapist,"Okay, so it's not always a straightforward situation. What do you think about your drinking habits in general?",false
44,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
44,Therapist,You're aware that your level of drinking puts you in a high-risk group for certain negative consequences. Have you thought about those things before?,false
44,Client,A little bit.,false
44,Therapist,"Yeah, it's good that you're starting to consider the potential risks. Do you think it's surprising to you that you fall into this category?",false
44,Client,A little bit.,false
44,Therapist,"Okay, so it sounds like you're not entirely surprised by your situation. Let's talk about setting a goal for quitting drinking. Are you willing to make some changes in your life?",false
44,Client,Okay.,false
44,Therapist,Great! I think we can work together to set a goal and create a plan for making those changes. What do you say? Are you ready to start working on this?,false
44,Client,Okay.,false
44,Therapist,"Awesome! Let's get started then. How do you plan to quit drinking, and what steps will you take to make that happen?",false
44,Client,"Yeah, I think I could. I don't need it. For instance, it-it is-- it is used as a kind of, like, let's get the party going.",false
44,Therapist,"Okay, so you're thinking about quitting drinking because you realize it's not serving you well. What do you think will be the most challenging part of this process?",false
44,Client,"Yeah, I think it would be when everyone else around me is drinking and then there's like that pressure-",false
44,Therapist,Mm-hmm.,false
44,Client,"-of, ""Oh, they're gonna think I look stupid.""",false
44,Therapist,"Okay, so you're worried about what others might think. How do you plan to handle those situations?",false
44,Client,Yeah.,false
44,Therapist,"Okay, so it sounds like you're thinking about how to communicate your boundaries clearly and assertively. What if someone asks you why you're not drinking when they are?",false
44,Client,"My close ones, I know they wouldn't be, you know, have a problem with that. But the ones that I'm not that close with, but I'll still like hang out with-",false
44,Therapist,Mm-hmm.,false
44,Client,-those are probably the ones that like might ostracize me for something or.,false
44,Therapist,It sounds like you're thinking about how to prioritize your own needs and boundaries in those situations. Do you think it's worth it to cut ties with friends who don't support you?,false
44,Client,Yeah.,false
44,Therapist,"Okay, so you think it's better to surround yourself with people who do support you. That makes sense! What if someone asks you why you're quitting drinking? How will you respond?",false
44,Client,Like how should I go about that situation?,false
44,Therapist,"Well, one good option would be to just review the reasons why you want to quit drinking and share those with your friends.",false
44,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
44,Therapist,"You could say something like, ""I've thought a lot about this, and I realize it's not healthy for me. I don't want to become an alcoholic or put myself at risk for health problems.""",false
44,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
44,Therapist,"Or you could mention the potential consequences of drinking too much, such as accidents or poor decision-making. What do you think would be most effective in communicating your message?",false
44,Client,I have gotten blackout drunk before-,false
44,Therapist,Mm-hmm.,false
44,Client,"-but I kind of did that, learned my lesson, didn't like it.",false
44,Therapist,Got it. So you've had some experiences with heavy drinking in the past and have learned from them. What do you think will be the most important thing to focus on when quitting drinking?,false
44,Client,Yeah.,false
44,Therapist,"Okay, so it sounds like you're thinking about how to stay motivated and focused on your goal. How can we work together to make sure you succeed?",false
44,Client,"It'd be easier as-- You Know, as a group we-we all work together to become better.",false
44,Therapist,"Yeah. Exactly! All right, I think that's a great plan. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we wrap up today?",false
44,Client,No. I think- I think I'm good.,false
44,Therapist,"Okay, so let's summarize what we've talked about and make sure you feel confident in your decision to quit drinking. We'll check in with each other soon.",false
44,Client,Okay.,false
44,Therapist,Great! I'll plan to meet with you again in a couple of weeks.,false
44,Client,Okay.,false
44,Therapist,And make sure that you actually quit drinking.,false
44,Client,Okay.,false
44,Therapist,All right.,false
44,Client,Sound good.,false
44,Therapist,Great.,false
35,Therapist,"Hi, Natalie. I'm Dawn.",false
35,Client,"Hi, Dawn. Nice to meet you.",false
35,Therapist,Nice to meet you too. Thanks for coming in today.,false
35,Client,Thanks for having me.,false
35,Therapist,"Yeah, it's great that you're taking this step. Can you tell me a little bit about yourself?",false
35,Client,"So I am 28, and I moved out to Arizona six months ago. Um, I really enjoy spending time with my family and hanging out with friends whenever I can. Work keeps me pretty busy. But I'm really looking to make some changes to my diet and physical activity. I'm not really happy with where my weight's at right now, and so I thought it'd be good to come and talk with you about some of that stuff.",false
35,Therapist,You're feeling a bit dissatisfied with your health patterns lately?,false
35,Client,"Yeah. Um, I'm really starting to notice how I feel more sluggish and just not – My mood is shifted a lot too, which at first, I thought was because it's getting colder outside, um, but I do also think it maybe has some relation to my activity, or lack thereof, and also kind of the foods that I'm eating.",false
35,Therapist,"You're feeling low energy, and you've noticed in the past that when you were more active and eating differently, you had more energy?",false
35,Client,Right. Yeah. Especially during times when I'm more active is when I noticed the biggest change in energy and mood.,false
35,Therapist,Can you tell me more about those previous times when you were active?,false
35,Client,"Yeah. Um, well, I played sports in college, so that kept me pretty busy, and that was really fun, um, and I just think back now to, as much that I would cram into a 24-hour period, and like, wonder how I did that, but I think that part of it was because I was so active physically, um, I just had way more energy throughout the day, mentally and physically.",false
35,Therapist,You felt like you were on top of your game when you were physically active.,false
35,Client,"Yeah, yeah, exactly. And now it's not so much the same. Um, like when I get home from work, I'm pretty exhausted, uh, it takes a lot for me to want to be physically active when I've spent all day staring at a computer and thinking and working.",false
35,Therapist,"Your days are just as full now that you're working and pursuing your career, but your energy level isn't what it used to be. What do you think might have caused this shift?",false
35,Client,"Um, well, I think part of it is that when I was in college, it wasn't really an option to go, like, I had to go to practice or I had to do those things because that was, in a sense, my job that was paying for school, um, and now there's not that same commitment to other people or to scholarship money.",false
35,Therapist,So you're feeling a bit lost about how to prioritize your time now that the structure of college is gone.,false
35,Client,"I-I do feel like an urgency to go it just doesn't seem that like the step that's missing is for me to actually go to a gym or somewhere to be more active. Like, I think I want to it's just the doing it that seems to not happen.",false
35,Therapist,It sounds like you're feeling a bit stuck about how to make physical activity a priority in your life.,false
35,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
35,Therapist,You've noticed a mood enhancement effect of exercise. Can you tell me more about what that's been like for you?,false
35,Client,"Just, I'm-I'm just happier and more upbeat and I think that even my outlook is more positive. So like, if I'm sitting in traffic, and I haven't been physically active, I'll probably grumble about it but if I'm sitting in traffic, and I have been, it's like, I just have a different outlook on things and I already feel like I've gotten something accomplished that day.",false
35,Therapist,You feel more confident and less irritated when you're physically active.,false
35,Client,"Mm-hmm. Yeah, exactly.",false
35,Therapist,"Great. Well, let me summarize what we've discussed so far. You came to Arizona six months ago, you're trying to figure out new rhythms and patterns for yourself. You're looking back at the past few years, and in college, you were really active because you were an athlete, and now it's more up to you about making that choice of physical activity, and you're discovering that not being active has affected your energy level and your mood.",false
35,Client,"Yeah. And then also to, um, like I mentioned, I'm not totally happy with my weight, um, and so hoping too that that would have some impact there and-and maybe help me, um, if my activity kind of gets resolved or improves, then my nutrition also, maybe would go along with it and get better.",false
35,Therapist,You're hoping that improving your physical activity will also lead to positive changes in your weight and overall well-being.,false
35,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
35,Therapist,"Okay, so you started feeling dissatisfied with your body about three months ago. Can you tell me more about what was going through your mind during that time?",false
35,Client,"Uh, probably about three, four months ago. Um, yeah, just my clothes started fitting tighter, which wasn't as comfortable, and, um, yeah, just not really super happy with my appearance, which has never really been an issue, um, in my life up until now.",false
35,Therapist,You're feeling a bit of a crisis about your body image.,false
35,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
35,Therapist,I wonder if the lack of physical activity and maybe some unhealthy eating habits are contributing to this negative self-image. Is that something you've noticed?,false
35,Client,"Yeah, I think- I think the activity piece and then also to like, the foods that I'm eating, I don't think are that great.",false
35,Therapist,So you're feeling a bit stuck in a cycle where your lack of physical activity is affecting your mood and body image.,false
35,Client,Mm-hmm. Yeah.,false
35,Therapist,Great.,false
38,Therapist,"Hi, Sarah, it's great to meet you. I'm Delwyn, a counselor here at the clinic, and I've been told that your nurse practitioner mentioned some concerns about smoking and alcohol use during your recent annual exam. Can you tell me more about what was discussed?",false
38,Client,"Yeah, um, last week I met with my nurse practitioner, and she's worried about how much I'm smoking and drinking right now. I agreed to cut back on the smoking, but I don't really think I drink that much.",false
38,Therapist,"So, you've decided to reduce your smoking, but you're not too concerned about your drinking.",false
38,Client,"Right, I mean, I don't drink that much, and it's just a good way for me to relax.",false
38,Therapist,It does seem like a helpful stress-relief mechanism.,false
38,Client,"Yeah, exactly. It's kind of like my time at the end of the day.",false
38,Therapist,You find it essential to unwind after a long day.,false
38,Client,"Yeah. I have a two-year-old son and work full-time, plus I'm going back to school. So, juggling all that is really tiring, and I just want to relax and enjoy myself.",false
38,Therapist,That sounds incredibly challenging with your work schedule and family responsibilities.,false
38,Client,"Yeah, and for my job as a server, it's exhausting being on my feet all day trying to please customers while also worrying about making enough money to support my son.",false
38,Therapist,It must be very stressful to balance those demands.,false
38,Client,"Yeah, and then I'm worried about paying for school and daycare. So, it's just a lot right now.",false
38,Therapist,You're feeling overwhelmed by the financial pressures and responsibilities.,false
38,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
38,Therapist,Can you tell me more about your drinking? What led to concerns from your nurse practitioner?,false
38,Client,"Well, I don't really understand what raised concern. I mean, I don't drink that much – maybe two drinks a day at most.",false
38,Therapist,You're concerned about the recommended limits for women and how they might apply to you.,false
38,Client,"Not much. But if there were some guidelines or recommendations, I'd be interested in hearing them.",false
38,Therapist,"Okay, so let's explore those guidelines together. For women, it's generally recommended to limit daily drinking to no more than three drinks and weekly consumption to no more than seven drinks.",false
38,Client,"That does seem a bit excessive for me, especially since my family members drink much more than that without any issues.",false
38,Therapist,It might not be as concerning for you as it is for others in your family.,false
38,Client,"No. And then I'm just getting kind of annoyed because everything I enjoy seems to be being taken away from me right now – like, if I give up drinking, what will I have left to relax with?",false
38,Therapist,You feel like you need that reward or stress relief.,false
38,Client,"Yeah, yeah.",false
38,Therapist,It sounds like your drinking has increased as a way to cope with the stress of your busy life.,false
38,Client,"Yeah, I guess it has. Probably just because I'm so stressed out every day – I'm in my second semester of school now, and adding that to everything is really tough.",false
38,Therapist,You're feeling overwhelmed by your academic responsibilities and other obligations.,false
38,Client,"Yeah, and then I worry about childcare. My mom normally watches my son, but she's been backing out lately, so I'm worried about finding reliable care.",false
38,Therapist,It sounds like having a consistent childcare solution is crucial for you right now.,false
38,Client,"Yeah, definitely. And it's hard because I feel bad – it's not her son, after all – but I need something I can rely on better.",false
38,Therapist,Having a stable and affordable childcare arrangement could make a huge difference in reducing your stress levels.,false
38,Client,Yeah.,false
38,Therapist,"It seems like money is also a significant concern for you, as it would allow you to afford daycare and potentially reduce your work hours or school commitments.",false
38,Client,"Yeah. If I had more money, I could afford daycare, I could work less hours, you know?",false
38,Therapist,That's a key factor in reducing your stress levels right now.,false
38,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
38,Therapist,"Given our conversation so far, it seems like you're open to exploring ways to cope with stress without relying on drinking as much. You've mentioned childcare and financial concerns as major issues.",false
38,Client,"Yeah, I mean, I could try going back to one drink a night instead of two.",false
38,Therapist,"Let's aim for that goal and see how it goes, especially considering your efforts to cut back on smoking.",false
38,Client,"Yeah. I don't know how it'll go, but I can try.",false
38,Therapist,That's a good starting point. We can monitor progress and adjust as needed.,false
38,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
38,Therapist,It seems like we have two main areas to focus on – reducing your drinking and finding more reliable childcare solutions.,false
38,Client,I don't think so.,false
38,Therapist,"Okay, well, let's schedule a follow-up session in a couple of weeks to discuss how things are going with both those areas. Sound good?",false
38,Client,Yeah.,false
38,Therapist,Great. I look forward to talking next time and seeing how you're progressing.,false
38,Client,Okay. Thanks.,false
56,Therapist,"Hi, Mrs. Smith. I'm Denise. I work with Dr. Fields and the team here at the clinic to support individuals like you who are recovering from rehab and returning home.",false
56,Client,Pretty good.,false
56,Therapist,Can you tell me a little bit about how your experience has been since you got home?,false
56,Client,"Yeah. Um, I'm glad to be there.",false
56,Therapist,What specifically brings you relief or joy in being back home?,false
56,Client,"Uh, well, I'm glad to see my dog, he's very cute, and it just feels good to be home.",false
56,Therapist,That sounds wonderful. It's clear that having your dog here with you is a source of comfort.,false
56,Client,"Yeah. And my garden is coming along, and my neighbors have stuff-- It's-it's good. It's good to be home.",false
56,Therapist,I sense that being in a familiar environment and reconnecting with loved ones has been helpful for you.,false
56,Client,Yeah. And I'm glad I can take care of myself here.,false
56,Therapist,"That's great. However, it sounds like there was an incident recently where you had a semi-fall. Can you tell me more about that?",false
56,Client,"Well, um. I-I didn't get- go to physical therapy this week, and the- or Tai Chi, actually.",false
56,Therapist,It seems like you're feeling a bit uncertain about your progress with physical therapy and Tai Chi. What was going through your mind when you had that fall?,false
56,Client,"Yeah. Well, um. Actually, I-I had a little semi fall, I didn't fall down, I didn't fall down completely but I-I did-- I guess I still had the wobblies and I was hoping that the physical therapy and the Tai Chi would be- get me further along than it has, and I-I still don't have the balance. So, I'm thinking that maybe I was pushing too hard, that maybe I should cut back, you know, and kind of not try so hard to-to keep moving like that.",false
56,Therapist,It sounds like you're feeling a bit overwhelmed by your recovery process and worried that you might be pushing yourself too hard.,false
56,Client,"Yeah, yeah.",false
56,Therapist,You've worked really hard to get home and continue with physical therapy and Tai Chi. Can you tell me more about what's been on your mind lately?,false
56,Client,Yeah.,false
56,Therapist,"It seems like you're feeling a bit frustrated that the physical therapy isn't helping as much as you'd hoped, and you're questioning whether Tai Chi is still right for you.",false
56,Client,"Yeah, yeah.",false
56,Therapist,"I understand that it can be disheartening when progress doesn't happen as quickly as we'd like. However, it's great that you're open to exploring other options.",false
56,Client,That I will definitely- I definitely wanna do that.,false
56,Therapist,"Let's explore the possibility of continuing with physical therapy and see how it goes. We can also look into other resources that might be helpful for you, such as case management services or support groups.",false
56,Client,Yeah. I think that would be good. Do you think I should try to go back to the Tai Chi?,false
56,Therapist,"Yes, let's consider it as an option and see how it goes. We can also look into other activities at the senior center that might be a better fit for you.",false
56,Client,"Yeah. I guess I've kind of gone to the extreme. I tend to do that. [chuckles] Yeah. So, keep moving?",false
56,Therapist,It's not about being too active or too passive; it's about finding a balance that works for you and makes you feel safe.,false
56,Client,Really?,false
56,Therapist,"Yes, research has shown that staying physically active can actually help reduce the risk of falls.",false
56,Client,"Oh, okay.",false
56,Therapist,We want to support you in finding ways to stay safe and engaged while also enjoying your life at home.,false
56,Client,"Well, and she- she's not going to throw me back into the hospital?",false
56,Therapist,Not yet. We're here to help you find a way to stay at home safely and comfortably.,false
56,Client,Not yet? [laughs] Okay. Yeah. I was sort of- I-I was sort of hesitant to tell you-,false
56,Therapist,"It takes courage to share your concerns, and I appreciate your trust in me.",false
56,Client,"-about this, but, um, uh, I'm sort of glad I did. I'm very glad I did.",false
56,Therapist,I'm really glad too. This is the only way we can work together to help you feel safer.,false
56,Client,Yeah.,false
56,Therapist,We'll get you set up with case management services and make sure they happen.,false
56,Client,And-and that's-- Yeah.,false
56,Therapist,Having a lifeline or emergency response system in place can provide peace of mind and ensure your safety.,false
56,Client,"I mean, that alone, to know that I have communication that I w- that was my biggest fear that something-",false
56,Therapist,It's great that you're taking steps to address your concerns and find ways to stay safe at home.,false
56,Client,-would happen and I wouldn't have any-,false
56,Therapist,You're not being a baby; this is a completely normal response to a challenging situation.,false
56,Client,Really?,false
56,Therapist,"Yes, it's actually a sign of strength that you're acknowledging your fears and seeking help.",false
56,Client,Thank you. Thank you.,false
56,Therapist,We'll work together to make sure you have the support and resources you need to stay at home safely.,false
56,Client,"Well, and she- she's not going to throw me back into the hospital?",false
56,Therapist,Not yet. We're committed to helping you find a way to stay at home where you can feel safe and comfortable.,false
56,Client,Okay. Yeah. I was sort of- I-I was sort of hesitant to tell you-,false
56,Therapist,It's okay; we're here to listen and support you every step of the way.,false
56,Client,"-about this, but, um, uh, I'm sort of glad I did. I'm very glad I did.",false
56,Therapist,I'm really glad too.,false
50,Therapist,"Okay, so it sounds like your doctor thinks your blood pressure might be a bit high, but you're not convinced that's a problem. Can you tell me more about what makes you feel that way?",false
50,Client,"Well, I guess I just don't see the issue with my eating habits being perfect. And I do eat really well.",false
50,Therapist,"You mentioned earlier that you felt like caffeine might be causing some of your agitation. Are you still feeling that way, or have you changed your mind about it?",false
50,Client,"Honestly, sometimes it makes me a bit jittery and I need to use the bathroom more often than my coworkers do. But at the same time, it keeps me awake and alert, which helps me do my job better.",false
50,Therapist,That's understandable. It sounds like you're weighing the pros and cons of your caffeine consumption. Can you tell me more about what those pros and cons are for you?,false
50,Client,"Yeah, I guess I just feel like being aware of what's going on is really important to me. And it makes me feel more observant.",false
50,Therapist,That's a great point. It sounds like being alert and aware is something that's very valuable to you. Are there any other factors that might be contributing to your feelings about caffeine?,false
50,Client,"Well, I have four cups a day, which seems like the right amount to me. And it's not just me – my coworkers who work at night bring in coffee, so we're all pretty caffeinated.",false
50,Therapist,"Okay, got it. So you feel like reducing your caffeine intake might be worth exploring, but you're not sure what that would mean for you.",false
50,Client,"Yeah, I guess I'd need to figure out how much to cut back on. But I really do like my morning coffee ritual – making the coffee and enjoying the flavors is something I look forward to every day.",false
50,Therapist,"That sounds like a great part of your routine. It's understandable that you wouldn't want to give that up. Are there any other factors that might be contributing to your feelings about caffeine, such as your work schedule?",false
50,Client,"Yeah, working 12-hour shifts can be tough, and I think the afternoon coffee really helps me get through it.",false
50,Therapist,"Okay, so we've identified one potential area for you to explore – reducing your caffeine intake. What do you think about that? Is there anything that's holding you back from making a change?",false
50,Client,I think that might be okay. I could probably cut back on the mid-morning coffee if it would help.,false
50,Therapist,That sounds like a great compromise. It seems like we've identified one area where you might be willing to make a small adjustment to see how it goes.,false
50,Client,"Yeah, I think that does sound all right.",false
50,Therapist,"Okay, so we'll explore reducing your caffeine intake for now and see how that goes. What do you think about that?",false
50,Client,"Yeah, I think I could do that.",false
50,Therapist,Good.,false
62,Therapist,How are you feeling today?,false
62,Client,"I'm good, thanks.",false
62,Therapist,That's great. Can you tell me a bit about what's been going on since we last spoke?,false
62,Client,"Um, everything seems fine. My caseworker mentioned community service, but I'm not entirely sure about the details.",false
62,Therapist,"Okay, it sounds like you're still trying to figure some things out.",false
62,Client,"Yeah, that's right. She said I need to get a certain number of hours in, but I don't know exactly how or where.",false
62,Therapist,"So, can you walk me through what your conversation with the caseworker was like? What did she say about community service?",false
62,Client,"I remember her saying I have to do it by the end of my probation, but I'm not sure how many hours or if someone else will find a place for me.",false
62,Therapist,"Okay, got it. So, you know that it's an important part of your probation, but you're feeling a bit fuzzy on the details.",false
62,Client,"Exactly, yeah.",false
62,Therapist,Would you be okay with me sharing some information about community service requirements and maybe helping you explore some options?,false
62,Client,"Yeah, that sounds good.",false
62,Therapist,"Great. So, it looks like you have 25 hours left to complete, which needs to be done by the end of your probation.",false
62,Client,That's right.,false
62,Therapist,"Your case manager is a great resource for finding a place where you can do community service. We've had clients who've done their service at places like food pantries or shelters, and there's also an urban ecology center that might be a good fit – it's outdoors, and they work with younger kids.",false
62,Client,"Yeah, I'm interested in that.",false
62,Therapist,"So, we can help you explore those options. You'll need to work with your case manager to find a place that fits your needs, but she can also provide guidance on how to get started.",false
62,Client,Okay.,false
62,Therapist,"And if you're feeling overwhelmed or struggling to find a place, we can definitely support you in making phone calls to explore those options together.",false
62,Client,That sounds good.,false
62,Therapist,Would it be helpful for you to create a plan and track your progress? Maybe using a calendar to mark out the hours you complete each day?,false
62,Client,"Yeah, that would help me keep track better.",false
62,Therapist,"And if you're committed, I think you could easily get all 25 hours done in a week during summer break.",false
62,Client,That sounds doable.,false
62,Therapist,Is there anything else you'd like to know or discuss about community service?,false
62,Client,"I think that's it. I was just worried about who would help me find a place, but now I understand I need to take the lead on that myself.",false
62,Therapist,"Okay, well, we're here to support you every step of the way. If you have any more questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out.",false
62,Client,"Alright, thank you.",false
62,Therapist,You're welcome.,false
68,Therapist,"Hi, Andrea, thanks for coming to talk with me today.",false
68,Client,Hi. Thank you.,false
68,Therapist,So I want to start by explaining my role in this process and why you're here. Can you tell me a little bit about what's been on your mind lately?,false
68,Client,Okay.,false
68,Therapist,"My job is to meet with all students, including you, once or twice a semester, to discuss how things are going and any changes you might want to make in your life.",false
68,Client,Okay.,false
68,Therapist,Does that sound like it aligns with what you're hoping to get out of our conversations?,false
68,Client,Yeah.,false
68,Therapist,All right. So why don't we start by you telling me a little bit about yourself and what's been going on in your life lately?,false
68,Client,"Sure. Um, as you know, I'm Andrea, I'm a junior, and I play the tenor sax in the marching band.",false
68,Therapist,"Oh, that sounds like a lot of fun! What made you decide to pursue music?",false
68,Client,"Yeah, [crosstalk].",false
68,Therapist,When did you start playing the saxophone?,false
68,Client,"Oh, I started about 10 years ago.",false
68,Therapist,"Wow, you've been playing for a long time. What was it like when you first started out?",false
68,Client,"Yeah, [laughs].",false
68,Therapist,"Just kind of everyday stuff, right? No big deal.",false
68,Client,Yeah [laughs].,false
68,Therapist,Okay. Tell me a little bit about your family and what they're like.,false
68,Client,"Uh, well I have one older brother; he's about eight and a half years older than me. My parents, and I have a dog.",false
68,Therapist,That sounds like a great support system! What kind of dog do you have?,false
68,Client,He's a Golden Retriever.,false
68,Therapist,"Oh, nice! And how are things going in school for you right now?",false
68,Client,They're pretty good. Grades have been pretty all right. Still like 3.7-ish.,false
68,Therapist,"Okay, great to hear that! What are your goals for after high school? Do you have any specific plans or aspirations?",false
68,Client,"Uh, I'd like to, you know, graduate high school, hopefully go to a nice Ivy League school.",false
68,Therapist,That's ambitious! But it sounds like you're really committed to making it happen. Can you tell me more about what motivates you to work so hard?,false
68,Client,Yeah.,false
68,Therapist,And what kind of changes do you think you might need to make in order to achieve those goals?,false
68,Client,"Um, I'd like to try to drink less.",false
68,Therapist,Okay. You mentioned earlier that you're concerned about the impact of drinking on your health and well-being. Can you tell me more about why that's so important to you?,false
68,Client,"It's just because I know that once I make the decision, I know I can do it. It's making the decision in the first place.",false
68,Therapist,That makes sense. So what kind of support system do you think you'll need to help you stay on track with your goals?,false
68,Client,"Um, I'm thinking of maybe trying to convince my friends without sounding dorky or something and be like, hey, you know, let's just stay in today.",false
68,Therapist,Okay. Does that sound like a plan you'd be willing to try out in the next few weeks?,false
68,Client,Yeah.,false
68,Therapist,Great! I'll make sure to schedule our next appointment for then.,false
68,Client,Perfect. Nice.,false
65,Therapist,"I sense that quitting smoking is a daunting prospect for you, and many people have shared their concerns with you about weight gain.",false
65,Client,"Many people have told me, um, if I quit smoking, I'm going to gain weight.",false
65,Therapist,That's a significant concern for you. Can you elaborate on what it means to you?,false
65,Client,"Well, food really doesn't taste good, but they say it tastes much better- if you quit smoking.",false
65,Therapist,You're worried that quitting will impact your relationship with food and make it less enjoyable.,false
65,Client,Now the downside to that is I'm gonna gain weight.,false
65,Therapist,"So, gaining weight is a major concern for you. What else comes to mind when you think about stopping smoking?",false
65,Client,"That means a new wardrobe, which I'd like to have, but I can't afford it.",false
65,Therapist,"It sounds like having a new wardrobe is something you've been wanting, but financial constraints are holding you back.",false
65,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
65,Therapist,You've been living with smoking for 18 years. Can you tell me more about how that's affected your life?,false
65,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
65,Therapist,"It seems like quitting has become a bigger part of your life because it's something you're worried will happen unexpectedly, like when you thought you'd never smoke again.",false
65,Client,Right.,false
65,Therapist,"So, the worry is that if you stop smoking, you'll gain weight and have to deal with other challenges. Can you think of anything else on this list?",false
65,Client,"Um, withdrawal.",false
65,Therapist,You're concerned about the physical discomfort of quitting.,false
65,Client,"They say it's awful. Um, being cranky.",false
65,Therapist,I can see why that would be a concern for you. What do you hope your friends will think when you quit smoking?,false
65,Client,"And if I do go through this, I just hope my friends understand and will support me in what I'm trying to do.",false
65,Therapist,It sounds like having their support is crucial for you right now.,false
65,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
65,Therapist,"So, quitting smoking means dealing with withdrawal and the unpleasantness of that. What else might be on the list?",false
65,Client,"Um, I think everything's on the bad side about smoking, but, um, I've just smoked so long. I-I just can't imagine- not going through life without smoking.",false
65,Therapist,It feels like quitting would mean giving up a part of your identity.,false
65,Client,-not- going through life without smoking.,false
65,Therapist,You're worried that you'll lose the sense of security and comfort that comes with smoking.,false
65,Client,"I know I've got to stop. Uh, I'm having no health problems from cigarettes-",false
65,Therapist,"But now that you've been informed about potential future health risks, it's making you reconsider your decision.",false
65,Client,"-at present, but when the doctor told me this morning what could be waiting for me in the future-",false
65,Therapist,The possibility of serious health consequences is weighing on you.,false
65,Client,-that made me rethink- everything.,false
65,Therapist,"It sounds like you're at a crossroads, and quitting smoking is becoming increasingly appealing.",false
86,Therapist,You're feeling overwhelmed by this situation.,false
86,Client,I just feel helpless about this whole deal.,false
86,Therapist,It sounds like you're struggling to find a way forward.,false
86,Client,Mm. I just feel helpless about this whole deal.,false
86,Therapist,You seem uncertain about where to turn next.,false
86,Client,No one wants to help me.,false
86,Therapist,"That must be really tough for you, feeling like no one is willing to support you.",false
86,Client,You feel like people aren't willing to help.,false
86,Therapist,It's understandable that you'd feel that way in this situation.,false
86,Client,No one wants to help me.,false
86,Therapist,I can see why you'd feel alone right now.,false
86,Client,Mm-hmm. I really shouldn't have done it.,false
86,Therapist,It sounds like you're reflecting on a decision that's causing you regret.,false
86,Client,Mm-hmm. I really shouldn't have done it.,false
86,Therapist,You're acknowledging that this experience has left you feeling remorseful.,false
86,Client,Mm-hmm. I couldn't help myself.,false
86,Therapist,"It seems like something just happened, and now you're dealing with the aftermath.",false
86,Client,I couldn't help myself.,false
86,Therapist,You're worried that your actions have taken control of your life in a way that's hard to manage.,false
86,Client,It's actually been a fabulous week.,false
86,Therapist,That's great to hear – it sounds like things are going well for you right now.,false
86,Client,You've really had a good week.,false
86,Therapist,"I'm glad to see that you're finding some positive aspects of your life, even in the midst of challenges.",false
86,Client,It's actually been a fabulous week.,false
86,Therapist,It seems like having supportive friends has helped you navigate this difficult time.,false
86,Client,"Mm-hmm. I know who to hang out with, I'm not stupid.",false
86,Therapist,You're recognizing that you have good judgment and can make wise decisions when it counts.,false
86,Client,"I know who to hang out with, I'm not stupid.",false
86,Therapist,Positive relationships in your life are definitely having a positive impact on you right now.,false
86,Client,Mm-hmm. I'm letting the whole family down. They had such high hopes for me.,false
86,Therapist,"It's clear that you're feeling like you've let them down, and that must be really tough for you to deal with.",false
86,Client,You feel like you're letting your family down.,false
86,Therapist,That sense of disappointment is likely weighing heavily on your heart right now.,false
86,Client,Mm-hmm. I'm letting my whole family down. They had such high hopes for me.,false
86,Therapist,It sounds like you're feeling a deep sense of regret and disappointment in yourself.,false
86,Client,Mm-hmm. This is not what I want for my life.,false
86,Therapist,"You've got your sights set on something better, and that's really admirable.",false
86,Client,This is not what I want for my life.,false
86,Therapist,You're willing to take steps towards creating a more fulfilling future for yourself.,false
86,Client,Mm-hmm. I really want to get off the program.,false
86,Therapist,It sounds like you're ready to move forward and leave this challenging experience behind.,false
86,Client,You don't want to be here.,false
86,Therapist,"However, it's clear that you're motivated to follow the rules and make progress in your recovery.",false
86,Client,"Mm-hmm. I still crave smoking, even though I've stopped.",false
86,Therapist,"It takes a lot of self-control to resist those cravings, especially when they're still present in your mind.",false
86,Client,"I still crave smoking, even though I've stopped.",false
86,Therapist,You're demonstrating remarkable strength and resilience by continuing to work towards your goals despite these challenges.,false
86,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
83,Therapist,"Welcome, Rick. It's great to have you here today.",false
83,Client,Kia ora.,false
83,Therapist,I'm glad you're taking this step towards making some changes in your life.,false
83,Client,Yeah.,false
83,Therapist,Can you tell me a bit more about where you're from originally?,false
83,Client,"I'm from down south, specifically Invercargill just short of Bluff. My family is still there.",false
83,Therapist,That's great. It sounds like your roots are important to you.,false
83,Client,"Yeah, they are.",false
83,Therapist,How long have you been living in Christchurch?,false
83,Client,I've been here since I was 18.,false
83,Therapist,"So, it's been a while. What's been the biggest challenge for you in terms of work and family life?",false
83,Client,It's just been hard to balance everything.,false
83,Therapist,I can imagine. Coming to prevention services like this can be intimidating. Can you tell me about your experience with us before?,false
83,Client,"Yeah, it was okay, but not great.",false
83,Therapist,What do you think might have made the difference if you had come back sooner?,false
83,Client,I don't know. Maybe just knowing that I needed to make a change.,false
83,Therapist,That's a good point. One thing that's helped people in the past is having a strong support system. Can you tell me about who might be able to support you on this journey?,false
83,Client,"My family, mostly. And my kids, of course.",false
83,Therapist,"Your children are very important to you, aren't they?",false
83,Client,"Yeah, they're everything to me.",false
83,Therapist,"What do you think would happen if your partner, Kirsty, knew how much this program meant to you and your kids?",false
83,Client,I hope she'd be proud of me. And that my kids would be proud too.,false
83,Therapist,That's a great goal. How might it feel for your mom to hear that you're serious about making changes for the family?,false
83,Client,I think she'd be really supportive. She'd want the best for us.,false
83,Therapist,"Your brothers and sisters could also play an important role in supporting you, right?",false
83,Client,"Yeah, they would definitely be there for me.",false
83,Therapist,How do you plan to get them on board and make sure they're supporting you throughout this process?,false
83,Client,I'm not sure. Maybe just having someone to talk to.,false
83,Therapist,"That's okay. Let's explore that further next time we meet. For now, let's focus on building your confidence in making these changes.",false
83,Client,"Yeah, that would be great.",false
83,Therapist,"It sounds like you're feeling a bit uncertain about this right now, but with the support of your whānau, I think you could make some real progress.",false
83,Client,"If they were there to support me, I'd feel much more confident.",false
83,Therapist,That's a huge step forward. Let's work on building that confidence together.,false
83,Client,"Yeah, that would be great.",false
98,Therapist,"If you don't drink, it would be a reality.",false
98,Client,I guess maybe it would probably be not a bad idea to not hang with them for a little bit.,false
98,Therapist,How important would it be for you to remain friends with them and still have your sobriety?,false
98,Client,"Well, if I need to get my license back, I think it would be pretty important for me to stop hanging around with them for a while.",false
98,Therapist,"Would that help you like get your license back, like, at this point?",false
98,Client,"Okay, good.",false
98,Therapist,"And then, um, someone to read this assessment and then, um- and then it would be up to you mostly.",false
98,Client,"Um, probably just not really drink as much. I mean, if I just didn't drink, I wouldn't have to really worry about that too much either.",false
98,Therapist,Then you wouldn't have to worry.,false
98,Client,Yeah.,false
98,Therapist,"All right. Well, thank you Mike. I appreciate this.",false
98,Client,Okay. Thank you.,false
116,Therapist,"Molly, thank you so much for taking the time to talk with me today.",false
116,Client,You're welcome.,false
116,Therapist,"I appreciate it. So, your mom had mentioned that there were some issues at school, and people were saying mean things about you. That must be really hurtful.",false
116,Client,"Yeah. I've already missed two days of school because of the bullying, and now rumors are spreading when I'm not even there.",false
116,Therapist,That's a lot to deal with. People often make up stories that aren't true.,false
116,Client,"I feel like I'm always being blamed for everything that happens. Even in fifth or sixth grade, it started happening.",false
116,Therapist,"Can you tell me more about what you mean by ""nagging on"" things? What do you think triggers this behavior?",false
116,Client,"When someone says something to me, I like to respond and keep the conversation going instead of just leaving it alone. I think some kids see me as an easy target because of this.",false
116,Therapist,"So when you're talking more, what usually happens next?",false
116,Client,"It gets bigger and bigger, and we both end up in trouble. If I stop talking, they don't know what to say, but if I keep going, it escalates.",false
116,Therapist,Okay. That must be really frustrating for you.,false
116,Client,"Yeah. Sometimes I try to tell myself to just leave it alone, but when someone says something about me, it gets me mad.",false
116,Therapist,People can be very hurtful sometimes. What do you think helps you stay calm in those situations?,false
116,Client,"Lately, I've been trying to think of my mom's feelings and what would happen if I said something like ""This is lame, leave me alone."" It seems to help me walk away.",false
116,Therapist,That's a great strategy. You're putting yourself in your mom's shoes and thinking about how she might react.,false
116,Client,Yeah. And it makes me proud of myself when I can just let things go.,false
116,Therapist,You should be proud of yourself for finding ways to manage those situations. What do you think helps you identify trustworthy friends?,false
116,Client,"For me, it's not just about how long we've known each other, but also how much they text or call me, and if they have my back in tough situations.",false
116,Therapist,That makes sense. It sounds like you're looking for people who are reliable and supportive.,false
116,Client,Yeah. And I've noticed that some friends are more drama-prone than others. They'll start rumors about me just to cause trouble.,false
116,Therapist,That can be really hurtful. What do you think would happen if you spent time with the friends who are genuinely supportive?,false
116,Client,"I already spend a lot of time with them, and they're always there for me. If I needed backup information or support, they'd definitely provide it.",false
116,Therapist,That's great to hear. It sounds like you have some good ideas about how to handle difficult situations.,false
116,Client,"Yeah. But high school can be really tough, especially when people are mean for no reason.",false
116,Therapist,I know that can be a challenge. But it's also an opportunity to learn and grow. You're doing a great job of navigating those challenges.,false
116,Client,Thanks. I've noticed that things have gotten better as the year has gone on.,false
116,Therapist,"That's wonderful to hear. And it sounds like you're finding ways to connect with people who care about you, like through swimming and other activities.",false
116,Client,Yeah. Those things help me meet new people and feel more connected.,false
116,Therapist,That's great. Is there anything else you'd like to talk about or any final thoughts?,false
116,Client,"No, I think that's it.",false
116,Therapist,"Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me today, Molly.",false
113,Therapist,"Hi, Sandra.",false
113,Client,Hi.,false
113,Therapist,Thanks for taking a few minutes to talk with me today. I appreciate your willingness to stop by despite having limited time.,false
113,Client,"Yeah, my daughter's in the hospital too, and I feel like quitting is important, but I enjoy smoking. It's hard to give it up right now because life is really chaotic.",false
113,Therapist,"So, it seems that coming here wasn't necessarily at the top of your mind when you visited your daughter with her in the hospital. Can you tell me what made it possible for you to even come in today?",false
113,Client,"I think it's because I feel like a bad role model for my kids, and now some of their friends are smoking, so I don't want them to think it's okay.",false
113,Therapist,"You're concerned about setting a good example for your children. That's understandable, especially with your daughter turning 12 and already seeing her friends smoke.",false
113,Client,"Yeah, that's true. I smoked when I was young, and I don't want my kids to start smoking too.",false
113,Therapist,It sounds like you're worried about being a bad parent and setting an example for your children. You mentioned earlier that you're not ready to quit smoking immediately.,false
113,Client,That's right. It seems so hard to give up now.,false
113,Therapist,Can you tell me what you enjoy most about smoking? What makes it appealing to you?,false
113,Client,"It's very enjoyable, relaxing, and a stress reliever. I like having a cigarette after meals because it helps me feel full and in control of my weight.",false
113,Therapist,You mentioned that smoking is a way for you to relax and manage your weight. Is there anything else you enjoy about it?,false
113,Client,"Hmm...I just really enjoy it, I guess. It's not good for me, but I'm so used to smoking that I don't think much about quitting.",false
113,Therapist,"So, let me make sure I understand what you like about smoking. You mentioned relaxation, socializing with friends from work, and managing your weight. Is there anything else?",false
113,Client,Yeah...I just enjoy it a lot.,false
113,Therapist,"It sounds like smoking is an important part of your life, something you've done for a long time and find hard to imagine giving up.",false
113,Client,Exactly.,false
113,Therapist,Can you tell me about some of the not-so-good things about smoking? What are you worried about?,false
113,Client,"I'm worried about my kids. I feel like I'm being a bad parent, and sometimes they've seen me smoke for years.",false
113,Therapist,You're concerned that your children will think it's okay to smoke because they've seen you do it before.,false
113,Client,Yeah...and some of their friends are already smoking.,false
113,Therapist,Did something specific happen recently that made you realize how much your daughter is watching and learning from you?,false
113,Client,"This morning, I was outside having a cigarette, and then she looked out the window watching me smoke.",false
113,Therapist,That must have been really uncomfortable for you. How did it feel when you saw her looking at you like that?,false
113,Client,"I felt terrible...I want to be a good parent, but this isn't part of my plan.",false
113,Therapist,"It's clear that being a good parent is very important to you, and you're struggling with how your smoking habits fit into that.",false
113,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
113,Therapist,Can you help me understand why it seems like there's a disconnect between wanting to be a good parent and enjoying smoking?,false
113,Client,I guess it doesn't make sense. Smoking is the opposite of what I want for my kids.,false
113,Therapist,"So, quitting or changing your smoking habits would need to become more important to you than they are now.",false
113,Client,I'm not sure what that would take...I don't have any plans to quit right now.,false
113,Therapist,It's not that you don't want to quit; it's just that you're not sure how to make it a priority for yourself.,false
113,Client,Exactly.,false
113,Therapist,"Okay, let's summarize. You mentioned some of the good things about smoking, like relaxation and socializing with friends from work. Can you tell me what might need to change for quitting or changing your smoking habits to become more important?",false
113,Client,I'm not sure...I just know it would be hard.,false
113,Therapist,We've probably used up our time today. Would you be willing to schedule another appointment and talk more about this next week?,false
113,Client,"Yeah, that sounds good.",false
113,Therapist,"Great. Before we go, can you do a little homework between now and then? Write down your top three reasons for quitting smoking and reflect on the good things as well as some of the less good things.",false
113,Client,"Okay, I'll try.",false
113,Therapist,Thanks for being willing to do that. We'll see you next week.,false
113,Client,All right.,false
125,Therapist,"So, it sounds like you're feeling really drained from a sleepless night with your baby.",false
125,Client,"Yes. She was up every three hours to eat, I don't understand it.",false
125,Therapist,"It can be overwhelming when a baby's needs are so frequent and unpredictable, especially at six weeks old.",false
125,Client,"Yes. My mom told me that I started sleeping through the night when I was a month old, Lilly is six weeks.",false
125,Therapist,That suggests you were expecting Lilly to have established a more regular sleep pattern by now.,false
125,Client,"Well, what is normal for a baby this age?",false
122,Therapist,Can you tell me a bit more about why you're here today?,false
122,Client,"Well, my mom wants me to be here.",false
122,Therapist,I sense some resistance in your words. What's going on that makes you feel like you don't want to be here?,false
122,Client,"I don't really wanna be here, but it-it-- whatever.",false
122,Therapist,It sounds like there's a bit of frustration or anxiety that's driving your feelings about being here. Can you help me understand what's causing that?,false
122,Client,"Um, she-she found my stash-",false
122,Therapist,You're feeling pretty upset right now because of something your mom discovered in your stuff.,false
122,Client,"-and she freaked out, and she's going crazy over it. Um, I don't why she was going through stuff in the first place, but whatever, so, now I'm here.",false
122,Therapist,It seems like your mom's actions have led to a big reaction from you. Can you tell me more about what happened when she found that stash?,false
122,Client,"Um, I've been hanging out with a new cool crowd of people that I really like.",false
122,Therapist,You're feeling pretty good about this new group and the connections you're making with them.,false
122,Client,"Uh, a-and-and that's-that's basically it.",false
122,Therapist,It sounds like there are some positive changes happening in your life right now. Can you help me understand what's going on from your mom's perspective?,false
122,Client,"Uh, a-and-and that's-that's basically it.",false
122,Therapist,You're feeling pretty overwhelmed by the situation with your mom and the discovery of your stash. It's understandable to feel that way.,false
122,Therapist,Can you tell me more about what's going through your mind when you think about your mom's actions?,false
122,Therapist,You're feeling pretty upset with your mom for doing something that feels like an invasion of your personal space. That must be really tough for you.,false
122,Therapist,It sounds like you're feeling a bit hurt and frustrated by your mom's actions. Can we explore what might have led her to do that?,false
122,Therapist,You feel like your mom overstepped boundaries by going through your belongings without asking.,false
122,Therapist,"It's understandable that you wouldn't want someone to do the same thing to you, especially when it comes to your personal belongings.",false
122,Therapist,You're feeling pretty protective of your own space and boundaries right now.,false
