3,Client,"Well, my wife has been urging me a lot lately to improve my health habits. I'm not sure what the issue is because I've been working really hard. Sometimes I can't make it home for dinner and end up eating out at places like Applebee's. But she seems more concerned than I am—I just don't see why there's such a fuss.",false
3,Therapist,"It sounds like you're feeling that your health isn't something to worry about right now, is that correct?",false
3,Client,"Yes, I feel fine.",false
3,Therapist,Understood.,false
3,Client,"My job involves a lot of manual labor, so I'm usually working outside in the heat and sweating it all out. That helps me deal with anything unhealthy I might consume.",false
3,Therapist,Have you noticed any changes in your weight or anything similar?,false
3,Client,"A little bit, but nothing significant. I don't feel bloated at all.",false
3,Therapist,Got it. And have you had a recent check-up with your doctor?,false
3,Client,"Yes, I went for a physical last year and everything was fine.",false
3,Therapist,"So, you're feeling good overall?",false
3,Client,"Yes, I am.",false
3,Therapist,It seems like you think your wife might be more concerned than necessary about this situation. Is that right?,false
3,Client,"Not exactly overreacting—I know she cares and wants me to live a long, healthy life. But sometimes, especially with a demanding job, eating out can feel comforting.",false
3,Therapist,"I understand. If it's okay with you, I'd like to share some information about obesity or diabetes, just in case you're interested.",false
3,Client,Sure. [unintelligible 00:01:33],false
3,Therapist,"Great, thank you.",false
12,Therapist,"Sarah, I'm glad you came for your well-woman exam today. We've covered a lot of ground regarding your concerns. May we discuss your smoking habits further?",false
12,Client,"Sure, that's fine.",false
12,Therapist,Could you tell me more about how often you smoke in a day? You mentioned it has increased from once or twice daily.,false
12,Client,"Yeah, typically I smoke once in the morning, once during lunch, and then maybe five or six times in the evening.",false
12,Therapist,So that's around eight cigarettes per day. Would that be just under half a pack?,false
12,Client,"Yes, that sounds about right.",false
12,Therapist,Over what period has this increase occurred?,false
12,Client,"Honestly, it's probably been over the past year that I've started smoking more.",false
12,Therapist,"So your smoking has increased over the last year, particularly in the evening?",false
12,Client,"Yeah. Since my two-year-old son is around, I try to avoid smoking when he's awake and usually wait until he goes to bed.",false
12,Therapist,That makes sense; it seems like a time for you to relax and unwind.,false
12,Therapist,Exactly. With your busy schedule—working full-time and attending night classes—I understand why the evening feels like a personal time for relaxation.,false
12,Therapist,"Of course, that's an important time for you given everything on your plate.",false
12,Client,"Yes, it is.",false
12,Therapist,What other activities do you engage in during the evenings to relax?,false
12,Client,Sometimes I might have one or two drinks.,false
12,Therapist,One or two drinks. How many would you typically have over a week?,false
12,Client,"I'm not sure why we're discussing this; I thought today was just for my regular check-up, and I don't see myself as someone who needs to talk about drinking.",false
12,Therapist,"I understand, Sarah. My intention isn't to dictate your choices but rather to share information that might be helpful given your busy life as a mother, worker, and student. Our healthcare team wants to ensure you have the resources needed for your health goals. Would it be okay if we discuss some health concerns related to smoking and alcohol?",false
12,Client,"Okay, I suppose.",false
12,Therapist,"We know increased smoking and drinking can be linked to various cancers—like colon, cervical, breast, lung, and pancreatic cancer—as well as liver, lung diseases, heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension. It's a lot of information, but I'm interested in hearing your thoughts on this.",false
12,Client,"Well, I don't smoke or drink that much compared to others at work. I've been trying to keep it low.",false
12,Therapist,So you're making an effort to reduce your intake?,false
12,Client,"Yes, I am.",false
12,Therapist,"Here's a readiness ruler in my pocket; 0 means not ready to quit smoking at all, and 10 means completely ready. Where do you see yourself on this scale?",false
12,Client,Maybe around five.,false
12,Therapist,About halfway there. What makes you choose five instead of four?,false
12,Client,"The risks you mentioned, like cancer, are concerning, especially as a mother. I don't want anything to happen to me.",false
12,Therapist,"That's understandable. Considering these health concerns and your family worries, where do you stand in thinking about making changes? What steps might move you closer to a 10?",false
12,Client,Perhaps I could try cutting back on smoking in the evenings a bit.,false
12,Therapist,Great idea. How many cigarettes would that be?,false
12,Client,"If I'm currently smoking five or six in the evening, maybe three plus what I smoke during the day.",false
12,Therapist,"That's quite a reduction. Since our time is limited today, would you consider coming back in about four weeks to review this plan?",false
12,Client,"Sure, that works for me.",false
12,Therapist,Excellent. We can discuss your lab results and your progress then. Would you like some information on smoking cessation?,false
12,Client,"Yes, I think that would be helpful.",false
12,Therapist,"Here's a brochure with useful distraction techniques for nicotine cravings—it has helped other patients before. Additionally, would you consider meeting one of our counselors?",false
12,Client,What exactly would they discuss?,false
12,Therapist,"Dr. Kirtley specializes in the relationship between alcohol and stress. The National Guidelines suggest women should have no more than seven drinks per week to minimize health risks. Since your drinking is a bit higher, it might be beneficial to talk with him.",false
12,Client,"I'm open to discussing my stress, but I'm still unsure about addressing my drinking habits.",false
12,Therapist,"That's perfectly fine. I'm glad you're willing to speak with Dr. Kirtley. Before you leave today, we'll arrange your follow-up appointment and a session with Dr. Kirtley at the scheduler’s desk. Do you have any other questions for me?",false
12,Client,"No, I think that covers everything.",false
12,Therapist,"Wonderful. It was nice meeting you, Sarah. See you in a month.",false
12,Client,Okay.,false
6,Therapist,"Hi, Sal. Thank you for joining me today.",false
6,Client,No problem at all.,false
6,Therapist,"I noticed your doctor referred you here, and I truly appreciate your effort in making this appointment.",false
6,Client,"Yeah, it's a bit inconvenient, but I'm here nonetheless.",false
6,Therapist,You made the effort to come—do you have an understanding of what concerns led your doctor to refer you?,false
6,Client,"Something about needing more changes. The smoking has changed, and now there’s talk about reducing drinking, getting rid of extra cigarettes, and even my dog. I’m not sure what else is expected.",false
6,Therapist,So it seems like your asthma issues are part of a broader set of challenges?,false
6,Client,"Yes, there's also a lot of stress. My wife is on unpaid maternity leave with the baby, so I'm the sole earner. Plus, I need to make these life changes.",false
6,Therapist,It sounds like you're dealing with quite a bit right now.,false
6,Client,"Absolutely, it feels overwhelming.",false
6,Therapist,We have about 15 or 20 minutes together. Would it be alright if we took some time to explore the various challenges you’re facing and identify what might be most helpful for us to focus on?,false
6,Client,"Sure, everything seems scattered, but I guess we need a starting point.",false
6,Therapist,"One tool we use is an agenda-setting worksheet. If you could list all the changes others suggest or expect from you, what would they include? Remember, Sal, just because we write them down doesn’t mean you have to change anything—you’re in control here.",false
6,Client,Okay.,false
6,Therapist,It's simply a way to lay everything out on the table.,false
6,Client,Alright. As long as I'm not committing to changes and it’s more about listing things—like putting pen to paper.,false
6,Therapist,Exactly.,false
6,Client,"So, my asthma is one issue.",false
6,Therapist,"Got it, asthma is one concern. What else?",false
6,Client,"They also want me to get rid of Oscar, my dog.",false
6,Therapist,Your doctor mentioned your dog as—,false
6,Client,"Yes, they say he's a major contributor to my asthma issues. I don't agree with that and can’t just give him up, but it’s something on the table.",false
6,Therapist,That must be quite shocking to hear you need to part with your dog.,false
6,Client,Definitely. He’s been in my life longer than my wife has.,false
6,Therapist,Hmm. So this is causing significant stress for you?,false
6,Client,"Yes, he's like a best friend and very important to me. Also, I'm trying to quit smoking completely.",false
6,Therapist,So quitting smoking is another goal of yours?,false
6,Client,Finances are also a concern right now.,false
6,Therapist,"Okay, so money issues as well.",false
6,Client,"And time management—I have all these appointments and need to take time off work, which affects my finances too.",false
6,Therapist,Right. The financial aspect ties into the time you spend on appointments.,false
6,Client,Exactly. There’s a lot happening. I also need to reduce my drinking.,false
6,Therapist,"Wow, that's quite a bit going on right now, Sal. Is there anything else troubling you?",false
6,Client,"No, it just feels overwhelming when you see everything laid out like this.",false
6,Therapist,"Understandable. If you had to choose one or two high-priority areas to discuss today, where would you start?",false
6,Client,"The situation with my dog has been particularly distressing, and my asthma is also unmanageable. Maybe we can focus on those first.",false
6,Therapist,"Okay, it seems these issues are interconnected.",false
6,Client,"Yes, they are related in some ways.",false
24,Therapist,"Hello, how can I assist you today?",false
24,Client,"Yes, hopefully. Um, my workplace has just implemented a smoke-free policy. I'm not thrilled about it. I plan to continue smoking and was wondering if there's anything that could help me manage the day better. It's like going out for a beer and smoking after work.",false
24,Therapist,"So your workplace has become smoke-free, and you're feeling quite unhappy about it?",false
24,Client,"Yes, I don't intend to quit smoking. I enjoy it because it helps me relax. Honestly, I don’t see why there’s such an issue with it.",false
24,Therapist,Could you share a bit more about how smoking fits into your daily routine? It might help us explore some options—,false
24,Client,"Well, I smoke just under a pack each day. It's manageable for me. I've been smoking for the past five years, and while I could quit if I wanted to, I'm not interested in doing so right now.",false
24,Therapist,"So it sounds like smoking is an important part of your life at this moment, and you're not ready to change that habit. However, you feel confident that you could quit if the decision came up?",false
24,Client,"Yes, I believe I can quit.",false
24,Therapist,What gives you such confidence in quitting?,false
24,Client,"Well, I don't see why I couldn’t, although I've never tried before. It's just something I do for enjoyment, like during breaks at work or after finishing my day.",false
24,Therapist,"And regarding your readiness to actually make a quit attempt, where would you place yourself on a scale from 1 to 10? One being not considering it at all and ten being fully ready and wanting to quit?",false
24,Client,"I’d say about a two. I haven’t really thought about quitting until this new policy was announced today, so I’m definitely not planning to stop smoking.",false
24,Therapist,What made you choose two instead of one?,false
24,Client,"Well, anything's possible, right? I suppose there’s a chance I could be persuaded. Are there things I can try that might make me want to quit smoking?",false
24,Therapist,"There are several products available now that can help reduce the urge to smoke. We have options that replace nicotine and decrease withdrawal symptoms when you cut down or quit, as well as medications your doctor could prescribe to lessen the desire to smoke.",false
24,Client,"That’s good to know. I’m not planning on doing anything today, but it's helpful to understand my options. If I decided to quit, at least I have some tools that might help me.",false
24,Therapist,"Absolutely. Considering you mentioned a two on the scale, what do you think would be needed for you to move up to a four or five?",false
24,Client,"I’m not sure. Maybe if one of my friends decided to quit with me, it could help. But all my friends enjoy smoking too, so that doesn’t seem likely soon.",false
24,Therapist,It’s interesting to consider whether some colleagues at work might also be planning to quit now that the workplace is smoke-free.,false
24,Client,"That's a good point. I hadn't thought about that. Yes, it could be helpful.",false
24,Therapist,It seems like you're here primarily for information today. I'm glad to help you explore these options when and if you decide it’s time for you.,false
24,Client,"Okay, thank you very much.",false
21,Therapist,"Hello, Laura.",false
21,Client,Hi.,false
21,Therapist,"Thank you for joining me today. I'm curious if you're familiar with what we'll be discussing here. If it's alright, I'd like to give you a brief overview of our session.",false
21,Client,Sure.,false
21,Therapist,"Essentially, we'll spend some time talking about your life goals and getting to know you better. We'll also discuss any behaviors you might want to explore changing. My role isn't to judge or change you but rather to understand how things are going for you, identify any changes you'd like to make, and see how I can support you in achieving what's most beneficial for you.",false
21,Client,Okay.,false
21,Therapist,Does that sound good?,false
21,Client,Yes.,false
21,Therapist,"Great. To start off, could you tell me a bit about yourself?",false
21,Client,My name is Laura. I'm 17 years old and a senior in high school.,false
21,Therapist,Thank you for sharing. What are your plans or goals for the future?,false
21,Client,Hopefully to attend college and maintain good grades to get accepted.,false
21,Therapist,"That sounds wonderful. Do you have any specific colleges in mind, perhaps locally or out of state?",false
21,Client,"I'm not certain yet, but I'm considering a few local schools and possibly applying to some out-of-state ones as well.",false
21,Therapist,Interesting. So you're keeping your options open. What about your field of study—are there any particular areas you're interested in pursuing?,false
21,Client,Maybe pre-law.,false
21,Therapist,"That's exciting! What do you enjoy doing for fun, Laura?",false
21,Client,"On weekends, I like to hang out with friends, go to parties or the mall, and attend school events like football games.",false
21,Therapist,It sounds like you have a good time. Would you say you have many friends or just a few close ones?,false
21,Client,"Probably a moderate number—I'm not particularly popular, but I'm also not friendless.",false
21,Therapist,"That's perfectly fine. Being ""normal"" is great too! How are your grades currently?",false
21,Client,They're pretty good—mostly As and Bs.,false
21,Therapist,"Excellent. Now, different people value different things in life, like family or friendships. Here’s a list of values such as belonging, community, cultural identity, family, friendship, modesty, religion, respect, self-determination, and spirituality. Which ones resonate with you?",false
21,Client,"Family is definitely important to me, along with friendship and belonging.",false
21,Therapist,That makes sense. Can you tell me more about why your family is so significant to you?,false
21,Client,"I love them deeply and want them to think well of me, as well as feel accepting and loving towards me.",false
21,Therapist,Do you have any siblings?,false
21,Client,"Yes, I have one sister.",false
21,Therapist,Great. And what makes friendship important for you?,false
21,Client,"I've grown close to many people whom I care about, so being accepted by them is important too.",false
21,Therapist,So having good friends and being a good friend yourself matters a lot. What about belonging—why do you find that significant?,false
21,Client,It's about fitting in and feeling generally accepted.,false
21,Therapist,"You want to feel part of a group. Let’s talk about your social life a bit more. When you go out with friends, especially at parties, do you ever drink alcohol?",false
21,Client,Not much—maybe one or two drinks at most.,false
21,Therapist,Could you elaborate on how alcohol fits into your social interactions?,false
21,Client,"I usually have a drink just to appear like I'm drinking, so people don't pressure me about it.",false
21,Therapist,"So there's some peer pressure involved, and having a drink makes things easier for you. How often do these situations occur—like one or two weekends a month?",false
21,Client,"Yes, that sounds right.",false
21,Therapist,And what kind of settings are these usually in?,false
21,Client,Typically at parties or small gatherings where there might be some alcohol around.,false
21,Therapist,"So it's mostly about hanging out with friends. Are these places where parents are present, or is it just among peers?",false
21,Client,"Mostly just us kids, but sometimes I'm at a friend’s house where their family is also around.",false
21,Therapist,And what about driving after drinking—do you ever find yourself in that situation?,false
21,Client,"No, I've never driven drunk nor been with someone who was. It's too dangerous.",false
21,Therapist,That's very wise of you. What do you know about the dangers of drunk driving?,false
21,Client,"Alcohol impairs judgment and can lead to accidents, so it’s best avoided.",false
21,Therapist,"You're being very cautious, which is commendable. Can you tell me how many drinks you've had in one day at most?",false
21,Client,Not more than two.,false
21,Therapist,What do you like about alcohol when you do have it?,false
21,Client,"I haven't been drunk enough to know if I enjoy that feeling, but it does make people feel relaxed and good.",false
21,Therapist,So it helps with relaxation. Are there any downsides to drinking for you?,false
21,Client,"Yes, at parties, some people drink too much and end up throwing up or acting obnoxiously, which isn't fun.",false
21,Therapist,You've seen the negative consequences others face. How does alcohol fit into your life considering it's illegal for someone under 21?,false
21,Client,"It is risky, but many still do it.",false
21,Therapist,"Given that you value family and friendships, how does alcohol play a role in these areas of your life?",false
21,Client,"My parents don't approve of drinking, so it doesn’t fit with my family. But among friends at parties, alcohol is usually present.",false
21,Therapist,"So from your family's perspective, drinking isn't aligned with their values. With friends, do you feel like it helps you connect or have fun?",false
21,Client,It seems to be part of the social scene and fits with feeling a sense of belonging.,false
21,Therapist,"Looking ahead 5 to 10 years, how do you see alcohol fitting into your life then?",false
21,Client,I think its role will diminish significantly as I focus on my future goals like college and law school.,false
21,Therapist,So drinking might interfere with reaching those goals. How often do you imagine yourself drinking when you're in college?,false
21,Client,Probably even less than now—maybe just one drink occasionally.,false
21,Therapist,"It sounds like you have a plan to reduce your drinking over time. How important is it for you to make these adjustments, on a scale from 1 to 10?",false
21,Client,Maybe around five or six.,false
21,Therapist,Why did you choose that number instead of lower?,false
21,Client,"Because while it's not something I'm constantly thinking about changing, it’s still significant enough to consider.",false
21,Therapist,And how confident are you in your ability to make these changes if you decide to do so?,false
21,Client,Quite confident—I’m not really into drinking much anyway.,false
21,Therapist,"On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your confidence in being able to quit or reduce drinking?",false
21,Client,Probably an eight or nine because it's not a major part of my life.,false
21,Therapist,It sounds like you have a plan to adjust your drinking habits and that it’s moderately important for you. What goal could we set for today?,false
21,Client,I might try not having any drinks at the next party I attend.,false
21,Therapist,Do you feel confident about stopping completely at the next gathering?,false
21,Client,"Yes, my friends aren't pressuring me much, so I can just say no to a drink if needed.",false
21,Therapist,What benefits do you anticipate from achieving this goal?,false
21,Client,"I'll be more aware and alert, and it's better for my health since alcohol isn’t good for you.",false
21,Therapist,It seems like you're comfortable with the idea of not drinking at your next party. Would it be okay if we meet again to check on how things are going?,false
21,Client,"Yes, that would be fine.",false
21,Therapist,Great. Some benefits you mentioned include health improvements and better focus on academic goals. Is there anything else important for me to know?,false
21,Client,How can I encourage my friends to stop drinking?,false
21,Therapist,"That's a great question. It can be challenging if your friends continue drinking, so one strategy is to engage in more activities that don't involve alcohol. If you're at a party, carrying an empty drink or something non-alcoholic might help deter others from offering you drinks. How do these suggestions sound?",false
21,Client,That sounds helpful.,false
21,Therapist,And how about discussing your decision with your friends—have you thought about how to approach them?,false
21,Client,I plan on just telling them that I don't want to drink anymore.,false
21,Therapist,It seems like your closest friends would be supportive of this. Do you have any other concerns or questions for me today?,false
21,Client,"No, I think I'm good.",false
21,Therapist,"Alright. Let's aim to meet in a few weeks to see how things are progressing. If everything is going well, that’s great; if not, we can work through any challenges together. Does that sound okay?",false
21,Client,"Yes, thank you.",false
21,Therapist,You're welcome. I look forward to our next meeting.,false
21,Client,Thank you too.,false
27,Therapist,I hear that your asthma symptoms have been quite overwhelming. Let's explore some strategies to help you regain control and avoid needing further visits.,false
27,Client,"Yes, absolutely. I definitely don't want to come back here. But the doctor mentioned Oscar, my dog, is linked to my asthma issues. However—",false
27,Therapist,I see.,false
27,Client,—the strange thing is that he's been with me for 12 years without any problems until now.,false
27,Therapist,"It sounds like this news was unexpected for you. You must have seen the clinic materials about managing asthma and how pets can contribute to symptoms, right?",false
27,Client,"Yes, but I—let me clarify—I've reviewed those materials; I even read them. My main action has been taking my medication. So, I'm not very knowledgeable on this topic.",false
27,Therapist,"Hold on a moment, Sal. When you say you're uninformed, do you mean that despite knowing the importance of being informed—especially since your chart indicates you have a young baby—",false
27,Client,Yes.,false
27,Therapist,—a new addition to your family—and considering how much you care about staying healthy for them and having already made significant changes like nearly quitting smoking—,false
27,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
27,Therapist,"—the next step is addressing the situation with Oscar. I know it's challenging, but there are always people willing to adopt pets. Perhaps friends or family could help?",false
27,Client,This feels overwhelming right now. John Carlo is taken care of; he doesn't have asthma from the dog. It’s just me who—,false
27,Therapist,"My concern is for you, Sal. Your symptoms have worsened significantly, and you've experienced several severe asthma attacks. Do you realize that this poses a serious risk to your life? Some adults with severe asthma can face fatal outcomes due to their condition. This is something we must take very seriously.",false
27,Client,"So, Oscar could be the cause of my death? He hasn't caused any issues in 12 years, and the doctor suggests it might be stress or other factors. Why are we now saying Oscar could be life-threatening?",false
27,Therapist,"Sal, you understand that your asthma has been progressively worsening over time. The increasing strength of your medication indicates this progression. There's a limit to what medication can achieve alone.",false
27,Client,"They can continue prescribing stronger medications and give me the most potent one, but I'll keep Oscar.",false
27,Therapist,"You're nearing the strongest medication available. If Oscar is that important to you, do you value him more than your baby or wife? That doesn't make sense to me. Do you grasp how crucial this situation is?",false
27,Client,"I understand, but it seems like you don’t fully comprehend my circumstances. I've had Oscar for 12 years; I can't just remove him from my home without certainty that he's the main issue.",false
27,Therapist,"Okay, let’s see what we can do next.",false
33,Therapist,"Alright, David. How are you feeling after that rinse?",false
33,Client,I'm feeling pretty good.,false
33,Therapist,Would you like to take a look at how it turned out?,false
33,Client,"Sure, let's check it out.",false
33,Therapist,What do you think of the results?,false
33,Client,That looks really well done.,false
33,Therapist,"Yes, indeed.",false
33,Client,You managed to get rid of that unsightly discoloration.,false
33,Therapist,Absolutely. I noticed quite a bit of staining earlier. Do you have any thoughts on what might be causing it?,false
33,Client,"Well, the usual culprits like smoking, wine, and coffee are probably to blame.",false
33,Therapist,Have you considered quitting smoking at this time?,false
33,Client,"Yes, I've thought about it. It's just not something that comes easily for me—I've tried before without success. Everyone keeps telling me to quit.",false
33,Therapist,"So, here I am as another person advising you to quit smoking, David.",false
33,Client,"Yeah, yeah, I know. [unintelligible 00:01:13] Hmm.",false
33,Therapist,I apologize if it seems like I'm just adding to the chorus of voices telling you to quit.,false
33,Client,"I understand that smokers often hear ""How can you smoke today?"" [coughs] It's not easy to quit, though.",false
33,Therapist,If quitting were as simple as some people suggest—,false
33,Client,Yeah.,false
33,Therapist,—like your doctor or partner says—,false
33,Client,"Well, who wouldn't want to quit if it was that straightforward?",false
33,Therapist,"Yes, it would be hard to ignore such advice.",false
33,Client,I just hear it every day.,false
33,Therapist,Can you share a bit about your history with smoking? How long have you smoked and what role does it play in your life?,false
33,Client,"I've been smoking for 40 years since I was 14. I quit a few times in my 20s, but it's been consistent ever since. Changing now seems unlikely.",false
33,Therapist,It sounds like you've tried many methods without success.,false
33,Client,Nothing has worked for me.,false
33,Therapist,"Yes, that must be frustrating.",false
33,Client,I know cold turkey is probably the only way to quit for most people who've done it. My group did it that way—,false
33,Therapist,Mm-hmm.,false
33,Client,"—but they struggled with it. It's my choice, and I don't appreciate lectures about it.",false
33,Therapist,"Yes, it truly is your decision. Nobody has the right to dictate what you should do. If there were a situation where you decided to quit, what would that look like?",false
33,Client,That's hard to say because even open-heart surgery didn't make me quit. Prostate cancer didn't either. I just don't feel motivated.,false
33,Therapist,So this is something you see yourself doing in the future?,false
33,Client,"Yes, it will take a while, quite a while.",false
33,Therapist,"Thank you for sharing that with me. Right now, quitting isn't on your agenda, but would it be okay if we revisit this topic next time? I understand you don't want lectures, yet I am concerned about your health.",false
33,Client,"Sure, I'm open to listening as long as there's no lengthy lecture.",false
33,Therapist,As long as I keep it brief?,false
33,Client,[laughs] Yes.,false
33,Therapist,Okay. [chuckles],false
33,Client,My surgeon once asked why he should continue treating me.,false
33,Therapist,Hmm.,false
33,Client,"He’s a great doctor, though. [laughs]",false
33,Therapist,[chuckles] So you're glad to keep him as your doctor?,false
33,Client,Yes.,false
33,Therapist,"David, wherever you are in this process, we'll work with it.",false
33,Client,Okay.,false
33,Therapist,Thank you for taking the time to talk about smoking today.,false
33,Client,"Thanks, doc.",false
33,Therapist,Alright.,false
33,Client,Okay.,false
36,Therapist,Barbara Roberts?,false
36,Client,Yes. Good morning.,false
36,Therapist,"Hello, there.",false
36,Client,Hello.,false
36,Therapist,"I'm Dr. Betty, one of the new GPs here. May I know how you'd like me to address you?",false
36,Client,You can call me Barbara. That's fine with me. Thank you.,false
36,Therapist,"Alright, that works for me. So, Barbara, it seems Dr. Brown usually sees you—is that correct?",false
36,Client,"Yes, Dr. Brown is my doctor.",false
36,Therapist,Understood. What brings you to see me today?,false
36,Client,"I'm here about a stomach issue. It's been troublesome, and Dr. Brown hasn't found the cause yet. I thought maybe you could offer some help.",false
36,Therapist,Alright. Could you tell me more about your stomach issues?,false
36,Client,"Sure. I experience discomfort almost all the time, often feeling bloated. My symptoms vary between constipation and diarrhea, with cramping or sharp pains at times. There's also a frequent urge to use the bathroom, accompanied by smelly gas.",false
36,Therapist,It sounds like you're dealing with quite a few challenging symptoms.,false
36,Client,Yes.,false
36,Therapist,How long have these issues been occurring?,false
36,Client,I think it started about four years ago after a holiday in Egypt where I had severe sickness and diarrhea. My stomach hasn't felt right since then.,false
36,Therapist,So you believe the problem began around four years ago following that trip?,false
36,Client,"Yes, that's correct.",false
36,Therapist,What treatments have you tried so far?,false
36,Client,"Dr. Brown initially prescribed muscle relaxants. I've also visited a health shop where they provided various tablets and medicines, including Immodium, which I always carry with me.",false
36,Therapist,And how do you decide when to take these different remedies from the herbal shop?,false
36,Client,"Well, since my symptoms vary daily, I choose specific tablets based on what's bothering me at the time.",false
36,Therapist,So it sounds like you're selecting treatments day by day depending on your symptoms. Is that right?,false
36,Client,Yes.,false
36,Therapist,Have any tests been conducted for these issues?,false
36,Client,"Yes, initially I had a gastroscopy and a barium enema, but Dr. Brown hasn't pursued further testing since they found nothing.",false
36,Therapist,It seems you're not satisfied with the lack of additional tests.,false
36,Client,"Well, it feels like the NHS might be cutting costs, so he's decided I've had enough tests.",false
36,Therapist,So you feel that more tests could have been done if resources allowed?,false
36,Client,"Yes, there are many tests available online that he hasn't considered. If I had more money, I'd go private.",false
36,Therapist,It sounds like you believe not enough testing has been done. Is that correct?,false
36,Client,Exactly. There's a lot more that could be explored.,false
36,Therapist,"So, to summarize, these stomach problems have persisted for about four years with various symptoms and treatments tried, but you feel the investigations haven't been thorough enough. Is that right?",false
36,Client,"Yes, that's accurate.",false
36,Therapist,How has this situation impacted your daily life?,false
36,Client,"It's had a significant impact. I've reduced my work hours because sitting all day became uncomfortable, and eventually stopped working altogether about a year ago. I miss socializing with colleagues and friends.",false
36,Therapist,It sounds like these symptoms have led to some major lifestyle changes for you.,false
36,Client,"Yes, they really have.",false
36,Therapist,What do your days typically look like now?,false
36,Client,"I mostly stay at home, doing household chores and watching a lot of daytime TV. Sometimes I read magazines, but generally, I'm just at home.",false
36,Therapist,Have there been any periods when your symptoms improved noticeably?,false
36,Client,"Last year, during my son's wedding preparations, I felt surprisingly well despite initial worries about managing it all.",false
36,Therapist,How were your stomach symptoms then?,false
36,Client,They hardly bothered me. It was a good time for me.,false
36,Therapist,Are there times when the symptoms seem worse or more bothersome?,false
36,Client,"Currently, I'm in a rough patch with increased discomfort. It's particularly bad when my husband is away due to his job.",false
36,Therapist,So you notice your symptoms worsen when he's not around. Is that correct?,false
36,Client,"Yes, maybe because I focus on them more when he's gone.",false
36,Therapist,You've been consulting Dr. Brown for a few years now. What has he suggested might be the issue?,false
36,Client,He thinks it's stress-related and all in my head.,false
36,Therapist,And what are your thoughts on that?,false
36,Client,I don't believe it can all be psychological because of the physical pain I experience.,false
36,Therapist,Have you considered any possible causes yourself?,false
36,Client,"Initially, I thought it might have been an unresolved infection. Sometimes I wonder if it could be IBS or even an ulcer. On bad days, I worry about cancer due to my mother-in-law's experience with a late-diagnosed growth.",false
36,Therapist,So you're concerned there might be something serious like cancer?,false
36,Client,"Yes, and at night, I often check for any changes in my stomach area just to be sure.",false
36,Therapist,"To ensure we understand correctly, you've seen Dr. Brown for several years, tried various medications with little success, undergone some tests but feel they were insufficient, and sometimes worry about the possibility of cancer. Is that right?",false
36,Client,"Yes, that's correct.",false
36,Therapist,What are your hopes for today's visit with me?,false
36,Client,I thought you might suggest new tests or treatments since you've just completed your medical training.,false
36,Therapist,You were hoping I'd recommend additional tests?,false
36,Client,Yes. There must be something a test could reveal.,false
36,Therapist,"Barbara, after hearing your story and symptoms, I'm not convinced that more tests would be beneficial at this point. The main investigations have already been done without significant findings, so it's unlikely they would show anything new now. It might be a waste of time to pursue further testing.",false
36,Client,So do you think it's all in my head like Dr. Brown suggests?,false
36,Therapist,"No, I don't believe that at all. You clearly experience real pain and physical symptoms that significantly affect your life.",false
36,Therapist,"Sometimes these issues aren't just mental or physical; they can be interconnected. For instance, you mentioned feeling better during busy times, like your son's wedding, and worse when your husband is away. Could there be a connection between your emotional state, life circumstances, and how much your symptoms bother you?",false
36,Client,I don't see my mind causing this level of pain.,false
36,Therapist,"I'm not suggesting the pain is in your mind. Rather, our emotions and life situations can influence how we perceive physical symptoms. Since medications and tests haven't helped much, perhaps it's time to explore a different approach.",false
36,Client,What kind of approach are you thinking about?,false
36,Therapist,"Considering that your lifestyle has changed significantly over the past four years, with fewer enjoyable activities, I'm wondering if this might be affecting how you feel. Perhaps reintroducing some pleasurable activities could improve your overall well-being and even alleviate some symptoms.",false
36,Client,I just can't do those things anymore.,false
36,Therapist,"It seems like dropping these activities was due to feeling unable to participate, but it's possible that not engaging in them has contributed to feelings of unhappiness, which might worsen your symptoms.",false
36,Client,I'm not sure about that.,false
36,Therapist,"What if we focus on what you do with your time and try reintroducing some enjoyable activities? It could be as simple as meeting friends once a week. Additionally, reviewing the tablets you're taking to see which ones are helpful or potentially harmful might also be beneficial.",false
36,Client,"Hmm, I suppose that makes sense.",false
36,Therapist,Would you consider trying this new approach for two or three months to see if it helps?,false
36,Client,That's quite a long time if something serious is happening. My mother-in-law had a similar situation where they missed the signs.,false
36,Therapist,"If we decide to work together in this way, I'd schedule regular visits to monitor your symptoms. If anything changes, we can investigate further. But if things remain stable, it would confirm that there's nothing new to worry about. How does that sound?",false
36,Client,That sounds reasonable.,false
36,Therapist,Would you like to make an appointment for next week so we can discuss this approach in more detail and review your medications?,false
36,Client,"Yes, I'll schedule an appointment for next week to talk more about it.",false
36,Therapist,Great. Please bring a list of the tablets you're taking when you come in. This will help us evaluate them together. Does that sound good?,false
36,Client,"Okay, I'll make a list instead of bringing all the bottles.",false
36,Therapist,Perfect. Shall we see each other again next week then?,false
36,Client,"Yes, I'll book an appointment for next week.",false
36,Therapist,"Thank you, Barbara. See you soon.",false
36,Client,Thank you. Goodbye.,false
45,Therapist,"Hi, Mary. How was your day?",false
45,Client,Fine. Where do you want me to sign?,false
45,Therapist,You can sign right there. It seems like today might not be a good time for conversation.,false
45,Client,Not really.,false
45,Therapist,"I understand. It looks like you had a day at school and missed the first hour of class, is that correct?",false
45,Client,"Yeah, whatever. I just, yeah.",false
45,Therapist,It sounds like missing class isn't particularly concerning to you right now?,false
45,Client,It's just like the same thing every day; I don't really know why. So I signed your paper—why are you asking me all these questions?,false
45,Therapist,You seem curious about what our visits are for and why I come to your house.,false
45,Client,Yup.,false
45,Therapist,Would it be okay if I explained again what this program is about?,false
45,Client,I guess so.,false
45,Therapist,"My role as your caseworker involves checking in daily to ensure you're following the GPS requirements, that it's charged, and that you haven't left without permission. It also allows me to get to know you better during these visits.",false
45,Client,So you just want to know my business?,false
45,Therapist,I understand how it might seem intrusive at times.,false
45,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
45,Therapist,"Some clients find it hard to see that I genuinely care about them. When we first met, you mentioned wanting to complete this program quickly.",false
45,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
45,Therapist,Being here as needed is one way to achieve that goal.,false
45,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
45,Therapist,"Yet, there seems to be some frustration with these requirements still being in place.",false
45,Client,"Yeah. I mean, I'll be here if necessary, but I can't promise I won't leave.",false
45,Therapist,So you're uncertain about your ability to meet the program's expectations?,false
45,Client,"No, because it just feels like why do you need to know my business? Why does it matter to you?",false
45,Therapist,"That must feel confusing, especially with other people involved in your life, like the courts and your mom. It can be overwhelming.",false
45,Client,Mm-hmm. It's just a lot.,false
45,Therapist,"I hear that there are many rules, which can be challenging at times.",false
45,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
45,Therapist,Some clients have expressed how much they value their freedom once it’s taken away.,false
45,Client,"Right, I think that's the only thing I wish I had now.",false
45,Therapist,Your freedom?,false
45,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
45,Therapist,What steps do you think could help you regain your freedom?,false
45,Client,I guess like signing your papers.,false
45,Therapist,"Yes, signing the paperwork when I visit is an important step, even if it feels bothersome. It's part of our agreement.",false
45,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
45,Therapist,Are there other ways you believe you can work towards regaining your freedom?,false
45,Client,Not doing this again so that I don't have to be here or stuck in my house with all these people visiting and knowing my business.,false
45,Therapist,"So avoiding past mistakes is a strong motivator for you, especially since the visits are not enjoyable?",false
45,Client,Yup.,false
45,Therapist,"That's perfectly understandable. I appreciate your effort in signing the paperwork when I visit, even if it feels inconvenient at times. Thank you for doing that.",false
45,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
45,Therapist,"Before I leave today, is there anything else on your mind or something you'd like to share?",false
45,Client,Not really.,false
45,Therapist,"Okay, just so you know, I'll be back later today as planned.",false
45,Client,All right.,false
45,Therapist,All right.,false
45,Client,Bye.,false
42,Client,"I'm struggling a lot with losing the remaining weight. No matter how much I exercise and run, it feels like nothing else is changing.",false
42,Therapist,"It sounds like you've reached a plateau in your weight loss journey, and despite all your efforts to increase physical activity, it's not reflecting on the scale?",false
42,Client,"Yes, exactly. I'm unsure what I'm doing wrong because I keep exercising, but there are no changes.",false
42,Therapist,"So, it feels like you're putting in more effort with exercise, yet it’s not translating into results on the scale?",false
42,Client,That's right.,false
42,Therapist,And this situation is affecting how you feel about yourself?,false
42,Client,"Yes, and when I come home after going to the gym, seeing no progress makes me want to talk to my mom or dad. But they don't seem interested in supporting me at all.",false
42,Therapist,It sounds like you're feeling quite alone in this process?,false
42,Client,Absolutely.,false
42,Therapist,You expected support from them but it seems they aren’t providing the encouragement you need?,false
42,Client,"Yes, especially with my father. He doesn't just fail to support me; he actually thinks I should be gaining weight back.",false
42,Therapist,I see.,false
42,Client,Well—,false
42,Therapist,Could you share more about that experience?,false
42,Client,"It feels like by losing weight, I'm somehow drifting away from my family. My dad believes I’m trying to conform to an idealized image and all I want is to be healthy and have a good body, but he doesn't see it that way.",false
51,Therapist,Could you share what you understand about the flu shot?,false
51,Client,"Well, I know that the flu can be quite severe, but since I'm generally healthy, it doesn't seem necessary for me. Isn't it mostly just important for older adults?",false
51,Therapist,It sounds like you believe it's primarily beneficial for those who are more susceptible to illness.,false
51,Client,"Yes, exactly.",false
51,Therapist,Would you be open to hearing a bit more about the flu vaccine and its significance?,false
51,Client,Sure.,false
51,Therapist,"You're correct that being young and healthy means you might not experience severe symptoms if you catch the flu. However, we know that older adults, pregnant individuals, and babies are at higher risk for serious complications from the flu. By getting vaccinated, you also help prevent spreading it to others.",false
51,Client,I see.,false
51,Therapist,"With this information in mind, how do you feel about considering the flu vaccine?",false
51,Client,"Well, my grandparents might not handle the flu very well—",false
51,Therapist,I understand.,false
51,Client,"—and one of my coworkers is pregnant too. So, yes, I suppose it would be wise for me to get vaccinated on their behalf.",false
51,Therapist,"It sounds like you have people in your life who are vulnerable, and getting the flu shot could help protect them.",false
51,Client,"Yes, that makes sense.",false
54,Therapist,"Hello, Scott. It's good to see you again.",false
54,Client,Hi there.,false
54,Therapist,"Earlier, you mentioned wanting to discuss your exercise routine. Is that something you'd like to explore further?",false
54,Client,"Yes, I really want to talk about it.",false
54,Therapist,What seems to be the challenge with getting back into exercising?,false
54,Client,"It's just been difficult for me to return to the gym. I used to work out regularly, but over the past few years, life got busy, and now I've lost that habit. I feel like I need to get back on track.",false
54,Therapist,"Perhaps it might help if you take some time to write down your reasons for wanting to exercise again. On one side of the list, note those reasons, and on the other, brainstorm ideas that could support you in achieving this goal.",false
54,Client,"Okay, I'll try that. Um—All right. Um—",false
54,Therapist,Which gym are you a member of?,false
54,Client,I'm part of the Sport Fitness Center.,false
54,Therapist,How far is it from your home?,false
54,Client,It's just a couple of miles away.,false
54,Therapist,"That's not too far. You could consider biking or walking there as well, which would be beneficial for your health.",false
54,Client,"If I walked that distance, maybe I wouldn't even need to go inside the gym, right?",false
54,Therapist,"Well, it's important to balance cardiovascular activities with other forms of exercise like weightlifting and strength training. Both are crucial for overall fitness.",false
54,Client,"Yes, strength training is important too.",false
54,Therapist,Absolutely. So what motivates you in wanting to get back into exercising? Is it about changing your appearance or something else?,false
54,Client,"I think feeling better would be the main benefit. My clothes fit tighter around my waist these days, and I'd like to return to a more comfortable size, like a 34 or 36.",false
54,Therapist,"That makes sense. While improving your health is vital, it's understandable that you also want to feel good in your clothes again.",false
54,Client,"Yes, exactly. It's not just about looks; feeling comfortable and confident is important too. I'm aware that time is passing, and—",false
54,Therapist,"You've been successful at this before, so you know what steps to take.",false
54,Client,That's true.,false
54,Therapist,It’s really a matter of prioritizing it in your schedule.,false
54,Client,I need to make the time for it.,false
54,Therapist,"Exactly. This might mean adjusting other parts of your day, like waking up an hour earlier to fit exercise into your routine.",false
54,Client,"Yeah, that sounds doable.",false
54,Therapist,"Great. When we meet next, let's see how experimenting with waking up earlier works for you. Remember, improving your health is a priority over extra sleep. And don't forget to bring back the list we discussed.",false
54,Client,"Okay, I'll work on it.",false
54,Therapist,Perfect. See you next week then?,false
54,Client,"Yes, thank you.",false
54,Therapist,You're welcome. Take care until then. Goodbye.,false
57,Therapist,"Mr. Johnson, may I speak with you about your cholesterol and the medication prescribed by your doctor?",false
57,Client,Yes.,false
57,Therapist,"While your doctor is responsible for prescribing your medication, it's also my role to help you understand how to use it effectively and maximize its benefits.",false
57,Client,I've already discussed this with my doctor; that's his responsibility.,false
57,Therapist,"I understand. However, part of what I can offer is guidance on using the medicine properly and ensuring you get the most out of it.",false
57,Client,"Honestly, I'm still unsure about taking the medication. I know my cholesterol needs to be managed, but this drug could lead to severe muscle weakness, which I simply cannot afford as a truck driver who handles heavy loads daily.",false
57,Therapist,"Your doctor mentioned that if your cholesterol remains high, you're at risk for stroke or heart attack?",false
57,Client,"Yes, potentially in the future—",false
57,Therapist,The side effect of muscle weakness is very rare and shouldn't be a major concern compared to the significant risks of stroke or heart attack.,false
57,Client,"Right now, my main worry is about muscle weakness because it's immediate. I need to perform my job effectively.",false
57,Therapist,"I understand your concerns. However, this side effect is quite uncommon. If you experience any muscle weakness, please inform your doctor right away. It’s not permanent and won’t interfere with your work.",false
57,Client,Why don't you just give me the medication so I can take it home and think about it? My job is my priority.,false
57,Therapist,"Taking the medication is important, and as mentioned, muscle weakness is rare. If it occurs, inform your doctor; they can adjust or change your prescription if needed. It's not a permanent issue.",false
57,Client,"Alright, fine. Just—",false
57,Therapist,"Remember, it’s temporary.",false
57,Client,Whatever.,false
57,Therapist,"Considering the serious risks of stroke or heart attack, please ensure you pick up your medication on your way out and take one daily to manage your cholesterol levels.",false
57,Client,"Okay, sure, fine.",false
57,Therapist,Great. Thank you for understanding.,false
63,Therapist,"Tom, I understand this infection has been quite painful for you. However, we have antibiotics that can help. If you take them consistently for 10 days, your infection should clear up. Are you able to commit to doing that?",false
63,Client,Definitely.,false
63,Therapist,Great. May we discuss the screening form about drug use that you completed earlier today?,false
63,Client,Okay.,false
63,Therapist,Let's review it together. It mentions occasional drug use beyond medical reasons. Could you tell me which drugs you've used?,false
63,Client,I do some meth.,false
63,Therapist,Do you snort or smoke it?,false
63,Client,"Snort it, always snort it.",false
63,Therapist,And do you inject it at all?,false
63,Client,Mm-mm.,false
63,Therapist,Are there any other substances you use?,false
63,Client,Just some alcohol.,false
63,Therapist,How often would you say you use methamphetamine?,false
63,Client,Meth?,false
63,Therapist,"Yes, that's right.",false
63,Client,"Um, two or three times a month.",false
63,Therapist,So it sounds like you're an occasional user. You don't use it very frequently?,false
63,Client,Right.,false
63,Therapist,And you only snort it?,false
63,Client,Right.,false
63,Therapist,"As you may know, methamphetamine use carries certain health risks. The amount you've mentioned places you in a category we consider risky, which is different from being addicted but still concerning due to potential consequences like sexually transmitted diseases. Do you think your STD might be related to your meth use?",false
63,Client,"Yeah, it could be because I was high when I had unprotected sex and wouldn't do that if I weren't under the influence.",false
63,Therapist,"So typically, you're very cautious and use protection during sexual activity?",false
63,Client,"Definitely, yeah.",false
63,Therapist,It seems like methamphetamine might have affected your judgment in this instance?,false
63,Client,Yeah.,false
63,Therapist,Are there other ways methamphetamine is impacting your life?,false
63,Client,"No, not really. I only do it at clubs with friends a couple of times a month. But I'm concerned about this situation—I never expected to get gonorrhea.",false
63,Therapist,I share your concern and would recommend you stop using methamphetamine altogether for several reasons. That's my professional advice.,false
63,Client,"I understand, but stopping seems really challenging. It's integral to my social life; all my friends are there, it's where I meet them, and it's a big part of my sexual experiences. Everyone uses it at these places, so while I'd like to stop, it feels difficult to do immediately.",false
63,Therapist,"So you're aware that methamphetamine has some associated issues, yet your social and sexual life is deeply intertwined with its use, making quitting challenging?",false
63,Client,"Yeah, it wouldn't be easy, but I'm not saying I won't try.",false
63,Therapist,If we were to consider how prepared you are to stop using meth completely—on a scale from zero (not ready at all) to ten (fully ready)—where would you place yourself?,false
63,Client,"Uh, three.",false
63,Therapist,What makes it higher than one or two for you?,false
63,Client,"This experience with gonorrhea has been really uncomfortable. I know my judgment is impaired when I'm high. And what I have could lead to HIV or AIDS, which scares me a lot. That's why it's above one or two.",false
63,Therapist,Are there any other concerns about methamphetamine use?,false
63,Client,"Well, even though I just snort it, you never know what else it might be mixed with. It could be dangerous if cut with something harmful, and that worries me sometimes.",false
63,Therapist,"Earlier, I thought you might not be very interested in stopping meth use, but now it seems there are several reasons why you'd like to quit—concerns about impurities or the risk of other STDs including HIV. Is that correct?",false
63,Client,Yeah.,false
63,Therapist,What do you think could make it easier for you to reduce or stop using methamphetamine?,false
63,Client,"Maybe having something else to do on weekends, a different social life.",false
63,Therapist,How might you develop a different social life?,false
63,Client,That's the hard part—I know almost everyone I'm with uses it.,false
63,Therapist,Is there anyone in your circle who doesn't use methamphetamine?,false
63,Client,My sister.,false
63,Therapist,Have you considered talking to her about your meth use?,false
63,Client,"I haven't really talked to her, but she probably knows. We're close, and I think I could discuss it with her; she might be able to help.",false
63,Therapist,"On one hand, quitting meth is difficult due to the benefits you perceive from using it. On the other hand, there are compelling reasons for wanting to quit.",false
63,Client,Yes.,false
63,Therapist,"There may be steps you can take to make quitting easier, like talking to your sister and seeking her support.",false
63,Client,Yes.,false
63,Therapist,"That's excellent. While I recommend not using meth at all, the choice is ultimately yours.",false
63,Client,Okay.,false
63,Therapist,How about we schedule another appointment in a month? Would that work for you?,false
63,Client,"Yeah, sure.",false
69,Therapist,"Hello, Dr. Martin. I understand you have a question for me. What would you like to discuss?",false
69,Client,"Apologies, but are you the pharmacist? I need some information about citalopram.",false
69,Therapist,"Yes, I am the pharmacist on duty. Citalopram is an antidepressant available in 10, 20, and 40-milligram doses. It's excreted through urine with a half-life of approximately 35 hours. Common side effects include sexual, cardiac, and gastrointestinal issues.",false
69,Client,"I see, but my main concern was whether it interacts with phenelzine?",false
69,Therapist,"Oh, yes, I believe that should be fine.",false
69,Client,Thank you for your help. I have an appointment to attend now.,false
69,Therapist,You're welcome. Feel free to reach out anytime.,false
72,Therapist,"Chris, I need to discuss something important with you. As you know, our school has a strict no-drugs-and-alcohol policy. In my role as athletic director, it's essential for me to ensure all student-athletes are following this rule. Recently, there have been some rumors about a party where you were present, though I can't confirm the details. While I'm not at a point to impose consequences yet, I wanted to talk with you about your drinking habits and how they align with being part of our team.",false
72,Client,"Actually, I'd like to share something that happened over the weekend. Normally, as an honor student, I spend my weekends studying because my parents don't allow me to attend parties. However, I used this to persuade them to let me go to a party where my friends were pressuring me. When I arrived, it was unlike anything I'd experienced before—like scenes from movies with people drinking openly and engaging in games just to get drunk without any reason.",false
72,Therapist,Mm-hmm.,false
72,Client,Being there made me feel pressured to conform so as not to be left out or ostracized by my peers.,false
72,Therapist,"I understand. We've all faced similar situations at some point. During high school, I drank too. Kids in this town often drink because there's not much else to do. But remember, we have rules that you need to follow as a team member.",false
72,Client,I understand.,false
72,Therapist,Being on the team means adhering to those rules.,false
72,Client,"I know it's harmful for my health and performance as an athlete. It's just hard because my friends pressure me. Maybe I should consider different friend groups, but I'm not sure.",false
72,Therapist,"Chris, are you experiencing peer pressure?",false
72,Client,Being part of a sports team means feeling the need to be unified with the group.,false
72,Therapist,"But remember, you're one of the leaders on your team.",false
72,Client,"As a leader, my teammates expect me to lead both in sports and social settings. If that's a societal norm, then—",false
72,Therapist,Perhaps you could start leading by being a non-drinker?,false
72,Client,"I could try, but there's a risk of being ridiculed for not participating.",false
72,Therapist,"As a star player, who would dare to pick on you?",false
72,Client,It feels like it's just me against the majority.,false
72,Therapist,"The issue is that I can't keep hearing about your drinking or seeing pictures online. There are rules here, and as part of my job, I must enforce them. While I understand wanting to enjoy your teenage years, we need to find a way for you to stay on the team.",false
72,Client,"I'll commit to not partying at night or getting involved with alcohol to that extent, especially in ways that get publicized online.",false
72,Therapist,What do you mean by that?,false
72,Client,Like avoiding parties where there's pressure to drink and ensuring my private activities aren't shared online for others to see.,false
72,Therapist,We need an agreement if you're going to remain on the team. Is that clear?,false
72,Client,"Right, I'll stop.",false
72,Therapist,You promise?,false
72,Client,I promise.,false
72,Therapist,"All right, let's shake on it.",false
72,Client,Shake.,false
72,Therapist,See you later then.,false
72,Client,See you later.,false
72,Therapist,All right.,false
66,Therapist,"Hello, Mr. Stowe.",false
66,Client,Hi there.,false
66,Therapist,How are you feeling today? I'm Bruce Berger.,false
66,Client,Nice to meet you.,false
66,Therapist,I’m a case manager with your health plan. It seems like you're here to discuss managing your diabetes.,false
66,Client,"Yes, that's right. They told me I need to learn how to manage it because they just diagnosed me and said my blood sugar is extremely high. She explained all the serious consequences that could happen, which sounds really overwhelming. Then she listed everything I have to do, and honestly, I'm feeling pretty let down.",false
66,Therapist,"It seems like you've had a recent doctor's visit where you were unexpectedly informed about your diabetes diagnosis and its potential complications, including issues with your eyes and circulation.",false
66,Client,She also mentioned problems that could affect my legs—,false
66,Therapist,You're understandably overwhelmed by all this information. It sounds like it’s quite frightening for you.,false
66,Client,"Yes, it's not just fear; I don't want any of those things to happen. But when she starts listing everything I need to do and I think about whether I can manage it, I feel really anxious. Sitting here, thinking that all these negative outcomes might occur is daunting.",false
66,Therapist,"It seems like you're dealing with the fear of potential health consequences while also feeling overwhelmed by the tasks required to control your diabetes. You’re worried that if you can't do everything, those bad things will happen.",false
66,Client,"Exactly. It feels like an enormous challenge I might not be able to handle, and then all these terrible outcomes could occur. The situation seems very bleak and even worse than before.",false
66,Therapist,"What I'd like to do is help you break this down into manageable steps so we can work on lowering your blood sugar. Your doctor is correct that it's important to address the high levels to prevent those consequences. There are several things you need to do, but we can tackle them one at a time to make it less overwhelming.",false
66,Therapist,"I’d like to hear what actions you feel ready to take right now. For instance, there are three main areas to focus on with diabetes management: taking your medication as prescribed. If everything feels overwhelming, starting with this might have the most immediate impact. How does that sound?",false
66,Client,"Taking my medications doesn't seem too difficult, especially since I know my blood sugar is very high.",false
66,Therapist,That sounds manageable then.,false
66,Client,"Yeah, I'm pretty good at taking medication.",false
66,Therapist,It seems straightforward for you to take your medicine once a day as prescribed. So that's something we can start with right away.,false
66,Client,"Yes, I think I could manage that.",false
66,Therapist,"Over time, we'll also work on adjusting your diet to be healthier and increasing physical activity. This doesn't necessarily mean going to the gym; it could involve more walking or using stairs instead of elevators.",false
66,Client,"She also mentioned monitoring my blood sugar, which seemed like a lot of complicated information at first.",false
66,Therapist,"Monitoring your blood sugar is important because it provides feedback on how well these changes are working. It helps you see that taking medication and adjusting your diet are effectively lowering your blood sugar levels, preventing further health issues.",false
66,Client,I understand now.,false
66,Therapist,So where does this leave you in terms of how you're feeling about everything?,false
66,Client,"I appreciate the idea of tackling it step by step. That definitely eases some pressure off my shoulders. It's reassuring to know we can do this gradually, rather than trying to implement a massive change all at once. Starting with medication doesn't seem like a big issue for me.",false
66,Therapist,You sound very committed to starting with your medication.,false
66,Client,"Yes, I believe I can manage that as long as there aren’t any significant side effects.",false
78,Therapist,"Hello, are you Julie Thompson?",false
78,Client,"Yes, that's me.",false
78,Therapist,"Hi, I'm Bruce Berger from the clinic. I see you're here to pick up a prescription for Sarah's rescue inhaler for her asthma. It seems she has been in the emergency room five times this past year due to her asthma. How has that experience been for you?",false
78,Client,"It's been really tough. Seeing her struggle to breathe is heartbreaking, and I'm always anxious when we have to go to the hospital. Taking her there is very difficult.",false
78,Therapist,It sounds like you're willing to do anything possible to prevent those emergency visits.,false
78,Client,"Yes, absolutely.",false
78,Therapist,I also noticed it's been about three months since you picked up the prescription for her chronic inhaler. Are you facing any challenges with that?,false
78,Client,"Well, after researching the chronic inhaler, I discovered it contains steroids, which I'm hesitant to have Sarah take due to potential side effects and health risks. I've made sure not to smoke around her to protect her from my smoking.",false
78,Therapist,It's clear you care deeply about Sarah and want to avoid exposing her to steroids. You're also taking steps to ensure your smoking doesn't affect her asthma.,false
78,Client,"Yes, that's right.",false
78,Therapist,"Would it be okay if we discuss the chronic inhaler a bit more? I understand your concerns about steroids, especially those used by athletes, and I want to address them for you.",false
78,Client,Sure.,false
78,Therapist,"Although this medicine is in the same family as anabolic steroids, which can have masculinizing effects, it's quite different. Think of it like a grape versus a watermelon; they're related but vastly different in size and impact. The medication your daughter takes is very small in dose and specifically targets her lungs without entering her bloodstream. It safely reduces inflammation in her lungs. What are your thoughts on considering this for Sarah?",false
78,Client,"I hadn't realized they weren't the same as anabolic steroids, which can cause serious issues. If you assure me it won't have those side effects—",false
78,Therapist,"Absolutely not. The name corticosteroid might sound concerning, but rest assured, this medication is safe and only affects her lungs without entering her body like other steroids do.",false
78,Client,Okay.,false
78,Therapist,Would you mind if I explain what happens to Sarah's lungs during these flare-ups?,false
78,Client,Go ahead.,false
78,Therapist,"When someone has asthma, their lungs are extremely sensitive. Imagine having skin burned off your arm; a light touch would be painful without the protective layer of skin. Similarly, her lungs react intensely to irritants like dust and pollen. This chronic inhaler reduces inflammation, preventing such sensitivity.",false
78,Client,I see.,false
78,Therapist,"Another point is that even though you smoke outside, the residue on your clothes can still affect Sarah's sensitive lungs. If she uses the chronic inhaler regularly, it might reduce her sensitivity to this smoke residue. It would be ideal if you could quit smoking for both your health and hers, but let's focus on monitoring how the inhaler affects her reactions when you're around.",false
78,Client,Even just from my clothes?,false
78,Therapist,"Yes, unfortunately. Keeping an eye on that will help. Ideally, avoiding smoke residue or quitting would be best.",false
78,Client,I understand. Quitting is a daunting task though. It's challenging for many people.,false
78,Therapist,"Indeed, it can be very difficult and relaxing to quit smoking. What are some steps you might consider taking now if you're not ready to quit immediately?",false
78,Client,"Maybe if I only smoke when she's at school and change my clothes before she comes home, that could help?",false
78,Therapist,That sounds like a great plan if you can manage it. Just ensure you don't smoke inside the house.,false
78,Client,"Of course, never do that.",false
78,Therapist,"If you're willing to try this approach, it should make a difference for Sarah. And when you feel ready to quit smoking entirely, we'd be here to support you both.",false
78,Client,That would be helpful. Quitting is really tough.,false
78,Therapist,"Right now, it seems like using the chronic inhaler daily and keeping smoke off your clothes are steps you're willing to take. These changes should help reduce her emergency visits significantly.",false
78,Client,Really? That's a relief because those emergencies are always frightening.,false
78,Therapist,"Yes, reducing inflammation with the inhaler will likely prevent many of these incidents. Let's get both prescriptions ready for you. Use the chronic inhaler every day and keep the rescue inhaler on hand if needed. We'll see how this works out.",false
78,Client,Sounds good to me. Thank you.,false
78,Therapist,"You're welcome. Good luck, and we'll check in soon to see how things are going.",false
78,Client,Okay. Thank you again.,false
81,Therapist,How do you feel about the way your parents raised you?,false
81,Therapist,Could you share more about how your parents raised you?,false
81,Therapist,What have you been experiencing emotionally lately?,false
81,Client,Sure. I guess it's because I've been noticing changes in my size.,false
81,Therapist,Can you tell me more about what that experience feels like for you?,false
81,Client,"It’s kind of frightening, to be honest.",false
81,Therapist,So the physical changes are making you feel uneasy?,false
81,Client,"Yes. There's something happening inside, but I'm not sure what it is exactly.",false
81,Therapist,I see.,false
81,Client,"You know I need to make an appointment with a doctor, but I haven't done that yet.",false
81,Therapist,What do you think makes it difficult for you to reach out and schedule the appointment?,false
81,Client,"Honestly, it just feels like too much. It's overwhelming.",false
81,Therapist,Can you elaborate on what aspects feel overwhelming to you?,false
81,Client,"Well, I really dislike making phone calls, and there’s all that paperwork involved. Plus, I'm not sure how to get there, and I have a strong aversion to needles.",false
81,Therapist,So it sounds like the feeling of being overwhelmed is tied to both logistical concerns about the appointment and your general discomfort with medical settings?,false
81,Client,Exactly.,false
81,Therapist,How might we address these feelings together?,false
81,Client,Could you assist me in making that call?,false
81,Therapist,"Absolutely, let's do it together.",false
81,Client,Is it possible for you to accompany me to the appointment?,false
81,Therapist,"I'll try my best. While I can't promise due to my schedule, let’s explore options on who might be able to support you during your visit so that you feel more at ease.",false
96,Therapist,"Thank you for joining me today, Katie. I'm eager to learn more about you and understand what prompted your visit.",false
96,Client,"Sure, yeah. My doctor referred me here because he has some concerns regarding my pregnancy and my baby's well-being. So, I'm doing as instructed by him.",false
96,Therapist,It sounds like you're taking the step of meeting with me today based on your doctor's recommendation. Could you share a bit more about his specific concerns?,false
96,Client,He's worried about how much alcohol I consume.,false
96,Therapist,I see. Do you have any personal concerns regarding your alcohol intake?,false
96,Client,"Not really, no.",false
96,Therapist,So it seems this is primarily a concern for your doctor rather than something that worries you at the moment.,false
96,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
96,Therapist,Could we talk about your current drinking habits and perhaps some aspects of your life today to give me a better understanding?,false
96,Client,"Okay. I usually have a glass of wine with dinner each night, and sometimes when I'm out with friends. It's been part of my family tradition during meals.",false
96,Therapist,"So alcohol has been woven into your cultural practices, serving as a way to unwind a bit.",false
96,Client,"Yes, exactly. Plus, some of my friends have drunk during pregnancy without issues, and I've read articles suggesting there isn't a definitive link between drinking and abnormalities. It seems like an old wives' tale to me. I'm independent and want to make choices for myself regarding my body.",false
96,Therapist,"It sounds like you value your independence and prefer not to be told what's acceptable in terms of alcohol consumption. You've encountered mixed messages—your doctor advises against any drinking during pregnancy, while other sources suggest it might be safe. Have you been looking into this further?",false
96,Client,"Yes, I've researched to find information that supports my perspective.",false
96,Therapist,So you're inclined to make decisions based on what feels right for you and have gathered some supporting evidence along the way.,false
96,Client,"Exactly. I'm here now, so—",false
96,Therapist,It seems like you know your body best and prefer to be in control of your choices. You don't seem overly concerned about your alcohol use at this point.,false
96,Client,"No, not really.",false
96,Therapist,Are these mixed messages from friends and media influencing your perspective?,false
96,Client,"Yes, that's right.",false
96,Therapist,So you're questioning whether the doctor might be exaggerating the risks associated with drinking during pregnancy?,false
96,Client,Yeah. It seems like maybe he's overreacting a bit.,false
96,Therapist,Perhaps it feels extreme to completely stop drinking. Would you consider reviewing Canada's guidelines on alcohol consumption? Are you open to that idea?,false
96,Client,Right now?,false
96,Therapist,"Yes, right away. Could I show you a brochure about this?",false
96,Client,"Sure, why not.",false
96,Therapist,"According to the low-risk alcohol drinking guidelines for women, it's advised to limit intake to 10 drinks per week and no more than two in any single day, but only if they're not pregnant. For pregnancy, there is no safe amount of alcohol; zero is recommended. What are your thoughts on this?",false
96,Client,"I've heard similar things before, but I don't see the evidence or risk clearly outlined for me.",false
96,Therapist,So seeing it in black and white doesn't necessarily convince you that drinking during pregnancy might be harmful?,false
96,Client,It's just reiterating what I already know.,false
96,Therapist,It seems like the doctor's advice and this brochure feel like they're exaggerating the situation to you. You have information suggesting alcohol can be safe during pregnancy. Could you tell me more about that?,false
96,Client,"I've read various articles, and personally, people I know haven't faced any issues drinking while pregnant.",false
96,Therapist,It sounds like evidence is crucial for you. These articles you found—were they recent? Can you share more details about them?,false
96,Client,I don't have a bibliography or anything specific. They're just things that support my viewpoint.,false
96,Therapist,"So the information aligns with your values of independence and making autonomous choices, which contrasts with what your doctor shared and this brochure suggests.",false
96,Client,"Yes, it's like they're repeating the same message about no safe amount during pregnancy without explaining why.",false
96,Therapist,What questions do you have about the potential effects of drinking?,false
96,Client,I want to know what specific issues could arise from it.,false
96,Therapist,Let's set that aside for now and explore your intentions regarding having a baby. Was this something you planned?,false
96,Client,"Yes, it was planned.",false
96,Therapist,How important is it to you to have a healthy baby and be a good parent?,false
96,Client,It's very important. I want to ensure my child is healthy and raise them well.,false
96,Therapist,What does being a good parent mean to you?,false
96,Client,"It means being present, taking care of their needs like feeding and changing diapers—though the latter isn't exciting for me.",false
96,Therapist,"So it involves protecting and nurturing your baby, which seems very important to you. How do you reconcile this with the brochure's information?",false
96,Client,I'm unsure where these brochures get their data or what constitutes hard evidence.,false
96,Therapist,"You want clear, up-to-date evidence. The information I've shared is based on research since 2011, and while it's evidence-based, ultimately, you decide what's best for you and your baby. What are your thoughts?",false
96,Client,"It surprises me that the research dates back to 2011. If it's true, I want to do what's best for my child and myself. If quitting drinking is necessary, then I'll have to make that decision.",false
96,Therapist,You're making thoughtful decisions about your baby's well-being by doing your own research. It seems like this information wasn't what you expected.,false
96,Client,"No, it wasn't.",false
96,Therapist,What steps do you think would be helpful as you consider reducing alcohol during the rest of your pregnancy?,false
96,Client,I'd like to take a brochure home to discuss with my partner and get their support. Changing our habits by putting away the alcohol might help me today when I return home.,false
96,Therapist,"Those are significant changes you're considering, especially setting aside the alcohol. Thank you for exploring this with me today. Would you be open to continuing this conversation in our next session? We can discuss your progress and any further research or insights you gather.",false
96,Client,"Yes, that sounds like a good plan. Maybe you could also help me figure out how to approach my partner since they might share the same view as I did.",false
96,Therapist,"Absolutely, we'll cover that in our next meeting. Thank you for coming today.",false
96,Client,Thank you.,false
87,Therapist,"Let me explain what I typically do during our session. We'll have a conversation for about 20 minutes, where I provide feedback based on your questionnaires from last week and then discuss it together. However, I always like to begin with whatever topic you'd prefer.",false
87,Client,"Yes, that makes sense. When I was filling out those questionnaires, it felt strange because I don't usually see my drinking as a significant issue or think about how much I drink.",false
87,Therapist,I understand.,false
87,Client,"And when I had to record the amount I drank daily, it really surprised me.",false
87,Therapist,I see.,false
87,Client,Trying to count my drinks made me realize that it's actually quite a lot.,false
87,Therapist,It sounds like you were quite taken aback by what you discovered about your drinking habits.,false
87,Client,"Yes, because I thought I was drinking as much as my friends. When I discussed this with my roommate, she couldn't believe I had 10 drinks on the weekends alone, including Thursday through Sunday.",false
87,Therapist,That must have been surprising for her to hear.,false
87,Client,"She said it was crazy and asked where all that drinking happened. I told her various places, but apparently, my friends weren’t aware of this either. It's just odd.",false
87,Therapist,"This new information seems to be quite eye-opening for you, especially since your roommate was also surprised by how much you drink compared to what she thought.",false
87,Client,"Yes, and it made me realize that not everyone drinks as much as I assumed they did.",false
87,Therapist,So this realization—that your drinking is more than others—is something new for you?,false
87,Client,Exactly. That's the part of filling out those forms that was most surprising.,false
87,Therapist,"Okay, let’s explore that further.",false
90,Therapist,"Tommy, I wanted to talk with you because I saw some pictures on Facebook from a party that concern me. You're such a good kid, and it worries me to see you drinking. It could have serious consequences for your future.",false
90,Client,"Well, it was just a social gathering. The drinks were there, and everyone else was doing it. I don't usually drink often, but when the chance arises, it's nice to relax and enjoy myself occasionally.",false
90,Therapist,"Tommy, there are significant risks associated with drinking, especially since you're not yet 21. You could face legal issues or a drunk driving accident, which might affect your schoolwork. You have so much potential ahead of you, and I'm really worried about this.",false
90,Client,"I understand where you’re coming from, but I thought I had it under control. I didn't let myself go too far, and I wanted to ensure my friends were okay, so I limited how much I drank.",false
90,Therapist,"There's no such thing as drinking ""too little"" when you're underage; any amount is excessive. It’s important to consider the potential consequences of underage drinking.",false
90,Client,"Yes, I understand what you’re saying. And—",false
90,Therapist,How often do you find yourself drinking?,false
90,Client,"Not very much, really. It's mostly at social gatherings with friends. I don't drink alone or anything like that.",false
90,Therapist,Is it something you do every weekend?,false
90,Client,"More like every other weekend, probably.",false
90,Therapist,"Tommy, I'm genuinely concerned for your well-being. Can’t we think of healthier activities to engage in instead?",false
90,Client,I suppose I could focus more on my schoolwork and attend fewer parties. I understand where you're coming from.,false
90,Therapist,"Do you think the people you hang out with might be influencing this behavior? Perhaps spending time with friends who share your values, like those in the youth group, would help.",false
90,Client,Maybe it's not entirely my choice; I've been following their lead because it seems fun. I want to make sure I'm experiencing everything high school has to offer.,false
90,Therapist,"Many things seem appealing at first but aren't good choices in the long run. We often discuss making decisions that are best for your future, and I think you should seriously consider changing this habit.",false
90,Client,"I see how reducing my drinking could positively impact my life. It makes sense, and I can try to lower my alcohol consumption.",false
90,Therapist,I believe it's important for you to quit altogether.,false
90,Client,"Alcohol is everywhere in our society, and it seems like something I should at least understand before completely removing it from my life. I don't see it as something that will destroy me entirely.",false
90,Therapist,"I'm concerned because I think you're underestimating the risks. While cutting down is better than nothing, quitting would be ideal. Thank you for discussing this with me; we'll continue to talk about it.",false
90,Client,"Right now, I don't see a problem since I haven't had any traumatic experiences related to drinking. But—",false
90,Therapist,Do you want to wait until something bad happens before making a change?,false
90,Client,"You're right. I don't want to reach a point where things are out of control. I've never really experienced alcohol affecting me or my friends significantly, so it feels manageable, but maybe not as much as I think.",false
90,Therapist,Let's work on this together and develop a plan that helps you gain control over your drinking.,false
90,Client,That sounds like a positive step towards possibly leading a sober life and experiencing the true aspects of life without alcohol's haze.,false
90,Therapist,"Okay, great.",false
90,Client,Okay.,false
93,Therapist,"There are several areas we could explore. You've mentioned wanting to increase your physical activity, adjust your eating habits, and enhance body confidence. Which of these topics would you like to focus on today?",false
93,Client,"I think starting with physical activity is more manageable for me right now. Changing my nutrition habits seems harder initially, but establishing an exercise routine might help facilitate other changes later.",false
93,Therapist,"So, focusing on physical activity feels like the most accessible change to begin with.",false
93,Client,"Yes, that's what I'm thinking.",false
93,Therapist,"Wonderful. Could you share more about what motivates you to become more physically active? You've mentioned wanting better energy levels and improved mood, as well as reduced irritability and stress. Are there other benefits that inspire this change for you?",false
93,Client,"Definitely. Feeling stronger and more capable is important to me. For instance, last night I struggled with opening a jar of salsa. So, along with mood improvements and increased productivity and energy, feeling physically stronger is another key goal. Plus, being active might help improve my body image and confidence.",false
93,Therapist,"You're aiming for greater strength so you can handle everyday tasks like opening jars, and also to boost your self-confidence.",false
93,Client,Yes.,false
93,Therapist,"On a scale from zero to ten, where zero means not ready at all to change your physical activity habits and ten signifies full readiness and excitement, how would you rate yourself?",false
93,Client,I'd say about an eight.,false
93,Therapist,"So, it sounds like you're quite motivated. Why didn't you choose a six instead of an eight?",false
93,Client,"Well, as I mentioned, there are many benefits to being more active that appeal to me—like improved mood and energy—and feeling better about myself is important too. These factors contribute to my high motivation level.",false
93,Therapist,"It seems like the numerous advantages of physical activity, such as enhanced energy, mood, strength, and body confidence, are significant motivators for you today.",false
93,Client,Yes.,false
93,Therapist,Is there anything else I should know about your motivations?,false
93,Client,Not that I can think of.,false
93,Therapist,Those seem to be the main ones for you.,false
93,Client,Yes.,false
93,Therapist,Excellent. Let's explore how this might look and what activities could fit into your routine if you're interested.,false
93,Client,That would be great.,false
93,Therapist,"Okay, let's dive in.",false
102,Therapist,"Hi, Liz. Thank you for joining me today.",false
102,Client,Sure.,false
102,Therapist,What would you like to focus on changing or working towards?,false
102,Client,"Well, [sighs] I've been thinking about getting back into exercising. It's something I really want to do again. It's been on my mind; I know it's important for me. The challenge is finding the motivation to start.",false
102,Therapist,"You've mentioned wanting to work out quite a bit recently. It seems like this is an area you're eager to address soon, as there often appears to be more talk than action. To see the results you desire, taking steps towards it might be necessary. Perhaps setting aside any hesitation and committing could help.",false
102,Client,I don't think I'm being lazy about it. My schedule just keeps me busy.,false
102,Therapist,I understand.,false
102,Client,"Finding time is my main issue. While motivation may sometimes feel lacking, I believe it's more about timing and fitting exercise into my routine.",false
102,Therapist,"It sounds like there might be some barriers to overcome. You mentioned having a gym membership before, which suggests you have the resources available. Incorporating workouts into your schedule could help you achieve the results you're aiming for. Perhaps planning for three to four sessions per week would make a difference.",false
102,Client,"The challenge is that I don't have three to four times a week or even an hour available. An hour-long workout means accounting for travel time too, which extends it further.",false
102,Therapist,"It seems like dedicating the necessary time is crucial if you want to see the results you're hoping for. If it takes two hours in total, then that's what it will take. Starting now could be a step towards achieving your goals.",false
102,Client,"Well, oh, um, okay.",false
102,Therapist,I look forward to our conversation tomorrow and hope you'll share some progress about visiting the gym.,false
102,Client,Okay.,false
102,Therapist,Thank you.,false
99,Therapist,"Steve, before we conclude today's session, would you be open to discussing your drinking habits for a few minutes?",false
99,Client,"Sure, what do you mean by that?",false
99,Therapist,"I appreciate you completing the survey earlier. It was very helpful. Let me go over some of your responses with you. You mentioned drinking two to three times weekly and consuming three or four drinks each time. Additionally, you indicated having six or more drinks on certain occasions.",false
99,Client,"Yes, that sounds about right.",false
99,Therapist,Does this accurately reflect your drinking habits?,false
99,Client,"Well, mostly on the weekends.",false
99,Therapist,I see. I wanted to express some concern regarding your drinking levels. Excessive alcohol consumption can exacerbate existing issues and lead to health complications. Have you considered how your drinking might relate to the anxiety and insomnia you mentioned today?,false
99,Client,"Not really, no. I don't think I drink excessively in the first place—",false
99,Therapist,I understand.,false
99,Client,—so it's hard for me to believe that my drinking is causing my anxiety.,false
99,Therapist,That makes sense.,false
99,Client,"Actually, on nights when I avoid alcohol, I find it even harder to fall asleep.",false
99,Therapist,"Many people feel that alcohol helps them sleep better. However, while it might help you fall asleep faster, there's a ""rebound effect"" where you could wake up in the middle of the night or early morning and struggle to go back to sleep.",false
99,Client,That does happen; I often wake up around 2 AM on nights when I've had too much to drink.,false
99,Therapist,"Let me show you this chart. For someone your age, male, drinking more than a low-risk level is concerning. The low-risk guideline for men under 65 is no more than 14 drinks weekly and four in one day. A standard drink equals 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or an ounce and a half of spirits. Although you're not at the highest levels, your responses place you in the high-risk category.",false
99,Client,Really? I didn't realize it was that serious.,false
99,Therapist,"It's helpful to have this perspective. On a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 means no desire to change and 10 indicates a strong desire to change, how would you rate your readiness?",false
99,Client,"Honestly, I'm surprised by all of this. I want to stay healthy, especially since I'm training for a marathon. So maybe around five.",false
99,Therapist,That's a good starting point. What prevented you from rating it lower than five?,false
99,Client,"Well, my health is important because I'm preparing for the marathon and need better sleep. But I don't see myself as a hazardous drinker or an alcoholic, so five seems fair.",false
99,Therapist,"That makes sense. You've mentioned your commitment to health and training for the marathon, which requires good sleep. It's understandable that you're surprised by being categorized as high-risk.",false
99,Client,"Yes, exactly.",false
99,Therapist,"Considering this information, what are you willing to consider changing right now?",false
99,Client,I think reducing my drinking would be a natural step.,false
99,Therapist,What might that look like for you specifically?,false
99,Client,Perhaps limiting myself to three or four times a week and cutting back to no more than five or six beers on weekends.,false
99,Therapist,"Writing down your goals can sometimes help when making changes. If you were to outline your drinking goals here, what would they be?",false
99,Client,"Doing the math, I'd aim for no more than 18 drinks per week.",false
99,Therapist,"That's a positive step forward. While it still places you above the low-risk category, aiming for fewer than 14 drinks weekly is advisable eventually. Nonetheless, this is an improvement and a commendable start.",false
99,Client,Thank you.,false
99,Therapist,I look forward to discussing your progress at our next appointment in a month.,false
99,Client,Sure thing.,false
99,Therapist,"Great, see you then.",false
108,Therapist,Thank you for coming to see me today. I understand from your counselor that you have a lot on your plate. Could you share more about what's been going on?,false
108,Client,"Sure, I have a two-year-old son and work full-time as a server at a restaurant. Recently, I've also started night classes, so it's just all becoming overwhelming. Lately, I've felt really stressed.",false
108,Therapist,That sounds quite challenging. May I ask if you're raising your son on your own?,false
108,Client,"Yes, I am.",false
108,Therapist,"You have several stressors at the moment—being a single mom to a two-year-old, working full-time, and attending school. What would be most helpful for us to focus on today?",false
108,Client,"Well, I mentioned to my counselor that childcare is probably my biggest issue right now.",false
108,Therapist,Could you tell me more about your concerns with childcare?,false
108,Client,"Sure. My mom usually watches my son, but lately she's been unreliable and backs out at the last minute. This has caused me to call in sick at work a few times and miss classes. It’s stressful not knowing if I’ll be able to manage these responsibilities.",false
108,Therapist,"So it sounds like relying on your mom isn't ideal, leading you to miss work and class occasionally, which is problematic for you.",false
108,Client,"Yes, exactly.",false
108,Therapist,"Aside from your mom, is there anyone else who might help with childcare?",false
108,Client,"I have a sister, but I don’t trust her with my son. The only other option I can think of is a neighbor who helped once when my mom couldn't make it. She has a three-year-old daughter, so it worked out that time.",false
108,Therapist,It seems like this neighbor was supportive when you needed help the most.,false
108,Client,"Yes, she was.",false
108,Therapist,"When you picked up your son after that, did you notice any issues or concerns?",false
108,Client,"No, he seemed happy and I didn't have any worries.",false
108,Therapist,"Let's explore the possibility of working with this neighbor further. While many people struggle with childcare affordability, it sounds like she could be a valuable resource for you.",false
108,Client,"Yes, that’s true. But honestly, my income is too low to afford daycare or regular babysitting services.",false
108,Therapist,I understand how challenging that can be financially. What are some skills you have that might help in this situation?,false
108,Client,"Well, I enjoy cooking and am actually studying culinary arts.",false
108,Therapist,That’s great! You must be quite skilled at cooking. How about considering a plan where you offer to cook meals for your neighbor and her daughter in exchange for childcare? It could be an arrangement where you swap child care for meals. What do you think of that idea?,false
108,Client,"Hmm, I haven't thought of something like that before, but it might work.",false
108,Therapist,I'm glad you're open to the idea. Is there anyone else who might assist with your childcare needs?,false
108,Client,Not really; there aren’t many people I trust enough with my son right now.,false
108,Therapist,"That makes sense; trusting someone with your child is crucial, and it's important to follow your intuition on that matter. How about the baby’s father? Is he able to help at all?",false
108,Client,"[chuckles] No, not really. He hasn’t been involved since my son was born.",false
108,Therapist,"It sounds like we have a promising lead with your neighbor. If you pursue this option, it might alleviate some of your childcare challenges. How many nights per week do you attend school?",false
108,Client,"I go to class on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday nights.",false
108,Therapist,"So if both your neighbor and your mom could assist you, how would that change things for you?",false
108,Client,"If my neighbor could take over just one day of watching my son, it might ease the burden on my mom significantly.",false
108,Therapist,It seems like reducing the time you need from your mom might make her more willing to help. What do you think your next steps should be in coordinating with your neighbor and your mom?,false
108,Client,"I guess I would start by talking to my neighbor about this idea, and if she’s interested, then discuss it with my mom. Hopefully, that will improve the situation.",false
108,Therapist,"That sounds like a solid plan. Now, since your son is almost three, have you considered enrolling him in Head Start when he turns three?",false
108,Client,I've heard of it but don't know much about it.,false
108,Therapist,Head Start is an affordable and high-quality preschool program designed for families with lower incomes. It prepares children socially and intellectually for school. Would you like more information on local Head Start programs?,false
108,Client,"Yes, that sounds beneficial for my son and would definitely help me with childcare.",false
108,Therapist,Great! It seems like you have a good plan moving forward. I also noticed in the nurse practitioner's notes that you're working on reducing smoking and drinking. How is that going?,false
108,Client,"[chuckles] It’s been tougher than expected, especially changing my evening routine. But there are nights when I meet my goals for cigarettes and drinks.",false
108,Therapist,"So it's been more challenging than anticipated, but you’re committed to making progress. Have you considered the impact of secondhand smoke on your son?",false
108,Client,"Yes, I try not to smoke around him and always go outside if I do smoke at home.",false
108,Therapist,"That’s very considerate of you. It’s clear that you have your son's best interests in mind. Reflecting on our discussion today, we've identified potential childcare options with your neighbor and Head Start programs. What are your next steps to make these plans a reality?",false
108,Client,I’ll start by talking to my neighbor about the idea and then discuss it with my mom if she’s interested. And I definitely want to look into the Head Start program because it seems like a good fit.,false
108,Therapist,"That sounds like a well-thought-out plan. How about we meet again in two weeks to review your progress? If you’ve made arrangements, that's great; if not, we can brainstorm other solutions together.",false
108,Client,Okay.,false
108,Therapist,"Thank you for coming today, Sarah. It was nice meeting you.",false
108,Client,Thanks.,false
108,Therapist,You're very welcome.,false
105,Therapist,Could you share more about your experience with exercise since our last conversation?,false
105,Client,"Since we last spoke, I've managed to visit the gym a couple of times.",false
105,Therapist,That's great to hear.,false
105,Client,"Yes, and interestingly, my pants are fitting better now, which makes me quite happy.",false
105,Therapist,"Besides your clothes fitting better, have you noticed any other changes?",false
105,Client,I do feel an overall improvement in how I feel.,false
105,Therapist,Mm-hmm.,false
105,Client,My back—,false
105,Therapist,Your back? Could you tell me more about that?,false
105,Client,"Well, my back pain has significantly decreased.",false
105,Therapist,That's wonderful to hear.,false
105,Client,"However, it still feels challenging. I'd like to go more often, but perhaps I need to be a bit more patient with myself and gradually increase the time spent at the gym.",false
105,Therapist,Mm-hmm. What do you think would help you build up your routine?,false
105,Client,I suppose just staying committed and avoiding distractions might help.,false
105,Therapist,Mm-hmm.,false
105,Client,"For instance, last week was tough—I didn't make it until Thursday during the weekdays—",false
105,Therapist,Mm-hmm.,false
105,Client,"—so it felt like a frustrating week for my gym routine. I had other commitments that kept me busy, but—",false
105,Therapist,Mm-hmm. But you did manage to go at least one day—,false
105,Client,"Yes, and I also went again on Saturday.",false
105,Therapist,That's fantastic progress.,false
105,Client,"Yeah, even with a hectic schedule.",false
105,Therapist,It sounds like you're managing well despite the busy times.,false
105,Client,"It has been quite hectic. And while I'm there, seeing younger guys who lift more or stay longer on the treadmill can be discouraging. They seem so fit compared to me, and it makes me wonder how much effort it will take for me to get back in shape.",false
105,Therapist,So you're feeling a bit discouraged by their fitness levels?,false
105,Client,"Not necessarily wanting to become buff, but when I'm at the gym surrounded by those young, strong guys, that desire surfaces. However, when I'm not there and thinking rationally, I realize I'm past the age where becoming buff is practical or desirable.",false
105,Therapist,"So for now, it seems like having your pants fit better—",false
105,Client,Yes.,false
105,Therapist,—is a positive change that makes you feel good about yourself. Are there any other benefits you've noticed from exercising?,false
105,Client,"Well, I still need to improve my diet significantly. While working out has helped me make some changes, they're not as substantial as I'd like. I'm eating less junk food and sometimes reconsider before indulging in something unhealthy.",false
105,Therapist,So you're reaching that point of second thoughts. What might push you towards actually giving in?,false
105,Client,"When I start seeing tangible results from the gym, it changes my perspective. For example, if I've lost a pound during the week, when faced with someone enjoying a decadent dessert, I think about how much effort it would take to burn off that treat.",false
105,Therapist,So you're weighing the benefits of your workout against indulging in something like that rich dessert?,false
105,Client,Exactly. The thought of spending two hours on the treadmill for one slice of cake usually stops me from ordering it.,false
105,Therapist,"I see, so the effort doesn't seem worth it compared to enjoying a decadent treat.",false
105,Client,"Right, and why do they even call food ""decadent""?",false
105,Therapist,Because it truly is indulgent and delicious.,false
105,Client,"Okay. But overall, things are going well. I'm quite pleased with my progress and grateful for our last conversation—it motivated me to return to the gym after a long break.",false
114,Therapist,"To summarize, according to the Minnesota State Mankato security report, you were stopped on Stadium Road last Friday for driving under the influence and taken to detox. The report also states your age as 20. Dylan, how accurate is this information? Could you share more about what led up to that incident?",false
114,Client,"Yeah, that sounds right. I was a bit drunk, and it happened last week. I drove over to my friend's house to watch the game, had some beers, and then the Vikings started losing badly. We ended up drinking more than usual. When it was time to leave, I couldn't find a ride, so I just drove.",false
114,Therapist,"It sounds like you drank more than intended because of how disappointed you were with the game's outcome. And when your roommate wasn't available for a ride home, you chose to drive yourself. Is that correct?",false
114,Client,"Yes, exactly. I'm just a regular college student who likes to hang out and drink with friends. It wasn’t a big party or anything; it was just me getting caught.",false
114,Therapist,"I understand that your intention was simply to enjoy the game with your friends. You didn't foresee any issues because you were at a friend's house, not a large gathering, and you tried to be safe by arranging for a ride home.",false
114,Client,"Yeah, I did try to be safe. I called her roommate, but it seems like I ended up in trouble anyway.",false
114,Therapist,"Dylan, you mentioned what brought you here today. What do you think is the real issue?",false
114,Client,"Well, I might say I have a drinking problem, but maybe it's more about getting caught. My friends drink a lot too and never get caught, while I end up in this situation.",false
114,Therapist,"It seems like you feel that bad luck played a role here. If you believe that without changing your behavior, what consequences do you think might follow?",false
114,Client,"More trouble with the police and school, for sure. I really don't have time or money to deal with any of that right now.",false
114,Therapist,"How important is it for you to avoid future issues with law enforcement or school, Dylan?",false
114,Client,"It's very important. Just going through detox was awful, and my dad said if I get suspended from school, I'd have to work on my uncle’s farm in Iowa, which would ruin my social life. Plus, my parents already took away my car after the DUI.",false
114,Therapist,What are you willing to do to prevent another trip to detox or a suspension?,false
114,Client,"Well, I guess I wouldn't drink as much and try to avoid situations where trouble is more likely. So probably drinking less would be a start.",false
114,Therapist,"On a scale from 1 to 10, how confident are you that you can follow through with this plan, with 10 being very confident?",false
114,Client,"Maybe around six—I'm not sure, but over halfway there.",false
114,Therapist,What steps could help increase your confidence from a six to a seven or eight?,false
114,Client,"I could probably be more mindful of where I drink. Like staying in my apartment so I don't risk driving, or waiting until I’m 21 before drinking at parties. Maybe finding activities that don’t revolve around alcohol—there has to be more to do than just drinking.",false
114,Therapist,How might your life improve if you succeed in making these changes?,false
114,Client,"Well, for one, I wouldn’t be hungover all the time and could make it to my 8:00 AM classes. Right now, even when I get there, I’m so groggy that I end up sleeping through them and missing tests. If I reprioritize what’s important, like in high school where I had a 3.5 GPA, I know I can do well here too.",false
114,Therapist,"College involves making choices. Can you share your beliefs and values that influence your decisions, and how they align with the changes you plan to make regarding drinking?",false
114,Client,"Education is really important to me and my family—they always emphasize it. I want to be an international journalist, so if I focus on what’s necessary, like not drinking as much, I won’t disappoint my parents and can get a good education.",false
114,Therapist,Thank you for participating today. Your sanction includes being placed on university disciplinary probation and attending an alcohol education seminar that costs $150.,false
114,Client,"Okay, when is the seminar?",false
117,Therapist,"Hello, it's good to see you again. Could you share what brought you here today?",false
117,Client,I'm just tired of my drinking habits. It feels like I've been drinking too much lately. I thought maybe talking to someone could help.,false
117,Therapist,"So, it sounds like you're recognizing that your drinking is becoming a concern for you right now?",false
117,Client,"Yes, it's definitely gotten worse over the past six months.",false
117,Therapist,What makes you feel that it has worsened during this time?,false
117,Client,"Well, I used to drink socially before, but after breaking up with my boyfriend about a year ago and deciding to go out again six months back to meet new people, things changed.",false
117,Therapist,I see.,false
117,Client,"Now, I've developed the habit of going out every Friday and Saturday night, drinking quite heavily in an attempt to connect with others.",false
117,Therapist,Understood.,false
117,Client,"Recently, I've also started drinking more on weekdays, which wasn't something I used to do before.",false
117,Therapist,"So, it seems that since you decided to take a chance and go out again to meet potential partners about six months ago, your drinking has increased. Is that correct?",false
117,Client,"Yes, exactly. Normally, I feel awkward talking to guys, so the alcohol helps me relax.",false
117,Therapist,It sounds like drinking is currently serving as a way for you to ease your nerves when trying to interact with potential partners?,false
117,Client,"Absolutely, it definitely does.",false
117,Therapist,"Specifically, when approaching men?",false
117,Client,"Yes, that's right.",false
117,Therapist,"I understand. So, while alcohol helps you feel more at ease in social situations, it doesn't seem to be effective in helping you meet people and often results in hangovers. Is that what you're experiencing?",false
117,Client,"Exactly. Sometimes I do talk to people, but usually, I'm too drunk, and my friends end up driving me home without much interaction happening.",false
117,Therapist,"Given this situation, what would you like to change or achieve?",false
117,Client,"I want to stop drinking so much, especially during the weekdays. It's becoming excessive, and it doesn't feel right anymore.",false
117,Therapist,"So, you're noticing that your increased weekday drinking is affecting other areas of your life, such as your diet?",false
117,Client,"Yes, I don’t want to quit completely, but I need to cut back because my eating habits have suffered. I'm not eating properly and often just grab takeaway food.",false
117,Therapist,It sounds like you're committed to reducing your alcohol intake during the weekdays. Is that correct?,false
117,Client,"Yes, definitely. I feel it's necessary.",false
117,Therapist,You've mentioned that drinking helps you socially when going out with friends. Would you say it makes socializing easier for you?,false
117,Client,"Yes, and all my friends drink too. If I didn't join in, I'd have no social life at all.",false
117,Therapist,"So, while there are some benefits to your current drinking habits, like enjoying time with friends, you're noticing that the negative impacts outweigh these positives. Is that right?",false
117,Client,"Yes, it's just gotten out of control recently.",false
117,Therapist,Have you ever tried reducing your alcohol consumption before this point?,false
117,Client,"No, this is a new situation for me. I had my boyfriend for six years before he left, and my friends didn't drink as much back then.",false
117,Therapist,"It sounds like you're aware of the pattern that's developed recently and are ready to address it. On a scale from 0 to 100, where 100 is extremely important, how crucial is it for you to cut down on drinking?",false
117,Client,I'd say about an 80. That's why I'm here.,false
117,Therapist,Coming in today to discuss this shows your commitment to making changes. Why do you feel an 80 rather than a lower number like 50?,false
117,Client,"It just reached a point where it felt overwhelming, especially since no one else is drinking as much during the week either.",false
117,Therapist,"So, there's a strong sense of urgency for you to make a change before things potentially get worse. Is that correct?",false
117,Client,"Yes, exactly. I see it continuing down this path if I don't do something about it now.",false
117,Therapist,"It seems like over the past six months, you've noticed an increasing pattern in your drinking and its negative impact on your lifestyle, prompting you to take action. What's your next step?",false
117,Client,That's why I'm here. [chuckles] I think focusing on cutting out weekday drinking is crucial.,false
117,Therapist,"So, are you considering keeping weekdays alcohol-free as a first goal?",false
117,Client,"Yes, that sounds like a good plan. It's definitely what I intend to do.",false
117,Therapist,You seem determined to make these changes and get back into healthier routines. How does this sound for your next steps?,false
117,Client,Talking about it makes me realize how important it is to take action now.,false
120,Therapist,"I'm glad we've clarified that, and I believe you'll start feeling better over the next few days.",false
120,Client,"Thank you so much, doctor. I plan to take it easy for a couple of days.",false
120,Therapist,"Since we have some time left today, there's another topic I'd like to discuss with you. I've noticed your blood pressure and weight have been gradually increasing over recent years. We haven't had the chance to explore this much before, but I might be able to offer some helpful strategies. Would it be alright if we spent a few minutes talking about weight management and health?",false
120,Client,"Sure, I suppose so. I'm aware that my weight is an issue, but every attempt I make to lose it results in gaining it back again. I just don't know what steps to take next.",false
120,Therapist,I understand how challenging this can be. Managing weight often feels frustrating. Perhaps we could start working on this together and I'll support you through any obstacles that arise.,false
120,Client,"Thank you, doctor. However, I'm worried about finding the time to lose weight with my busy work schedule and taking care of the kids.",false
120,Therapist,"That's completely understandable. We both know there are many factors involved in managing weight, but there's no need to tackle everything today, especially given your current commitments. Maybe we could brainstorm a small change that fits into your life now, and then consider additional steps when you're ready.",false
120,Client,"That sounds good. So, what should I do?",false
120,Therapist,"Let’s explore this together. One important aspect of managing weight is staying active. Physical activity benefits the entire body—it's beneficial for our joints, helps manage stress levels, and plays a crucial role in maintaining a healthy weight. Perhaps we could discuss ways to incorporate more physical activity into your daily routine.",false
120,Client,"I expected you'd suggest that, but honestly, my schedule doesn't allow time for an hour at the gym every day.",false
120,Therapist,I understand that completely; I also don’t have an hour each day to spend at the gym. The good news is that any amount of physical activity can be beneficial. Let’s think about activities you enjoy doing.,false
120,Client,I enjoy walking.,false
120,Therapist,"Walking is a wonderful form of exercise, and I personally enjoy it too.",false
120,Client,But isn't walking too mild to help with weight loss?,false
120,Therapist,"Actually, even short walks are very healthy and beneficial. When you have more time for longer walks, that's great too. Plus, the beauty of walking is that it can be done anywhere, not just at a gym.",false
120,Client,"That sounds promising. You know what? I do have some free time before work today, and there’s a nice park nearby. Maybe I could take a short walk after this appointment.",false
120,Therapist,That sounds like an excellent idea.,false
120,Client,"And you know, I used to love dancing but haven't done it in ages.",false
120,Therapist,Dancing is fantastic exercise because it's enjoyable as well.,false
120,Client,"Hmm. Plus, my family would support me if I found a place to dance regularly.",false
120,Therapist,That’s wonderful to hear your family is supportive. There might be a dance class nearby or even a dance fitness class at the gym that you could try.,false
120,Client,"Yes, and actually, I'm quite interested in trying that out.",false
120,Therapist,Would you consider researching this option and giving it a go?,false
120,Client,"Absolutely, I’m genuinely excited about it. What else do you suggest?",false
120,Therapist,Small steps can make a significant impact. Simple actions like taking the stairs instead of the elevator occasionally or parking further from store entrances to add more movement into your day can be helpful.,false
120,Client,Mm-hmm. That sounds manageable.,false
120,Therapist,"Let's start with these small changes and plan to check in a few weeks to see how things are going, then we can discuss additional strategies if needed.",false
120,Client,"Diet, the dreaded D word.",false
120,Therapist,"Not necessarily. What we eat is important for weight management and health, but just like today, we can focus on manageable steps that fit into your life and make you feel good about them.",false
120,Client,"I appreciate that approach. Okay, I'll schedule a follow-up appointment and start dancing right away, doc.",false
120,Therapist,That's wonderful to hear. I look forward to seeing how it goes. See you soon.,false
111,Therapist,"Hi, are you Katie?",false
111,Client,Yeah.,false
111,Therapist,"Hello, I'm Beth. I work alongside Nurse Practitioner Mrs. Smith whom you just met. Do you have a moment to chat?",false
111,Client,"Uh, sure. What's this about?",false
111,Therapist,"You came in for a birth control prescription, but while waiting, you completed a healthy habits questionnaire that included questions about your marijuana use. Would it be alright if I ask you some questions regarding how marijuana fits into your life?",false
111,Client,Sure.,false
111,Therapist,"It seems like you use marijuana regularly, and I'd like to explore this further with you.",false
111,Client,"Well, they just decriminalized it in Virginia, so it's not a big deal. Am I in trouble?",false
111,Therapist,"No, absolutely not. Not at all. I'm interested in understanding how it benefits you and your usage patterns. Could you share more about that?",false
111,Client,It's not a big deal. Just a couple of times a week to unwind.,false
111,Therapist,So marijuana plays an important role for you in helping you relax?,false
111,Client,"Yeah. I mean, I'm on an academic scholarship, so maintaining my grades is crucial, and being part of the debate team means there's a lot going on.",false
111,Therapist,"It sounds like you're excelling academically while juggling many responsibilities, which must be quite stressful.",false
111,Client,"Well, yeah. The truth is I'm the first in my family to attend college, so it feels overwhelming at times.",false
111,Therapist,"You've achieved a lot academically, and transitioning to college has been challenging for you.",false
111,Client,I've always struggled with anxiety. Pot just helps me calm down. Am I in trouble?,false
111,Therapist,Please know that you're not in any trouble; my goal is to support you.,false
111,Therapist,"Besides helping you relax, what other positive aspects does marijuana bring into your life?",false
111,Client,"Well, some of these kids are more sophisticated than me, so when I party with them, it feels like I'm fitting in somehow.",false
111,Therapist,"When you use marijuana socially, it seems to help you feel more connected and accepted among your peers?",false
111,Client,I don't know if I feel more accepted; it's more about trying to fit in by using it.,false
111,Therapist,How effective is this approach in helping you feel like you belong with your friends?,false
111,Client,I'm not sure it is.,false
111,Therapist,"So, while smoking pot with peers might be an attempt to connect, it doesn't seem to make you more comfortable socially.",false
111,Client,"Uh, yeah.",false
111,Therapist,What are some negative aspects of smoking marijuana for you?,false
111,Client,I don't know. It helps me relax but I'm worried about getting caught. My parents would disapprove if they found out.,false
111,Therapist,"So while it aids in relaxation, using marijuana also increases your stress due to concerns about social acceptance and potential repercussions from family or legal issues?",false
111,Client,Yeah.,false
111,Therapist,Are there any other downsides you can think of regarding smoking pot?,false
111,Client,"Well, I don't have the money for it. I usually borrow from my roommate; her parents give her spending money, but asking feels embarrassing.",false
111,Therapist,So using marijuana also highlights your financial constraints and makes you feel uncomfortable about relying on others financially?,false
111,Client,Yeah.,false
111,Therapist,"Katie, it seems like smoking pot helps you relax to some extent, yet it's causing significant stress as you try to fit in socially, worry about being caught, and fear family disapproval. Considering all this, what are your thoughts on how you might want to address your marijuana use?",false
111,Client,"I don't know. When you put it that way, it doesn't sound like a very good habit.",false
111,Therapist,Would it be alright if I offered some suggestions?,false
111,Client,Okay.,false
111,Therapist,"Earlier, you mentioned dealing with anxiety; have you ever considered speaking to a counselor about this?",false
111,Client,No. We don't do that in my family.,false
111,Therapist,Could you elaborate on that for me?,false
111,Client,"It's just not something we do. I don't know. It's seen as something only crazy people need, and we definitely can't afford it.",false
111,Therapist,"So within your family, counseling is viewed as a last resort for those who are considered ""crazy,"" and the cost would be prohibitive?",false
111,Client,Yeah. I just don't see it happening.,false
111,Therapist,"Many students experience stress and anxiety when they come to college, but we've found that talking with our counselors and learning specific coping skills can significantly improve their well-being. It's been very effective for many students. Do you think this might be beneficial for you?",false
111,Client,I don't know.,false
111,Therapist,Can you share why you're feeling hesitant about it?,false
111,Client,"Well, I can't afford it and my parents wouldn't approve.",false
111,Therapist,"Our counseling services are free of charge, and we're legally required to maintain your privacy. We won't inform your parents unless there's a serious concern for your safety.",false
111,Client,"What, like suicidal?",false
111,Therapist,"Exactly. If you decide to see a counselor, we can discuss the specifics of our confidentiality policies, but generally, you wouldn't need to worry about us sharing anything with your parents.",false
111,Client,Okay. I guess I'll think about it.,false
111,Therapist,"If you're ready to leave now, I can accompany you and show you around our counseling center. I could even introduce you to one of the counselors if you'd like.",false
111,Client,Do I have to go there?,false
111,Therapist,"No, not at all. I just wanted to make sure you know about the resources available here at college.",false
111,Client,"Okay, sure. Let's go.",false
4,Therapist,"Hello, Emily. It's good to see you again.",false
4,Client,Hi.,false
4,Therapist,"Yes, it has been some time since we last met.",false
4,Client,"Indeed, it has.",false
4,Therapist,I noticed something new about you today.,false
4,Client,"Oh, yes, the lip piercing. Yeah.",false
4,Therapist,How long ago did you decide to get your lip pierced?,false
4,Client,About a month ago.,false
4,Therapist,Interesting. What inspired you to choose a lip piercing?,false
4,Client,"Honestly, I just wanted something different. I was feeling bored and thought it would be nice to stand out a bit.",false
4,Therapist,That makes sense. It certainly adds a unique touch.,false
4,Client,Thank you.,false
4,Therapist,"As your dentist, I do have some concerns about oral piercings affecting teeth or gums. Have you heard anything about potential impacts?",false
4,Client,"Not really. I suppose it might affect my gums or teeth, but I'm not sure how much of an impact it will have. My teeth are generally in good shape.",false
4,Therapist,That's reassuring to hear. You always have such beautiful teeth when you visit.,false
4,Client,[laughs] Thank you.,false
4,Therapist,"Some patients with oral piercings experience gum erosion, especially at the front. Additionally, I've seen a fair number of chipped teeth due to contact with the piercing. What are your thoughts on these possibilities?",false
4,Client,"I definitely don't want it to harm my teeth. I know my gums are already low, as you've mentioned before, and I need to floss more often, which I haven’t been doing.",false
4,Therapist,"Yes, flossing is important.",false
4,Client,"Right, but I really don't want to damage my teeth. So far, I haven't noticed any chipping.",false
4,Therapist,"There's no evidence of issues yet, and since you've only had it for a short time, that's good news.",false
4,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
4,Therapist,What would lead you to decide that the piercing isn’t suitable for you?,false
4,Client,"I suppose if I noticed any problems arising from it, then I might reconsider.",false
4,Therapist,That sounds like a reasonable approach. It does look quite stylish.,false
4,Client,"Yeah, I think so too.",false
4,Therapist,"So, you plan to keep an eye on how it affects your teeth and gums?",false
4,Client,"Yes, definitely. If any problems start to show up—my teeth are important to me—I hope they'll last a long time.",false
4,Therapist,"Emily, you put it well when you said the piercing might not be permanent, but your teeth should hopefully last forever.",false
4,Client,Yeah.,false
4,Therapist,"Thank you for discussing this with me. Before we proceed with the exam, I want to remind you about flossing regularly.",false
4,Client,Yeah.,false
126,Therapist,"Hello, Kaylie. I'm Lori, your pharmacist at Bulldog Pharmacy. It looks like you're here to pick up a cholesterol statin 20 prescription from Dr. Ferris today. Do you have a moment to discuss how best to take it and address any questions?",false
126,Client,"Sure, I’m just picking up some groceries.",false
126,Therapist,What did the doctor explain about why you need to take cholesterol statin?,false
126,Client,"He mentioned that my blood test showed high cholesterol levels, so he prescribed this medication for me.",false
126,Therapist,That's correct. This medicine is intended to help lower your cholesterol and reduce your risk of heart attack or stroke. Did Dr. Ferris provide any instructions on how you should take it?,false
126,Client,No specific instructions were given; he just called it in.,false
126,Therapist,"Understood. You'll need to take one tablet of cholesterol statin 20 once daily, either with food or without. When do you typically take your other medications?",false
126,Client,"I usually take all my medications right before bed, so that would work for me.",false
126,Therapist,"That's a great choice since this medication is most effective when taken at night, though it can be taken any time of day. Consistency in taking it daily is key. Where do you keep your medications?",false
126,Client,I store them all in my nightstand next to my bed.,false
126,Therapist,Do you have children living with you?,false
126,Client,"No, I don’t have any kids at home.",false
126,Therapist,"That sounds like a suitable place for storing your medications, as they should be kept away from light, heat, and moisture. Did Dr. Ferris mention anything about potential side effects?",false
126,Client,He didn't discuss any side effects with me.,false
126,Therapist,"This medication is generally well-tolerated, but you might experience mild muscle aches or pains. If these become severe, please contact Dr. Ferris. Additionally, cholesterol statin can interact with other medications and over-the-counter products, so it's important to consult your doctor or me before starting anything new. Also, grapefruit juice can affect how this medication works, so you might want to switch to another type of juice while taking it.",false
126,Therapist,"To ensure we're on the same page, could you summarize how you plan to take this medicine?",false
126,Client,I’ll take one tablet in the evening with my other medications. I'll also switch to orange juice and contact Dr. Ferris if I experience severe muscle pain.,false
126,Therapist,"That sounds perfect, Kaylie. We covered quite a bit today. Are there any other questions you have for me?",false
126,Client,You've answered all my questions. Thank you.,false
126,Therapist,"Wonderful. Here's your prescription, which is set up on auto-fill so it will be ready each month at the same time. If you have further questions later, feel free to call us using the number provided here. Thanks again, and have a great day!",false
123,Therapist,"I've completed your exam and have some updates for you. The good news is that there are no cavities, which is great.",false
123,Client,That's wonderful to hear.,false
123,Therapist,"However, I'm concerned about something I noticed in your mouth. If you look at the roof of your mouth, there's significant irritation consistent with tobacco use. You mentioned on your form that you don't use tobacco, so I'm curious what might be causing this.",false
123,Client,I've never smoked cigarettes.,false
123,Therapist,"Understood. Despite that, there's noticeable irritation here in the roof of your mouth—it has turned white with some red spots. This type of damage is typically seen only in tobacco users. Could you possibly be using pipes or cigars? Or might something else be contributing to this?",false
123,Client,"I've never smoked cigarettes, but when I go out with friends to lounges, sometimes they offer me those mini Swisher Sweets cigars—peach and grape flavors.",false
123,Therapist,"It's a common misconception that fruit-flavored ones are harmless. Unfortunately, they're quite harmful. Were you aware of this?",false
123,Client,"Really? But they're just small, cute little cigars.",false
123,Therapist,"Yes, but they're still tobacco products and carry the same risks as cigarettes—lung cancer, oral cancer, emphysema, among others. It's crucial to understand that.",false
123,Client,I only use them occasionally for relaxation; it's not like smoking 20 or 30 cigarettes a day. It's just when we go out.,false
123,Therapist,"At least you're not using them excessively, which is good. However, they are still causing significant harm. The damage in your mouth needs to be addressed. Have you considered quitting?",false
123,Client,I didn't realize it was such an issue; I thought it was more like social drinking.,false
123,Therapist,"So, do you plan to quit then?",false
123,Client,Perhaps.,false
123,Therapist,What do you mean by perhaps? You've been informed about the serious risks involved. It's crucial for your health that this stops.,false
123,Client,I'll need some time to think about it.,false
123,Therapist,"There doesn't seem much to ponder over, given how infrequent and risky it is.",false
123,Client,"It helps me relax, and since it's not frequent, maybe I could reduce my use.",false
123,Therapist,"Reducing might be a start, but quitting entirely would reverse the damage and eliminate health risks. Continuing with cigars still puts you in danger.",false
123,Client,"I don't see them as cigars; it's my choice to do what I want. I'll consider cutting back, but I'm not ready to quit yet. Plus, I'm skeptical about the severity of your warnings.",false
123,Therapist,"By continuing this habit, you're causing damage to your mouth and potentially affecting your teeth—they might be getting yellower. All forms of tobacco use have serious negative effects. This decision is important because it impacts your health significantly.",false
123,Client,I'll give it some thought.,false
123,Therapist,"Thank you for considering it. It's a significant issue, so please reflect deeply on it. I will continue to discuss this with you as it's crucial for your well-being.",false
132,Therapist,"Hello, Mr. Green. It's wonderful to see you again. Last week we reviewed your results and noted your impaired glucose tolerance, which raised some concerns about type two diabetes. Your blood pressure and cholesterol levels are also slightly elevated. Today, let's explore some lifestyle changes that might benefit your health. As you know, many factors influence well-being. Shall we have a general discussion on how things are going for you?",false
132,Client,I guess you're here to tell me it's all my fault and that I need to change everything I enjoy.,false
132,Therapist,"Actually, I'm not here to do that because the choices about your health are yours to make. You're in control of what steps you take next.",false
132,Client,The doctor mentioned I'll have to be on medication for life.,false
132,Therapist,It sounds like you might feel a bit uneasy about that.,false
132,Client,"Well, I feel okay now, but the doctor said it could save my life.",false
132,Therapist,"There are many actions you can take yourself to improve your situation. Today, we can discuss areas like smoking, diet, exercise, and weight management. Let's start with these topics and see how you're feeling as we go along.",false
132,Client,What should I tackle first?,false
132,Therapist,It's really up to you; you're in charge of your own life. Where would you prefer to begin?,false
132,Client,Do you have any suggestions on where I should start?,false
132,Therapist,"I can offer my perspective and provide information, but it seems like you already understand the situation quite well.",false
132,Client,"Yeah, you'd probably say stop smoking, lose weight, and exercise more, right?",false
132,Therapist,"Exactly. Quitting smoking would make a significant impact quickly. Losing weight would also be beneficial for your blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and diabetes risk. What are your thoughts on these suggestions?",false
132,Client,"I really want to lose weight, but it's challenging to give up the things I enjoy.",false
132,Therapist,It can indeed be difficult to know where to begin.,false
132,Client,"I should probably do it, or maybe not,",false
132,Therapist,How important is losing weight for you then?,false
132,Client,"Well, I'd like my children and grandchildren to have a stable future, and I want to set an example for them.",false
132,Therapist,So being there for your family is very significant to you?,false
132,Client,Yes. I want to be present for them without becoming a burden.,false
132,Therapist,Understood. Where do you think you could start with that in mind?,false
132,Client,"Lately, I've been thinking about my family more and realize I need to improve my health to be there for them.",false
132,Therapist,What might be the first step you'd consider taking?,false
132,Client,"To begin with, I could cut down on drinking. It's contributing to my weight gain and high blood pressure, right?",false
132,Therapist,"Yes, that would indeed be a great starting point.",false
132,Client,"Actually, I think I'll try cutting out alcohol altogether. My wife has mentioned it's too much during the weekends.",false
132,Therapist,That sounds like a supportive decision for your health goals.,false
132,Client,And maybe I could stop eating crisps and pies at work as well.,false
132,Therapist,How might you manage hunger at work without those snacks?,false
132,Client,"I plan to have soup for lunch instead. A big bowl of soup would be healthier than two pies, right?",false
132,Therapist,Absolutely. A large serving of vegetable soup can count towards your daily fruit and veg intake. It's a great way to start. Are there any other changes you're considering?,false
132,Client,One thing I've already done is stop adding salt to my meals. The doctor said it would help with blood pressure.,false
132,Therapist,"That's excellent progress, and it might have already had some positive effects. Did you know that reducing salt can also decrease calcium loss from bones, making them stronger? So cutting down on salt helps in more ways than one.",false
132,Client,I wasn't aware of that. It's good to learn. I'll share this with my wife; she loves her salt and her mother had osteoporosis.,false
132,Therapist,"Perhaps you can help your wife too by sharing what you've learned. That would be beneficial for both of you. You've made a fantastic start, Mr. Green. You're well aware of the steps needed, and it seems like you have some solid plans in place. Next time we meet, we could discuss smoking and exercise when you feel ready. How do you feel now?",false
132,Client,"If I stick to my plan of cutting down on pies, crisps, and alcohol, I feel like I'm making progress. Let's take it one step at a time and see how things improve.",false
132,Therapist,That sounds great. Shall we schedule our next meeting for the same time next week?,false
132,Client,"Yes, that works for me.",false
132,Therapist,Excellent. All the best until then.,false
132,Client,Thank you. You too.,false
16,Therapist,"Rick, let's revisit your current living situation with Tristan. We've discussed how this program and your parents' support can be beneficial for you. Could we explore the advantages and disadvantages of continuing to live with him? What are some positive aspects, as well as potential challenges?",false
16,Client,"It’s a nice place, close to work, and it's great to have a friend there.",false
16,Therapist,"I understand that having supportive company is important, especially when you're working on making these changes.",false
16,Client,Yes.,false
16,Therapist,What are your thoughts about this support in relation to the changes you want to make?,false
16,Client,"That’s exactly what I’m trying to figure out. I'm not sure if living there is conducive to the changes I need to make, even though Tristan is a good flatmate.",false
16,Therapist,I see.,false
16,Client,"We're heading in different directions now. He doesn't have the same responsibilities as I do, and I can’t expect him to change his life just because I want to change mine.",false
16,Therapist,That makes sense.,false
16,Client,I'm also uncertain about moving in with my aunt and uncle.,false
16,Therapist,It's good that you're open to exploring options. How much does Tristan know about the changes you’re planning? What has he shared with you?,false
16,Client,"We've had conversations where I asked for his support, and he says he'll be there for me. But as I mentioned, he’s at a different stage in life than I am.",false
16,Therapist,Understood.,false
16,Client,"He doesn’t have kids, so it might be hard for him to fully grasp what this means for me. Still, he's a good friend.",false
16,Therapist,Let’s consider the pros and cons of moving in with your aunt and uncle. What do you think?,false
16,Client,"The food would be great, and my family is very supportive. However, I'm concerned about losing my independence. I worry they might take over or that I won't have as much freedom to manage myself.",false
16,Therapist,"Balancing this sense of independence with the changes we're discussing, including reconnecting with your family and children, how do you see managing these aspects? Is maintaining some level of freedom important for you?",false
16,Client,I wouldn’t want to hold onto that freedom if it means losing my kids. I'm just concerned that even with good intentions from my family—,false
16,Therapist,I understand.,false
16,Client,—I’ll do anything to get my kids back.,false
7,Therapist,I understand that you sprained your ankle yesterday. Could you share more about how it happened?,false
7,Client,"It's really silly, actually. We were on a pub crawl last night, and as usual, there was drinking involved. I thought catching up with my friends who were ahead of me was a good idea, so I jumped off the bus stairs while wearing stilettos for the 90s theme. Then I fell and hurt my ankle—it was quite embarrassing.",false
7,Therapist,That sounds like an adventurous evening.,false
7,Client,"Yes, it was fun but I couldn't dance afterward.",false
7,Therapist,No doubt that would put a damper on your dancing plans. I'm curious if you'd be open to discussing how alcohol fits into your weekly routine?,false
7,Client,"Sure, as long as we don't dwell too much on vodka—I'm still feeling its effects a bit—",false
7,Therapist,You're still experiencing the aftereffects from last night?,false
7,Client,A little.,false
7,Therapist,It sounds like it was quite an intense night for you.,false
7,Client,"Well, it's pretty normal for me.",false
7,Therapist,Could you describe what a typical week looks like regarding your alcohol consumption?,false
7,Client,"My friends and I usually party on weekends. As university students, having a few drinks is just part of the norm.",false
7,Therapist,So drinking a bit isn't unusual for you?,false
7,Client,"No, not at all.",false
7,Therapist,"What does ""a few drinks"" mean to you? Is it per night or something else?",false
7,Client,"Per night. If we're out and about, I can easily have seven or eight drinks if I'm going hard. And after a long day at the library, maybe two beers when I get home.",false
7,Therapist,Do you have any concerns regarding your alcohol use?,false
7,Client,Not really—I think it's typical for university students like me.,false
7,Therapist,"So right now, you don't see anything concerning about what you're doing compared to other students?",false
7,Client,Yeah.,false
7,Therapist,Would you be open to looking at the low-risk drinking guidelines together?,false
7,Client,Sure.,false
7,Therapist,"I'm curious how you feel today, but let's quickly review these guidelines. For women, it suggests up to 10 drinks per week, with no more than two drinks on any given day.",false
7,Client,Really?,false
7,Therapist,Yes.,false
7,Client,Wow.,false
7,Therapist,Where do you see yourself in relation to those numbers?,false
7,Client,"I'd say a bit over that, especially with midterms coming up.",false
7,Therapist,So it's a way for you to manage stress?,false
7,Client,"Yeah, I guess so.",false
7,Therapist,Has this been your method of coping for some time now?,false
7,Client,"Yes, I suppose.",false
7,Therapist,Does that concern you in any way?,false
7,Client,"Well, 10 drinks doesn't seem like much given my tolerance. I've built it up over the years, which is a bit concerning to me.",false
7,Therapist,Do you see reasons for possibly reducing your alcohol intake within those limits?,false
7,Client,"Any reason? Health concerns, perhaps.",false
7,Therapist,Could you elaborate on that?,false
7,Client,"Clearly, I don't feel great right now. When I'm not hungover, I'm definitely more productive. So there's a benefit to cutting back.",false
7,Therapist,It sounds like reducing your drinking could have some advantages for you during the week?,false
7,Client,Yes.,false
7,Therapist,Would you be open to exploring this further with me at another time when you're feeling better?,false
7,Client,"Yeah, I think so—maybe after a less intense night than last one.",false
7,Therapist,I'd like to schedule an appointment for later this week or early next week to delve into this more and discuss the benefits of staying within safe limits. Would that work for you?,false
7,Client,"Sure, just not on a Saturday morning. [chuckles]",false
7,Therapist,That's perfectly fine with me.,false
7,Client,Okay.,false
7,Therapist,Thank you.,false
7,Client,Sounds good.,false
10,Therapist,"Hi. May I have your name, please?",false
10,Client,Yeah.,false
10,Therapist,Great to meet you. What brings you here today?,false
10,Client,"Well, I need to learn how to manage my diabetes since I was just diagnosed.",false
10,Therapist,I understand. It sounds like your A1C or blood glucose levels are quite high.,false
10,Client,"Yes, that's what the doctor told me. She really emphasized its seriousness, mentioning risks like losing eyesight and foot problems, among other things. It scared me a lot. So, learning how to manage everything seems overwhelming.",false
10,Therapist,"I hear your concern. Managing diabetes will involve taking medication, adjusting your diet, losing weight, changing eating habits, and exercising. Your doctor is right; it's serious, but we can work through this together.",false
10,Client,"It feels like a lot to handle, and I'm not sure if I can manage all of that. Plus, the consequences are frightening if I don't succeed.",false
10,Therapist,"Yes, it certainly can be daunting. But by addressing these areas step-by-step, we can help get your diabetes under control since your numbers indicate urgency.",false
10,Client,[sighs],false
10,Therapist,We'll take this one step at a time and explore ways to manage each aspect effectively.,false
10,Client,"Well, I-I [unintelligible 00:01:35]",false
13,Therapist,"Hello, Mrs. Smith. I wanted to inform you that during today's appointment, we plan to administer some vaccines for Lilly.",false
13,Client,"Oh, I'm a bit unsure about that. Lately, I've been reading quite a lot of information regarding them.",false
13,Therapist,That sounds concerning. Could you share more about what specifically worries you about the vaccines?,false
13,Client,"Yes, well, I was thinking it might be better to let their immunity develop naturally within their bodies.",false
13,Therapist,"So, you're considering that allowing Lily to build her immunity naturally could be a preferable option over using vaccines for strengthening her health?",false
13,Client,"Exactly. After all, I had chickenpox as a child and now have natural immunity, right?",false
13,Therapist,"Yes, having chickenpox in childhood typically means you develop natural immunity, reducing the likelihood of contracting it again as an adult. Would it be alright if I provided some additional information about the other vaccines we planned for Lilly today?",false
13,Client,"Sure, go ahead.",false
13,Therapist,"Before vaccines were available, children who naturally contracted these diseases sometimes faced severe consequences—such as death or disability. For instance, measles could lead to brain damage and result in deafness or blindness, while polio often caused paralysis in children. Allowing natural exposure was quite risky at times.",false
13,Client,"Wow, I wasn't aware of how dangerous it could be. I've never even heard about polio before.",false
13,Therapist,"It seems some of these diseases are unfamiliar to you because we've been successful in eradicating them, making many people your age and mine unaware of their impact. With this information shared, what are your thoughts on vaccinating Lilly?",false
13,Client,"Well, I suppose it's fine. Ultimately, I just want her to be healthy and safe.",false
13,Therapist,It's clear that ensuring her safety and making informed decisions is very important to you when considering medical choices for her.,false
13,Client,"Yes, I just want to make sure I'm doing what's best.",false
25,Therapist,"Liz, what's something you're considering changing or feeling ambivalent about at the moment?",false
25,Client,I really want to start working out again. Definitely want to establish a routine and just be healthier.,false
25,Therapist,What motivates you to make this change?,false
25,Client,"I'm tired of how I feel—sluggish, especially with winter approaching. I'd like more energy.",false
25,Therapist,I see.,false
25,Client,"Plus, my clothes don't fit the way I want them to.",false
25,Therapist,I understand.,false
25,Client,It just makes me uncomfortable overall.,false
25,Therapist,So you're feeling discomfort because your clothes aren't fitting as you'd like?,false
25,Client,Yes.,false
25,Therapist,What are some benefits of making this change for you?,false
25,Client,"Exercise has always made me feel good in the past. It boosts my self-esteem and general well-being. I want to set a positive example for my kids, showing them that exercise is part of life.",false
25,Therapist,I hear you.,false
25,Client,"So, I really want to get back into a routine.",false
25,Therapist,You're looking to feel healthier for yourself and be a good role model for your children?,false
25,Client,Yes.,false
25,Therapist,"If you decide to incorporate more exercise into your daily routine, how might you go about it?",false
25,Client,"I'd probably need to sit down with my husband to find a suitable time when he can watch the kids while I work out—maybe mornings or evenings, or on weekends. We'll have to figure out what fits our schedule.",false
25,Therapist,I see.,false
25,Client,It's about finding that balance so it doesn't disrupt our family routine too much.,false
25,Therapist,"So you're aiming for a balance between personal time and maintaining your family routine. On a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 is not important and 10 is very important, how would you rate the importance of starting to exercise more?",false
25,Client,I'd say it's about a seven or eight.,false
25,Therapist,Why not a five or six?,false
25,Client,"Because I'm really tired of being overweight. I don't like feeling unhealthy—it doesn't make me feel good—and I'm motivated to change, even though getting started is challenging.",false
25,Therapist,"So, in summary, it's important for you because you're feeling sluggish and unhealthy, and you want to be a positive role model for your family. However, you're finding the logistics of scheduling time for yourself without disrupting your family routine a bit tricky?",false
25,Client,Exactly.,false
25,Therapist,"Knowing this, what do you think will be your next step?",false
25,Client,I might start by planning walks or runs on days when it's still nice outside. Maybe look for a gym nearby that has daycare facilities so I can go easily and quickly. I'll explore these options to find ways to fit exercise into my life.,false
25,Therapist,That sounds like a solid plan. You've identified some practical steps to help you get started.,false
25,Client,Yes.,false
28,Therapist,"Hi Carrie, I'm glad you could make it today.",false
28,Client,"Thank you, my doctor referred me here.",false
28,Therapist,What brings you in today?,false
28,Client,"Well, I've been struggling with smoking and trying to quit for a while now.",false
28,Therapist,"So, you're interested in quitting cigarettes?",false
28,Client,"Yes, I've wanted to do that for many years.",false
28,Therapist,It sounds like it's an important goal for you. Can you tell me more about why quitting is so significant at this point in your life?,false
28,Client,"My 15-year-old daughter strongly disapproves of smoking, and my health issues are becoming a concern—I'm not getting any younger, I have asthma and chronic bronchitis, which makes it hard to breathe when exercising. Plus, it's socially frowned upon.",false
28,Therapist,It seems like being a smoker feels isolating in today's society.,false
28,Client,"Actually, it feels more like being an outcast among non-outcasts.",false
28,Therapist,"So, finding a place where smoking is accepted seems impossible these days. Being a good mother and setting a positive example for your daughter at this age must be really important to you.",false
28,Client,"Yes, exactly. She's embarrassed when I smoke around her friends, which reflects poorly on me too.",false
28,Therapist,It sounds like you want to look good in her eyes and be someone she can be proud of. Quitting smoking would add to that positive image.,false
28,Client,"Right, yes.",false
28,Therapist,"You mentioned several health concerns—asthma, acute bronchitis, and emphysema—are those correct?",false
28,Client,"Yes, I'm also starting to experience early stages of emphysema.",false
28,Therapist,That sounds really concerning. Can you share when you were diagnosed with these conditions?,false
28,Client,"It's hard to pinpoint exactly, but I remember being unable to breathe well in humid weather when my daughter was five. She called 911 because she thought I might die.",false
28,Therapist,Your daughter must be very smart and caring.,false
28,Client,"Yes, she is intelligent. They brought me home on a stretcher while she panicked, thinking she'd lost her mother.",false
28,Therapist,That sounds like a frightening experience for both of you. You mentioned trying Chantix—can you tell me more about that?,false
28,Client,"I'm not sure if it's my willpower or the side effects, but they were really bad.",false
28,Therapist,What kind of side effects did you experience with Chantix?,false
28,Client,"I had nightmares, nausea, stomach problems, and agitation.",false
28,Therapist,"Those sound quite severe. Some people do find success with it, but when side effects occur, they can be very pronounced.",false
28,Client,"Right, and it didn't even help me quit smoking.",false
28,Therapist,It sounds like Chantix wasn't the right fit for you. How long ago did you try it?,false
28,Client,About two to three years ago. I tried a few times but kept getting new prescriptions hoping it would work this time.,false
28,Therapist,Did you ever consider joining their support group online or by phone?,false
28,Client,"No, that wasn't something I pursued.",false
28,Therapist,"It seems like Chantix didn't align with your needs, especially given the side effects. You listened to what your body was telling you.",false
28,Client,"Yes, and being in menopause adds more stress than I need right now.",false
28,Therapist,"It sounds like you're already dealing with a lot of stress, so adding something that makes you feel worse isn't helpful. You're looking for relief instead.",false
28,Client,Exactly.,false
28,Therapist,Have there been times when you managed to quit smoking completely?,false
28,Client,"Only in the hospital, but I'd sneak out and smoke anyway.",false
28,Therapist,"What's the longest period you've gone without a cigarette, including your time in the hospital?",false
28,Client,Three days is the longest.,false
28,Therapist,That's quite an accomplishment. How did those three days feel for you?,false
28,Client,"My mind was constantly thinking about smoking, like how a chocoholic craves chocolate.",false
28,Therapist,It sounds like the craving was very strong. What happened when you finally smoked again?,false
28,Client,I didn't care what brand it was; I just needed that cigarette because of the nicotine and psychological need.,false
28,Therapist,"So, smoking seems to be tied to many aspects of your routine, like having coffee. How do you think about enjoying a cup of coffee without a cigarette?",false
28,Client,It's hard to imagine separating them.,false
28,Therapist,"Cigarettes can become intertwined with various activities, making it challenging to break the habit. They're often described as an almost perfect drug because they meet different needs at any time, though they have significant health downsides.",false
28,Client,Really?,false
28,Therapist,"Yes, unfortunately, smoking typically reduces life expectancy by about 10 years or more.",false
28,Client,My aunt always says it's like putting another nail in my coffin.,false
28,Therapist,How do you feel when she tells you that?,false
28,Client,"I think of her as a bit cocky. She was my role model and seemed glamorous back then, but now it feels like I'm being ostracized for the same habit.",false
28,Therapist,It's interesting how perceptions have changed over time. Smoking wasn't seen this way 20 or even 30 years ago.,false
28,Client,That's true.,false
28,Therapist,"Nowadays, smoking can lead to negative assumptions about you.",false
28,Client,"Yes, and finding a place to smoke often requires traveling far, especially if I only have a short break at work.",false
28,Therapist,So it seems like the logistics of smoking are becoming increasingly difficult for you.,false
28,Client,"Exactly, it's not practical anymore.",false
22,Therapist,"I see you completed your values clarification handout, which is what we wanted to discuss today. Could you share with me some of your top five values?",false
22,Client,"Yes, my foremost value is family happiness—it's especially important now. I usually revisit this values sheet every couple of months—",false
22,Therapist,Mm-hmm.,false
22,Client,"—to check if anything has shifted, and it often does.",false
22,Therapist,"So currently, the value of family holds the utmost importance for you?",false
22,Client,Yes.,false
22,Therapist,Family happiness is your top priority?,false
22,Client,"Yes, because it feels a bit lacking right now. It's something I know is very important to me.",false
22,Therapist,Would you like to explore that further?,false
22,Client,"Sure. My family hasn't been in sync lately, so if we could all find some common ground—though not everyone follows the same path—I think my role is to be more present and listen, understand my family members, and express how crucial family happiness is to me.",false
22,Therapist,So perhaps they aren’t aware of just how important this value is to you?,false
22,Client,Yes.,false
22,Therapist,And you want them to recognize its significance for you?,false
22,Client,"I do. Especially now, I revisit this every few months to reflect on where I stand.",false
22,Therapist,Uh-huh.,false
22,Client,These values are different from what I usually choose—,false
22,Therapist,Okay.,false
22,Client,"—and my second value is religion. It was initially number one until a significant family event made me question my faith, which is normal. In my church community, it's like losing touch with God makes you the devil.",false
22,Therapist,Uh-huh.,false
22,Client,"But we all face challenges daily; we're not perfect. My faith remains, and as long as it does, that’s what matters to me.",false
22,Therapist,"So right now, prioritizing family values is essential for you, while religion still holds importance but feels a bit distant?",false
22,Client,"Yes, I've lost some faith, and I'm open about it.",false
22,Therapist,Uh-huh.,false
22,Client,Because others experience this too.,false
22,Therapist,You know it's normal to feel that way.,false
22,Client,"I do. It’s just not something people often talk about, especially in the church.",false
22,Therapist,Especially within religious communities.,false
22,Client,"Yes, it shocks them when you express such doubts. But we all go through phases of uncertainty—I still have faith, though it's a journey. The positive aspects of my life remind me to be thankful and maintain my faith, even if I sometimes wonder where God is.",false
22,Therapist,Yeah.,false
22,Client,And I've reached a place of acceptance about that too.,false
22,Therapist,"So you understand it’s okay for your feelings to fluctuate, knowing they will change based on past experiences?",false
22,Client,Yes.,false
22,Therapist,You’ve noticed changes in your values over time with each handout—,false
22,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
22,Therapist,—so you accept that these shifts are natural?,false
22,Client,"I have. Initially, I was surprised by the differences between my first and second attempts—after completing five of them—I focused too much on comparing them rather than embracing change.",false
22,Therapist,It's commendable how open-minded you've become to understand that your current state doesn't have to be permanent.,false
22,Client,"Yes, at first, I wondered if it was normal. But then I realized people experience changes daily, and life is dynamic.",false
22,Therapist,Mm-hmm.,false
22,Client,"Life evolves with each new day; my perspective has broadened significantly. Now, I don’t resist change—I embrace it and focus on what truly matters.",false
22,Therapist,All right.,false
22,Client,"That way, I can concentrate more on the meaningful aspects of life rather than unnecessary distractions.",false
22,Therapist,"Do you feel there are areas in your life where aligning with your values is a challenge, or do you think you're mostly aligned?",false
22,Client,"I mentioned earlier that it felt off because when I did this particular exercise, while the other three were important to me, I hadn't focused on them much. So, I acknowledged their importance but lost track of those and the others—",false
22,Therapist,The other values?,false
22,Client,"Number three is health, number four is inner harmony, and number five is security.",false
22,Therapist,"Inner harmony, health, and security are your other values?",false
22,Client,Yes.,false
22,Therapist,And family happiness and religion top the list?,false
22,Client,Exactly.,false
22,Therapist,It seems you might not be giving these three as much attention as you'd like?,false
22,Client,"Right. When I reviewed them, it was clear they were important to me, but—",false
22,Therapist,Is it because your time is largely consumed by family and religious commitments?,false
22,Client,"Yes, especially the first one—family—and learning about self-esteem has led me to focus more on others.",false
22,Therapist,So you've been prioritizing family so much that you’ve neglected yourself a bit?,false
22,Client,Exactly. Most of my time goes toward everything else but myself.,false
22,Therapist,Achieving inner harmony might be challenging if you're constantly attending to everyone else's needs.,false
22,Client,"And I believe inner harmony starts with sleep, which has been elusive lately. [laughter]",false
22,Therapist,Right.,false
22,Client,"But that’s the first step. Still, it feels overwhelming at times, but I want to regain my sense of inner peace because when I was 18, life felt like a fairy tale.",false
22,Therapist,Mm-hmm.,false
22,Client,Then reality hit hard and shifted my focus entirely onto others.,false
22,Therapist,So something significant happened that disrupted your carefree lifestyle?,false
22,Client,Yes. It’s been quite the shock.,false
22,Therapist,"I'm glad we had this time to discuss your values. I hope it's been helpful, and if you'd like support in bringing more attention to those other values next time, we can explore that.",false
22,Client,Thank you for listening.,false
22,Therapist,You're welcome.,false
19,Therapist,It sounds like you're feeling frustrated with this situation.,false
19,Client,"Yes, I am. I just can't keep shoplifting anymore. I got caught again and ended up suspended from school. Now, I'm worried that if I don’t stop, it could ruin everything for me here.",false
19,Therapist,That must be really tough to deal with.,false
19,Client,"It is. My friends and I enjoy it, but at the same time, I know it's not right. I need to make a change, even though I'm unsure how to go about it.",false
19,Therapist,You seem determined to make this change.,false
19,Client,Absolutely. I want to stop doing this.,false
19,Therapist,"It sounds like you're ready to take that step, but finding the way forward might be challenging.",false
19,Client,Exactly. I don't know what my next move should be. My friends are part of the problem—they’re not good influences—but they're still my friends.,false
19,Therapist,That must make it difficult for you.,false
19,Client,"It does. And, honestly, there's nothing else that feels as exciting or fun as this. We go in and steal CDs, and it was working out fine until now—",false
19,Therapist,I see how that could be appealing to you.,false
40,Client,I'm doing pretty well. It's been three months now.,false
40,Therapist,That sounds like a positive step forward.,false
40,Client,"Um, and—",false
40,Therapist,"Since you haven't used meth since our last session, right?",false
40,Client,Right.,false
40,Therapist,Okay.,false
40,Client,"Yes, it has indeed been three months, and I've managed to maintain my progress.",false
40,Therapist,That's great to hear.,false
40,Client,"Um, and I've also met a couple of new friends.",false
40,Therapist,That sounds like a positive development.,false
40,Client,So—,false
40,Therapist,"Last time we spoke, you mentioned distancing yourself from your ex-boyfriend because he was involved in supplying drugs. How has that been going for you?",false
40,Client,"Yes, it's been good. I haven't picked up the phone when he calls, and I've also ignored a few other friends who tried to reach out.",false
40,Therapist,Okay.,false
40,Client,"-and by reaching out to new people in my neighborhood, it’s been beneficial for me.",false
40,Therapist,"It seems like you're making some significant changes—adjusting your environment, altering certain behaviors, and forming connections with these new friends.",false
40,Client,"Yes, the new friendships have been helpful. I've also been practicing the breathing exercises you taught me whenever I start feeling stressed. They help a lot; going for walks while doing them calms me down and helps me manage those moments.",false
40,Therapist,It sounds like—,false
34,Therapist,"Thank you for joining me today, Nina. I'm eager to learn more about you and understand what led you here.",false
34,Client,My doctor referred me. He mentioned that I've been a bit irresponsible during my pregnancy. Yes.,false
34,Therapist,It sounds like your doctor is concerned about some of the choices you've made recently.,false
34,Client,"Yes, he said I was drinking too much. I haven't done it excessively, but he thinks it might cause problems.",false
34,Therapist,You seem worried that these actions could affect your baby.,false
34,Client,"Exactly. I don’t want to harm my baby in any way, but I'm scared I may have already done so.",false
34,Therapist,So you're concerned about the potential impact and deeply care about providing the best start for your baby.,false
34,Client,"Yes, that's right.",false
34,Therapist,And you're curious about what we'll explore together during our sessions?,false
34,Client,Yes. He didn't give me much detail; he just said to come see you.,false
34,Therapist,"So today, you've shared with me that you've been drinking alcohol throughout your pregnancy.",false
34,Client,"Yes. I only found out I was pregnant two months in and had already started drinking then. It's tough because my friends party on weekends, and it’s hard to break away from that habit.",false
34,Therapist,You're feeling the pressure from people close to you to continue participating in those social activities.,false
34,Client,"A bit. If I talked to them about it, they might understand, but it feels strange since I'm the only one among my friends who's having a baby and they don't know how to react.",false
34,Therapist,It seems like you're caught between two worlds—one where you're preparing for motherhood and another where you've been enjoying yourself with your friends.,false
34,Client,Yes.,false
34,Therapist,"In this party world, do you feel ready to transition into the mom role, or is there still a part of you that wants to stay?",false
34,Client,There's a part of me that still wants to enjoy my current lifestyle because I won't have another chance once the baby arrives. I know changes are inevitable.,false
34,Therapist,"So while your baby is with you, you're thinking it might be possible to balance both worlds, but perhaps deep down, you feel it’s time to fully embrace motherhood?",false
34,Client,Probably. And I'm also feeling like it's too late; I may have already caused harm.,false
34,Therapist,You have concerns about the effects of your drinking so far. What do you understand about alcohol consumption during pregnancy?,false
34,Client,"I know they advise against it, but since my friends didn't seem concerned, I thought maybe it wasn’t a big deal. Like general advice on drinking might not always apply.",false
34,Therapist,"It seems like because your friends weren’t urging you to stop, you assumed it was acceptable.",false
34,Client,Yes.,false
34,Therapist,Yet there's another part of you that sensed it might be wrong.,false
34,Client,"Exactly, I should have trusted my instincts.",false
34,Therapist,What is your intuition telling you?,false
34,Client,It’s saying what I'm doing could harm my baby and that I'll regret it once the baby arrives.,false
34,Therapist,You want to do what's best for your child. How are you thinking about moving forward from here? Are you considering completely stopping drinking?,false
34,Client,"I think I can stop, but it becomes difficult in social situations with friends who are drinking. I don't want to be seen as the mom at that moment.",false
34,Therapist,It sounds like you're navigating a dual identity—wanting to maintain your current self while also preparing for motherhood.,false
34,Client,"Yes, and many people change completely after having kids, which I don’t want. I don’t want to lose my friends or pressure them to change because they’re good people.",false
34,Therapist,You care about them deeply.,false
34,Client,Yes.,false
34,Therapist,It seems like their lifestyle hasn't changed as much as yours has with this new chapter in your life.,false
34,Client,"Yeah, it feels that way. I don’t want to lose my friends or put pressure on them because of the changes happening for me.",false
34,Therapist,You're torn between wanting a baby and not being sure about completely changing your lifestyle. You’re uncertain about embracing a traditional family setting.,false
34,Client,"No, I don't want that.",false
34,Therapist,But you do want this baby.,false
34,Client,Yes.,false
34,Therapist,And you intend to be responsible for your child as they grow.,false
34,Client,I want to ensure I'm taking care of my baby properly.,false
34,Therapist,"You're determined not to let your baby down. At the same time, it's challenging to leave behind past habits, but you feel compelled to change now.",false
34,Client,"Yes, that’s how it feels. I think I've already made some poor choices regarding this situation.",false
34,Therapist,"Nina, what are your hopes for the future? When you look ahead from where you stand today, what do you envision?",false
34,Client,Keeping the baby was a sign for me to step up and become more responsible. It's daunting because sometimes I still feel like a teenager. I want to raise my child well without regrets about this decision.,false
34,Therapist,"You see your baby as an opportunity for a new chapter in life, almost like a second chance or plan B that you both can shape together.",false
34,Client,"Yes, but it’s easier said than done. It's hard to change who I am overnight.",false
34,Therapist,"While the baby represents this fresh start, there's a part of you that still identifies with your past lifestyle and wonders if you're ready for this new path.",false
34,Client,"Exactly. And sometimes it feels like I don't deserve this second chance, even though another part of me wants to embrace it.",false
34,Therapist,You have people around you pulling you back into old habits while the baby is a reminder of the life ahead. How confident are you in choosing this new path and successfully raising your child?,false
34,Client,I need to be successful because my child depends on it. There's no other option for me but to take that path.,false
34,Therapist,What makes you feel compelled to choose this path? What drives that necessity?,false
34,Client,"It’s essential for my child’s well-being. If I don’t make these changes, things could go wrong.",false
34,Therapist,This part of you feels there's no choice but to improve your life. Are you confident in making this new reality possible? What might help boost your confidence?,false
34,Client,"Maybe if my friends saw the baby and understood why this is important, it would give them a wake-up call too.",false
34,Therapist,So you think seeing your child might help your friends understand there's another path for them as well?,false
34,Client,Or at least they'll feel less pressure to conform to who I used to be.,false
34,Therapist,It sounds like you're navigating between two worlds.,false
34,Client,"A little bit, yes.",false
34,Therapist,Balancing the reminder of your baby’s arrival with maintaining friendships is challenging. Who in your circle could support you as you move toward this new path?,false
34,Client,"Definitely my parents, and I think meeting other young parents might help me see how it's done since I don't have anyone close to that stage.",false
34,Therapist,"Your parents are supportive of you giving up drinking, which is something they would encourage.",false
34,Client,"They probably aren’t aware of the extent of my drinking. If they found out, they’d be upset.",false
34,Therapist,That’s a concern for both them and you now.,false
34,Client,Yes.,false
34,Therapist,Would you consider meeting with me again to discuss how to have these conversations with your family and friends about moving forward on this new path?,false
34,Client,"I think so. Telling my parents is the hardest part, and talking to my friends feels awkward right now.",false
34,Therapist,It seems like a daunting task.,false
34,Client,"Yes, it's overwhelming without any guidance.",false
34,Therapist,You're worried they might treat you as if you’re lecturing them.,false
34,Client,Both my parents and my friends. I don’t want that dynamic.,false
34,Therapist,You wish to maintain peer relationships rather than take on a parental role with your friends.,false
34,Client,"Yes, I want to stay friends without losing their support.",false
34,Therapist,You don't want to lose your support network; you just want them to back you in leading a healthier life while raising your child. It sounds like you're seeking balance between these worlds.,false
34,Client,"Exactly, if there's a way to find that balance—",false
34,Therapist,You seem to desire the best of both worlds—maintaining friendships and avoiding the party scene.,false
34,Client,"Yes, I can't completely cut off my friends.",false
34,Therapist,"Nina, you know your world best. I'm here to support you in making these choices and having those conversations. Let's continue this discussion in our next session. Before we wrap up today, are there any steps you're willing to consider regarding your drinking?",false
34,Client,"Yes, I realize I need to stop now. But I also wonder if it’s already too late.",false
34,Therapist,"You’re concerned about your baby’s health. Every day without alcohol is beneficial for your baby, and starting today with no more alcohol is a positive step. Would you be open to this change?",false
34,Client,"Yes, I have to do it.",false
34,Therapist,It sounds like this is very important to you. Is there anything else I can support you with before we conclude today regarding stopping drinking now?,false
34,Client,Just knowing that it's not too late already gives me the motivation to start.,false
34,Therapist,"You've had a reality check today, and I appreciate your openness in sharing your thoughts with me. Thank you for trusting me with this conversation.",false
46,Therapist,"Jacob, your physical exam results look normal. Do you have any questions for me?",false
46,Client,No.,false
46,Therapist,Alright. I noticed you completed our alcohol and drug questionnaire. Would it be okay if we review this together now?,false
46,Client,Sure.,false
46,Therapist,Great. Everything we discuss is confidential. I'll only inform your parents with your permission or if there's a concern about potential harm to yourself or others. Does that make sense?,false
46,Client,Yeah.,false
46,Therapist,"Let's go through it then. It seems you've indicated occasional alcohol use, particularly for relaxation and socializing. Could you share more about how often you drink and in what situations?",false
46,Client,"It's not a big deal. Sometimes with my friends, we'll have a few beers or rum and cokes when we're hanging out or at parties.",false
46,Therapist,I see. How many drinks do you typically have during these occasions?,false
46,Client,"Um, three or four, probably. I don't keep track.",false
46,Therapist,And how frequently does this happen?,false
46,Client,"Um, about once or twice a month.",false
46,Therapist,"So, you enjoy drinking with friends, usually having three to four beers or mixed drinks one or two times a month. How long has this been going on?",false
46,Client,Probably since last October.,false
46,Therapist,That's around six months. What do you find enjoyable about drinking alcohol?,false
46,Client,What do I like about it?,false
46,Therapist,"Yes, what aspects of it appeal to you?",false
46,Client,"Um, it's just fun to drink with my friends at parties or when we're visiting someone else's house and meeting new people. It tastes good.",false
46,Therapist,"So, drinking seems to help you relax and enjoy time with your friends while also appealing to your taste buds.",false
46,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
46,Therapist,I'm curious if there are any aspects of your alcohol use that you find less enjoyable?,false
46,Client,"Um, I don't like getting sick from hangovers or throwing up. That's not fun at all.",false
46,Therapist,"Have you ever experienced a blackout after drinking, where you wake up and can't remember what happened?",false
46,Client,"No, but it happened to someone I know.",false
46,Therapist,"Okay. Have there been any issues related to your drinking, like problems at home or school?",false
46,Client,"Um, once I missed the first period of school because of a hangover and was late getting up.",false
46,Therapist,Mm-hmm.,false
46,Client,My mom got upset with me for not getting out of bed on time. She knew it was a hangover.,false
46,Therapist,Have you discussed your drinking habits with your mother?,false
46,Client,"No, but I ended up being grounded for two weeks after that. [chuckles]",false
46,Therapist,So there have been some negative consequences like trouble with your mom and missing school due to hangovers?,false
46,Client,"Yeah, but it was just once.",false
46,Therapist,Alright. The questionnaire also shows you've avoided riding in a car with someone who's been drinking or driving after drinking yourself. Is that correct?,false
46,Client,Yeah.,false
46,Therapist,"That's excellent. I hope you continue making those safe choices. As your doctor, I'm concerned about the risks of teen drinking, including potential injuries and its impact on your developing brain. Even moderate drinking can affect your brain development significantly.",false
46,Client,Okay.,false
46,Therapist,"For this reason, I recommend that all my adolescent patients abstain from alcohol entirely. On a scale from zero to ten, where zero means not ready at all and ten means very ready, how prepared do you feel to stop drinking?",false
46,Client,"Um, probably a five.",false
46,Therapist,"A five? Could you share why you didn't choose a lower number like two or three, which would suggest less readiness to stop drinking?",false
46,Client,"Well, I guess I'm just tired of getting in trouble.",false
46,Therapist,That makes sense. What steps could you take to avoid these troubles?,false
46,Client,"Um, not drink.",false
46,Therapist,[chuckles] Have you ever tried abstaining from alcohol before?,false
46,Client,"No, not really.",false
46,Therapist,Some people your age try taking a break from drinking for a while just to see how it feels. Would that be something you could consider?,false
46,Client,I could probably do that.,false
46,Therapist,How long do you think you could go without drinking?,false
46,Client,I don't know.,false
46,Therapist,Do you believe you could manage two months without alcohol?,false
46,Client,"Yeah, probably.",false
46,Therapist,What would make it easier for you to avoid drinking?,false
46,Client,"Um, I could just have something else like coke when my friends are drinking.",false
46,Therapist,Are there any other strategies that might help you in this situation?,false
46,Client,"I can hang out with some of my friends who don't drink or invite them to parties. Not everyone drinks at parties, so we can still have fun.",false
46,Therapist,Is there anyone in your life you could talk to for support in not drinking?,false
46,Client,Yeah. The friends who don't drink would probably be happy and supportive if I stopped drinking too.,false
46,Therapist,"That's great. You've identified reasons to stop drinking, like avoiding hangovers and trouble, and have thought of strategies such as spending time with non-drinking friends or choosing non-alcoholic drinks. It sounds like a solid plan. I'm proud of you for considering this change. How about we schedule an appointment two months from now to check in on your progress?",false
46,Client,Okay.,false
49,Therapist,"Welcome back, Catherine. I'm curious to hear what you've been reflecting on since our last session, especially regarding your thoughts about coming here today.",false
49,Client,Mm.,false
49,Therapist,What has changed in your perspective this time around?,false
49,Client,My expectations are a bit clearer now about why I'm here.,false
49,Therapist,That's great to hear.,false
49,Client,Thinking about my recent financial losses made me realize the importance of being here. [chuckles],false
49,Therapist,It sounds like there's been a positive shift since our last meeting.,false
49,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
49,Therapist,"I believe we can work well together. After our previous session, I felt you had the energy and motivation to make changes.",false
49,Client,Mm.,false
49,Therapist,"Today, let's discuss what areas would be beneficial for us to focus on over the next nine months.",false
49,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
49,Therapist,"We touched on your gambling issue last time, which seemed to have caused some family tensions. You mentioned feeling that you deserved it at the time. How open are you to exploring this from different perspectives?",false
49,Client,I'm willing to explore it further. [chuckles],false
49,Therapist,That's good to hear.,false
49,Client,Yeah.,false
49,Therapist,"Sometimes, when we delve into uncomfortable topics, it can feel a bit uneasy. How do you usually handle those feelings?",false
49,Client,I tend to withdraw a little. [chuckles],false
49,Therapist,What signs might indicate that I'm talking and you're withdrawing during our session?,false
49,Client,Probably fidgeting. You've probably already noticed. [chuckles],false
49,Therapist,"That's okay. It would be helpful if you could let me know when you start feeling uncomfortable, like saying, ""Ken, I'm starting to tune out because I feel uneasy.""",false
49,Client,Okay.,false
49,Therapist,Thank you for sharing that. Let's revisit the gambling issue since last time. You mentioned enjoying it but also owing money to a friend and facing financial strain with your parents no longer helping.,false
49,Client,[sighs] It's serious if I want to get out of debt.,false
49,Therapist,How important is resolving this on a scale from 1 to 100?,false
49,Client,About an 80. [chuckles],false
49,Therapist,"That's quite high. On the same scale, how confident are you in your ability to sort things out and move forward with life?",false
49,Client,I'm completely confident.,false
49,Therapist,And what would be your confidence level on a scale of 1 to 100 regarding sorting this out?,false
49,Client,What about my confidence to stop gambling? [chuckles],false
49,Therapist,"We're focusing on resolving the issue, not necessarily stopping immediately. How confident are you in finding a solution?",false
49,Client,It's challenging when it's part of your lifestyle.,false
49,Therapist,I understand. You mentioned going out with friends and gambling last night. Did you continue after they stopped?,false
49,Client,I had to stop because I ran out of money. [chuckles],false
49,Therapist,"So, even though you're trying to manage financially, the behavior still causes issues?",false
49,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
49,Therapist,What feelings arise when you think about this situation?,false
49,Client,I want to get back on track but not live in debt forever. [chuckles],false
49,Therapist,"It sounds like your current lifestyle is impacting your ability to travel and save, especially with the credit card debts.",false
49,Client,Yeah.,false
49,Therapist,Let's talk about your dreams. Where do you see yourself in five years? What are your aspirations?,false
49,Client,"Maybe I'd have traveled and found a partner. [chuckles] Kids could be an option too, but—",false
49,Therapist,That makes sense. It seems like you're considering what steps to take next.,false
49,Client,Yeah.,false
49,Therapist,Are you leaning more towards continuing with your current lifestyle or pursuing these dreams?,false
49,Client,Being a party girl at 30 doesn't sound appealing. [chuckles],false
49,Therapist,What's your intuition about this?,false
49,Client,"It's been fun, but I really want to travel.",false
49,Therapist,Where specifically do you dream of traveling?,false
49,Client,Egypt has always fascinated me.,false
49,Therapist,Why is Egypt so intriguing for you?,false
49,Client,"The culture, history, and outlook are fascinating. It's a place I've always wanted to visit.",false
49,Therapist,That sounds wonderful. How long have you had this aspiration?,false
49,Client,Since my early teens.,false
49,Therapist,So how does your current lifestyle affect your ability to pursue this dream?,false
49,Client,"With the money spent over the past five years, I could have visited Egypt multiple times by now. [chuckles]",false
49,Therapist,It seems like there are some important decisions to make about which path you want to follow.,false
49,Client,Mm.,false
49,Therapist,What do you think will be the most challenging part of pursuing your travel dreams?,false
49,Client,I might need to distance myself from some friendships since they're part of my current lifestyle.,false
49,Therapist,That sounds like a significant change. How far away do you feel from making this decision?,false
49,Client,"It seems like an unrealistic dream right now, but taking the first step could be manageable.",false
49,Therapist,What would that first step look like for you?,false
49,Client,"Probably cutting up my credit cards and resisting temptation, like avoiding pubs with gambling opportunities. [chuckles]",false
49,Therapist,That's a tough environment to navigate. We often refer to these as high-risk situations where it's easy to fall back into old habits.,false
49,Client,Mm. [chuckles],false
49,Therapist,How have you been managing this so far?,false
49,Client,"I haven't managed it well, but I need to become tougher with myself.",false
49,Therapist,"Being tough on yourself is important, and you've already identified some strategies like cutting up your credit cards.",false
49,Client,What about distancing from my friends?,false
49,Therapist,It's also worth considering who among your friends will support your dream of traveling. Cutting up your credit cards can be a powerful step towards change.,false
49,Client,Mm.,false
49,Therapist,You have some solid ideas already. We can continue to work on these strategies.,false
49,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
49,Therapist,"Since you mentioned that friendships could be challenging, do you think some of your friends might also be reconsidering their paths and dreams?",false
49,Client,Mm. Yeah.,false
49,Therapist,It seems clear where you want to go in five years. Let's focus on concrete steps to support this journey.,false
49,Client,Yeah.,false
49,Therapist,What is one thing you can do between now and our next meeting?,false
49,Client,Find the scissors. [laughs],false
49,Therapist,That sounds like a good start.,false
49,Client,"Then I need to figure out how to pay off my debts, but I'm not sure how yet.",false
49,Therapist,Creating a budget could be helpful for managing your finances.,false
49,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
49,Therapist,We can connect you with a budget advice service that might assist you. Let's arrange a meeting with them.,false
49,Client,That would be great.,false
43,Therapist,"Thank you, Tanya, for joining me today and sharing your thoughts. I'd like to explore with you something that's been on your mind—perhaps an aspect of yourself or a situation in your life where you feel ambivalent about making changes?",false
43,Client,"Well, I've been dealing with a lot of anxiety, especially regarding this important test I need to take. It's something I've been putting off because the anxiety makes me doubt my ability to succeed. This has been on my mind for years, and although I know I need to tackle it, my anxiety often stops me from doing so. I just want to stop feeling this way.",false
43,Therapist,"It sounds like your anxiety is a significant barrier, making you feel uncertain about succeeding in the exam.",false
43,Client,Yes.,false
43,Therapist,"So, avoiding the test seems easier for you at times?",false
43,Client,Exactly. I tend to avoid it and keep putting it off.,false
43,Therapist,"On a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 is not confident at all and 10 is very confident, how would you rate your confidence in managing your anxiety when taking this exam?",false
43,Client,Maybe around four or five.,false
43,Therapist,"So, you're feeling somewhere between four and five. That's better than a two or three, right?",false
43,Client,"Yes, because I've finally set up the appointment after years of delay. Although my anxiety is still high, I feel like I'm taking that first step by scheduling it. That's why I'd rate myself at four or five—it's progress, but it's still intimidating.",false
43,Therapist,It sounds encouraging to hear you've made this appointment and are moving forward despite previous delays.,false
43,Client,"Yes, and even after setting the date, I initially delayed again. But now that I've changed the date, I'm actually looking forward to it happening soon.",false
43,Therapist,"So previously, your anxiety led you to reschedule the exam multiple times?",false
43,Client,Yes.,false
43,Therapist,This time feels different for some reason. What makes you think you might not postpone it again this time?,false
43,Client,"It's been a long time coming, and I feel like I need to just do it. If I don't pass, I'll have to wait three more months before trying again. Then I can focus on studying during that time. Passing would lift so much weight off my shoulders—it's something I think about every day, and I'm tired of it.",false
43,Therapist,It sounds like the relief you'd feel after completing the exam is a strong motivator for you.,false
43,Client,"Yes, but then there's also the fear of negative thoughts that come with anxiety. If I don't pass, people will ask me how it went, and not passing would be embarrassing for me. That thought makes me really anxious.",false
43,Therapist,So avoiding those potential feelings is important to you?,false
43,Client,Right.,false
43,Therapist,Can you share a time in the past when you felt anxious about something but still managed to do it successfully?,false
43,Client,"About four or five years ago, I had to record something for work and was trying to find ways out of doing it. When I listened back to my recording, despite feeling anxious and not confident, it turned out really well. My supervisor and a consultant were surprised by how good it was, given how I usually carry myself. It was nice to receive compliments because I didn't trust in myself, but it felt good knowing I did a great job.",false
43,Therapist,"That experience seems to have boosted your self-confidence significantly, not just for yourself but also in the eyes of others. You must have been quite brave to overcome that initial anxiety and succeed.",false
43,Client,"Yes, I was.",false
43,Therapist,How do you think this past success could relate to what you're facing now with the test?,false
43,Client,"The same kind of anxiety is there with both situations. But if I pass this test, having a similar positive experience would be great. It's something I'd like to feel again.",false
43,Therapist,So creating opportunities for those positive feelings seems important to you.,false
43,Client,Right.,false
43,Therapist,You also mentioned feeling proud of yourself after that past success.,false
43,Client,Yes.,false
43,Therapist,"As we wrap up, considering your initial confidence level was a four or five, what would need to happen for it to rise to a seven?",false
43,Client,"With the test approaching soon, I think practicing and seeing how well I do could boost my confidence. Having faith in myself that I can succeed instead of doubting might help too.",false
43,Therapist,So positive self-talk could be quite beneficial for you?,false
43,Client,Yes.,false
43,Therapist,"To summarize, it seems like you're still anxious about the upcoming test, having rescheduled it multiple times before. However, this time feels different as you seem more determined to complete it. You've also reflected on past successes despite anxiety and felt proud of those achievements. It sounds like you're ready to finish this exam and remind yourself that success is possible.",false
43,Client,Yes.,false
43,Therapist,"Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me today, Tanya.",false
43,Client,Thank you.,false
43,Therapist,Mm-hmm.,false
64,Therapist,"Welcome, Ricky. It's nice to have you here.",false
64,Client,Thank you for having me.,false
64,Therapist,I'm glad to meet you as well.,false
64,Client,Likewise.,false
64,Therapist,Did you find it easy to locate us?,false
64,Client,"Yes, it was pretty straightforward.",false
64,Therapist,Great.,false
64,Client,Yeah. It's always good when things are simple.,false
64,Therapist,Have you been here before?,false
64,Client,"No, this is my first time.",false
64,Therapist,"I see. Well, I have some understanding of why you're here today—",false
64,Client,Yes.,false
64,Therapist,—but it would be helpful to hear from you directly about what brings you in.,false
64,Client,"Sure. A couple of weeks ago, a group of friends came over and suggested we just hang out and watch DVDs. But then they sat me down and said I might need help with my drug use. At first, I was annoyed, but after thinking it over, I decided it wouldn't hurt to talk to someone about it.",false
64,Therapist,I understand.,false
64,Client,Yes.,false
64,Therapist,So that's what led you here today?,false
64,Client,"Yes. After doing some research online, I found this place and thought I'd come in.",false
64,Therapist,It sounds like you felt there was something concerning that needed attention after your friends expressed their worries?,false
64,Client,"Yeah, I hadn't really considered it until they brought it up. Once they did, I could see where they were coming from, so I decided to look into it.",false
64,Therapist,They seemed concerned for your well-being?,false
64,Client,"Yes, which was a bit of a shock to me.",false
64,Therapist,You were surprised by their concern?,false
64,Client,"Definitely. In movies, people often intervene when someone needs help, but that's usually characters who are in serious trouble. I didn't see myself like that.",false
64,Therapist,So you're not sure if what they said applies to you?,false
64,Client,Right. Not to the extent they suggested. I didn't think I was at a point where intervention was necessary.,false
64,Therapist,"Okay, so it seems there's something concerning both you and your friends, but you're unsure of its severity and want to explore it further?",false
64,Client,"Exactly. They are my friends, and while I'm not going to dismiss their concerns outright, I also wondered if they were overreacting. But I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt.",false
64,Therapist,"So because your friends care about you and respect what they say, you're open to exploring whether there might be some truth in their concerns?",false
64,Client,"Yes, that's right.",false
64,Therapist,Let’s delve into this a bit more. Can you tell me specifically what your friends were concerned about?,false
64,Client,They mentioned drugs as the main issue. I occasionally use P and sometimes smoke or take party pills on weekends.,false
64,Therapist,How often would you say you do this?,false
64,Client,Maybe a couple of times a week.,false
64,Therapist,Is that with methamphetamine?,false
64,Client,"Yes, it is. When I put it in those terms, it does sound like a lot, but it doesn't feel excessive to me.",false
64,Therapist,We can explore whether it's excessive and discuss the effects and your concerns about it. Can you share what aspects of using meth have been positive for you?,false
64,Client,"Well, it ties into meeting new people when I moved to Auckland three years ago from Palmerston North. I discovered a different scene at places like Family Bar in Auckland, which was welcoming and accepting.",false
64,Therapist,So moving to Auckland allowed you to explore something new that wasn't available in Palmerston North?,false
64,Client,"Yes, it wasn’t planned, but once here, I found this vibrant community that felt very inclusive. It made me feel happy and accepted, unlike the environment back home.",false
64,Therapist,So being part of a gay culture in Auckland has been positive for you?,false
64,Client,Absolutely. And it's closely linked with the drug scene there.,false
64,Therapist,It sounds like these two aspects are intertwined rather than separate for you?,false
64,Client,"Yes, they often go hand-in-hand. Although now that I think about it, maybe they've become more connected over time.",false
64,Therapist,So coming to Auckland was a way of seeking something different in your life?,false
64,Client,"Yes, though not consciously at first. It just happened naturally once I got here.",false
64,Therapist,How does this part of your life feel now compared to when you first arrived?,false
64,Client,"Now it feels comfortable and routine after three years, but initially, it was exciting and new.",false
64,Therapist,So being part of the gay culture in Auckland is still a positive experience for you?,false
64,Client,"Yes, definitely. But it's closely linked with the drug scene.",false
64,Therapist,And these two aspects seem to be more connected than separate?,false
64,Client,"I think so, especially now that I reflect on it.",false
64,Therapist,So there might be some concerns about how closely your drug use is tied to this lifestyle?,false
64,Client,Maybe. It's something I hadn't considered until recently after my friends' intervention made me think differently.,false
64,Therapist,What changes have you noticed since then?,false
64,Client,"Just that I'm starting to see things from a different perspective, noticing aspects I hadn’t before.",false
64,Therapist,Can you share some of those new observations?,false
64,Client,"Well, when asked how often I use drugs, it surprised me. It sounds alarming when quantified, but it doesn't feel out of control to me.",false
64,Therapist,So there's a discrepancy between what feels normal for you and what others might perceive as concerning?,false
64,Client,Exactly. That’s why I felt defensive about my friends' concerns at first.,false
64,Therapist,You're worried about the drug use but not ready to label yourself negatively yet?,false
64,Client,"Yes, that's right.",false
64,Therapist,What are some of the positive aspects of using meth or smoking for you? Are there any downsides?,false
64,Client,"The downside is financial. I used to have a steady income from acting, which made it easier. Now, with less money coming in and more expenses, it’s becoming an issue.",false
64,Therapist,It seems like your circumstances have changed quite a bit over the past year?,false
64,Client,"Yes, definitely not as planned.",false
64,Therapist,Do you think there's any connection between your acting career and your drug use affecting your work opportunities?,false
64,Client,Possibly. I might have missed some auditions or not performed well because of it.,false
64,Therapist,Could the drugs be impacting your ability to get work?,false
64,Client,"Maybe. Sometimes, I question my spending choices when reflecting on what could have been done differently with that money.",false
64,Therapist,Are there other downsides related to drug use and financial decisions affecting your job or physical appearance?,false
64,Client,"Yes, it's also affected my relationships with friends and flatmates who've expressed concerns about continuing our friendship unless I address the issue.",false
64,Therapist,That sounds like a significant concern. Why is maintaining those friendships important to you?,false
64,Client,"They're crucial to me. Some of them are part of this scene too, but others have always been wary. It's hard when they don't understand my perspective on drug use.",false
64,Therapist,So some friends who also use drugs are concerned about your habits?,false
64,Client,"Yes, a few of them.",false
64,Therapist,You're starting to question your own usage and considering the implications?,false
64,Client,"Yes, I am.",false
64,Therapist,What concerns do you have if you don't make any changes in your drug use?,false
64,Client,"My acting career is a big concern. I want it to be my main focus, but I'm worried that my current habits are hindering my progress.",false
64,Therapist,So maintaining control over your drug use could help you pursue your acting goals more effectively?,false
64,Client,"Yes, and also manage my finances better since I can't afford as many courses or activities as before.",false
64,Therapist,It sounds like financial issues are a recurring concern. How do these affect other areas of your life?,false
64,Client,"They cause problems with my flatmates if rent isn’t paid on time, which is something I want to avoid.",false
64,Therapist,Let's revisit the connection between your meth use and socializing within the gay community. It seems like drug use is a constant presence in those settings?,false
64,Client,"Yes, it’s always there when we go out or party together.",false
64,Therapist,Is it challenging to be part of that scene without using drugs?,false
64,Client,I suppose so. That's all I've known since joining the scene here.,false
64,Therapist,Are there parts of this community where drug use isn't as prevalent?,false
64,Client,"There must be, but most people I know are involved in some way.",false
64,Therapist,We could explore other aspects of the gay scene that don’t focus on drugs if you're interested. It might offer alternative social options without major lifestyle changes.,false
64,Client,"Yes, that sounds like a good idea.",false
61,Therapist,"Hello Mrs. Smith, I'm Terri, one of the nurses working with Dr. Fields.",false
61,Client,"Oh yes, I remember you. We met before.",false
61,Therapist,"Yes, it seems we met during your last visit.",false
61,Client,That's right.,false
61,Therapist,And I recall that Dr. Fields discussed trying a tai chi class with you to see how it went. I wanted to check in and hear about your experience with tai chi.,false
61,Client,"Well, I attended one session.",false
61,Therapist,I see.,false
61,Client,"Yes, it was very beautiful, and the instructor was quite nice. However, I felt self-conscious because I'm still using my walker and had to sit in a chair instead of participating fully.",false
61,Therapist,I understand.,false
61,Client,"So, I just felt really self-conscious.",false
61,Therapist,It sounds like you appreciated the beauty and the instructor but felt self-conscious due to needing to use a chair?,false
61,Client,Very much so.,false
61,Therapist,You were quite self-conscious. Uh-huh.,false
61,Client,Yes.,false
61,Therapist,What did you hope to achieve by attending tai chi?,false
61,Client,"As Dr. Fields mentioned, it's supposed to help with balance, and I'm still experiencing some instability. I was hoping that I could eventually benefit from the class, mainly for my balance.",false
61,Therapist,"So, your goal was to improve your balance, but you haven't seen the results you were looking for yet?",false
61,Client,Not so far.,false
61,Therapist,Not yet.,false
61,Client,Yes.,false
61,Therapist,What is your overall goal? Where are you aiming to go with this?,false
61,Client,I want to return home.,false
61,Therapist,I see. Can you share what's important about going back home?,false
61,Client,"[sighs] Everything. I miss my little dog and being in my garden. I long for independence—sleeping when I choose, waking up on my own schedule, cooking for myself. The freedom of independence is something I really miss.",false
61,Therapist,"So, you're looking forward to going home to be with your dog, tend to your garden, and regain your independence?",false
61,Client,Yes.,false
61,Therapist,Mm-hmm.,false
61,Client,Yes.,false
61,Therapist,What do you think needs to happen for you to achieve the goal of returning home?,false
61,Client,"They've told me I need to walk down the hallway with my walker securely, without feeling unsteady.",false
61,Therapist,Uh-huh.,false
61,Client,And I haven't reached that point yet.,false
61,Therapist,Do you agree that achieving this is necessary for going home?,false
61,Client,"Yes. I don't want to risk falling. Some of my friends have had accidents, so while I'm hesitant, I do agree it's important.",false
61,Therapist,Uh-huh. How has your physical therapy been progressing?,false
61,Client,"It's improving. The pain isn't as intense, and I feel like I'm getting better.",false
61,Therapist,"So, you're noticing progress in physical therapy, which was one of the reasons for trying tai chi to help with balance?",false
61,Client,Yes.,false
61,Therapist,Would you consider returning to tai chi?,false
61,Client,"[sighs] Yes—I do. My friend loves it, and I wish I could join again. I'm not sure if I'm making sense, but yes, I would like to try again.",false
61,Therapist,It's important for you to decide whether tai chi is right for you.,false
61,Client,"After just one session, I can't be certain yet.",false
61,Therapist,Understandable.,false
61,Client,"Yes. It wouldn't be fair to judge after only once, but it didn't quite work out that time.",false
61,Therapist,"So, you haven't seen the results you hoped for yet—",false
61,Client,Right.,false
61,Client,"Yes, I would.",false
61,Therapist,What needs to happen for you to attend tai chi again?,false
61,Client,"I'd need to arrange everything once more, which is a bit complicated. Plus, I have to overcome my self-consciousness about using the walker and sitting out.",false
61,Therapist,Uh-huh.,false
61,Client,"Yes, and making those arrangements is tricky.",false
61,Therapist,"On a scale of 1 to 10, how confident are you that you can make these arrangements for tai chi?",false
61,Client,Five.,false
61,Therapist,Five. What makes it a five instead of one?,false
61,Client,"It's because I'm doing this alone. If someone could assist me, it would be easier.",false
61,Therapist,"So, having some help with the arrangements would increase your confidence?",false
61,Client,"Yes, that would help.",false
61,Therapist,Could your daughter assist you with these arrangements?,false
61,Client,"She could, but she can't visit often, so I'd have to wait at least a week.",false
61,Therapist,Would it be helpful if we assisted you in making those arrangements?,false
61,Client,"That would be great. As for feeling self-confident, that's something I need to work on myself.",false
61,Therapist,Understood. Are there any other obstacles preventing you from attending tai chi?,false
61,Client,Not that I can think of right now. The main issue is the arrangements.,false
61,Therapist,It sounds like you're making progress in physical therapy and are willing to give tai chi another try if we help with transportation to the class.,false
61,Client,"Yes, that's correct.",false
61,Therapist,"Before you leave today, I'll contact the rehab center to arrange transportation for you.",false
61,Client,You would do that?,false
61,Therapist,Absolutely. I'd be happy to assist.,false
61,Client,That would really help me out.,false
61,Therapist,"And when you come back for your follow-up with Dr. Fields, we can discuss how the second class went.",false
61,Client,Okay.,false
61,Therapist,All right.,false
61,Client,Thank you.,false
61,Therapist,"You're welcome, Mrs. Smith. I appreciate you coming in today and look forward to hearing about your progress.",false
61,Client,Okay.,false
73,Client,"He introduced me to it as well, so I gave it a try.",false
73,Therapist,It sounds like he encouraged you to experiment with some substances.,false
73,Client,Oxycontin.,false
73,Therapist,You tried oxycontin? Okay.,false
73,Client,Yes.,false
73,Therapist,So his encouragement led you to try that.,false
73,Client,"Well, yes, he mentioned it was a pain medication.",false
73,Therapist,He suggested it might help with the pain you've been experiencing.,false
73,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
73,Therapist,I see.,false
73,Client,"It does provide relief, but not as frequently—I only use it occasionally.",false
73,Therapist,So you trusted his advice and found that it helped in certain situations. Could you share more about how it alleviates your pain?,false
73,Client,It helps me cope with my grandmother's passing.,false
73,Therapist,I understand; it has been helpful for you in dealing with that loss.,false
73,Client,"Yes, I feel isolated, and missing her is hard, but it does help—",false
73,Therapist,Mm-hmm. So it provides some relief—,false
73,Client,-but I don't want to depend on taking it regularly.,false
73,Therapist,"Okay, so you prefer not to rely on it and don’t see yourself continuing its use. It's been helpful for now, though?",false
73,Client,"Mm-hmm. Yes, and—",false
73,Therapist,But you're hesitant about becoming dependent or reliant on it in the long term?,false
73,Client,Right.,false
73,Therapist,Understood. There seems to be a lot happening for you at this time. Is that correct?,false
73,Client,"Yes, there is.",false
73,Therapist,You've been doing your best to manage everything. It sounds like you also have some reservations about it?,false
73,Client,"Yeah, well, I don't know much beyond the fact that it makes me feel better.",false
73,Therapist,"Okay, so for now, you recognize that it improves how you feel.",false
67,Therapist,Would it be alright if we review the form you completed? We provide this to everyone who visits.,false
67,Client,"Yes, that's fine.",false
67,Therapist,"Great. It appears from your responses that you've had some alcohol use in the past year and used marijuana more frequently, about 30 days last year.",false
67,Client,That sounds right.,false
67,Therapist,"When we discuss substance use with students, I always start by saying it’s not my role to tell anyone what they should do. Instead, I’m interested in understanding if there's anything you might want to change regarding your usage. Could you share more about how often and why you use marijuana?",false
67,Client,"Sure, I vape using a pen but don't smoke.",false
67,Therapist,How frequently would you say you vape?,false
67,Client,A few times each month.,false
67,Therapist,Do you ever vape anything other than marijuana?,false
67,Client,"Once, someone shared peppermint oil with me.",false
67,Therapist,Would it be alright if I share some information about this topic?,false
67,Client,"Yes, go ahead.",false
67,Therapist,"Research shows that marijuana can affect the developing brain by making concentration and memory more challenging. Additionally, vaping can harm your lungs significantly. About one in six people who start using marijuana during their teenage years may develop an addiction later on. How do you feel about this information?",false
67,Client,I don't think it will hurt me.,false
67,Therapist,In what ways do you believe it impacts you personally?,false
67,Client,It helps me relax and enjoy time with my friends.,false
67,Therapist,Are there any aspects of marijuana use that concern you or things you dislike about it?,false
67,Client,I'm worried about getting into trouble at school.,false
67,Therapist,What kind of trouble might occur at school because of this?,false
67,Client,I could be suspended or removed from the basketball team.,false
67,Therapist,"So, maintaining your education and being part of the basketball team are important to you?",false
67,Client,"Yes, they are.",false
67,Therapist,"Considering these priorities, is there anything about your marijuana use that you might want to change?",false
67,Client,I was thinking about not using when basketball season starts.,false
67,Therapist,What benefits do you see in making this change?,false
67,Client,It helps me perform better on the court.,false
67,Therapist,"So, using marijuana affects your performance. Are there other advantages for you if you stop during basketball season?",false
67,Client,"If I don't get caught with a vape pen, I won’t risk being removed from the team.",false
67,Therapist,It sounds like you have set a goal to avoid marijuana use once basketball begins. How long do you think you can manage without using it?,false
67,Client,About a month.,false
67,Therapist,"On a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 means not very confident and 10 means very confident, how would you rate your confidence in achieving this goal?",false
67,Client,I'd say seven.,false
67,Therapist,Why did you choose seven instead of a lower number like five?,false
67,Client,Because I'm fairly certain I can stop for a month. I want to play well.,false
67,Therapist,What steps could you take to help ensure you don't use marijuana during this time?,false
67,Client,I’m not sure.,false
67,Therapist,Let’s consider what might tempt you to vape within the next month. What situations or feelings might lead you to want to vape?,false
67,Client,"When I'm stressed or unhappy, that's usually when I feel like vaping.",false
67,Therapist,"Besides vaping, what other activities could help you manage those feelings?",false
67,Client,Playing video games is something I enjoy.,false
67,Therapist,Is there anything else you can do?,false
67,Client,I can play basketball with my friend Sarah.,false
67,Therapist,So playing basketball and video games are ways for you to feel better.,false
67,Client,"Yes, they are.",false
67,Therapist,"It's encouraging to hear that you have a goal of quitting for a month and feel confident about it. If you're open to returning in a month or so, I'd be interested to learn how your plan is working out.",false
67,Client,"Sure, I can do that.",false
67,Therapist,"Best of luck with basketball practice. Remember, if there's anything you need or want to discuss before our next meeting, feel free to reach out any day from Monday through Thursday. It’s always good to see you.",false
70,Therapist,"Hello, Dr. Martin. I'm Lori, the pharmacist on duty today. It seems you have some questions about citalopram. Would it be alright to discuss this briefly?",false
70,Client,"Yes, I can spare a couple of minutes.",false
70,Therapist,Great. Are there any particular concerns or questions you'd like to address?,false
70,Client,Not anything specific—I'm just not familiar with the medication.,false
70,Therapist,"Understood. Citalopram is an SSRI used primarily for treating depression. It's usually prescribed in 20-milligram tablets, though it comes in 10, 20, and 40 milligrams. Patients starting on this should be monitored for symptom improvement within four to eight weeks.",false
70,Client,Got it. What about side effects?,false
70,Therapist,"Some possible side effects include gastrointestinal issues, sedation, or sexual dysfunction. If these occur, you might consider lowering the dose or switching medications. Are there any other questions on your mind?",false
70,Client,How does it interact with phenelzine?,false
70,Therapist,I'm not certain about that interaction. May I follow up with you later this afternoon to provide an answer?,false
70,Client,Sure.,false
70,Therapist,"Wonderful, thank you for understanding.",false
70,Client,Thank you.,false
76,Therapist,"Hi, Deborah. How are you feeling today?",false
76,Client,I'm doing really well.,false
76,Therapist,That's great to hear! You completed your Values Clarification Sheet. Is there anything specific from it that you'd like to discuss or any insights you found interesting?,false
76,Client,"Yes, I really enjoy this process. I rated health as my top value because physical and mental health, along with spiritual and emotional well-being, are all important to me. I'm currently working towards a certification to become a fitness trainer through an extension program at Cal State [inaudible 00:00:40]. It's been five weeks, and I have a final exam this Saturday. I'm feeling a bit nervous about it, but also excited. After that, I'll be waiting for my results. Additionally, I've started an internship, which is exciting as it marks a new career path for me. Being an office worker has become monotonous, so pursuing physical activity and health feels refreshing.",false
76,Therapist,"It sounds like prioritizing your health is guiding you towards this new direction, especially after being in an office job for so long. You're now engaging in work that aligns with what you truly want to do.",false
76,Client,"Exactly. I love staying active. Ideally, I'd love to coach tennis if I were more skilled at it, but my current level isn't sufficient for coaching others.",false
76,Therapist,Have you completed this Values Clarification Sheet multiple times?,false
76,Client,"Yes, I have.",false
76,Therapist,Has health consistently been your top value throughout these exercises?,false
76,Client,"It's always been near the top, definitely within the top three. I can't recall if it was always number one, but it has certainly been important to me due to challenges with inner harmony at different points in my life. This time, I placed it second.",false
76,Therapist,"So, you've ranked inner harmony as your second value?",false
76,Client,"Yes, it's interesting that it wasn't initially among the top 12 values. But upon reflection, it relates to peace or inner peace, which is why I prioritized it higher this time.",false
76,Therapist,Would you like to share more about how inner harmony influences your life?,false
76,Client,"Since practicing and teaching yoga, I've found a greater sense of inner harmony. It's helped me feel more at peace with myself during quiet moments and meditation. Overall, I feel really good about who I am now.",false
76,Therapist,"So, would you say that the focus on yoga is connected to your emphasis on inner harmony?",false
76,Client,"Yes, it definitely plays a part. Also, realizing that prioritizing my own needs isn't selfish has been liberating. I've always tried to please others and put myself last, believing that was how a good person should behave. However, there are times when helping others is important, as long as it doesn't harm me in the process. It's fulfilling to help without feeling obligated.",false
76,Therapist,"So reflecting on your past feelings of putting yourself last, you've come to understand that inner peace and harmony involve self-worth and self-love, which isn't selfish at all.",false
76,Client,Exactly. I can be there for others as long as it doesn't harm me. It's important to maintain that balance.,false
76,Therapist,"And service is your third value because you genuinely enjoy helping others, even if it means some inconvenience on your part?",false
76,Client,"Yes, like when my brother’s daughter and granddaughter visit, I sometimes sleep on an air mattress while they stay in the spare room. Even if it's a bit inconvenient or messy, it's not a big deal to me.",false
76,Therapist,And wisdom was initially high on your list because you value learning and experiencing different cultures?,false
76,Client,"Yes, immersing myself in various cultures has been enlightening. I've spent time with Native American communities, which has enriched my understanding of the world. Pleasure is also important to me; it's intertwined with joy and satisfaction from life experiences.",false
76,Therapist,So pleasure being your fifth value means you acknowledge that pain and disappointment are part of life too?,false
76,Client,"Absolutely. True joy comes from accepting that not everything will be perfect, and I'll experience setbacks or injuries at times.",false
76,Therapist,"It sounds like your list tells a story about your values—health as number one, service second, inner harmony third, wisdom fourth, and pleasure fifth. You've embraced the idea of helping others without compromising your own well-being, and you're open to life's ups and downs while finding joy in them.",false
76,Client,"Yes, that sums it up nicely.",false
76,Therapist,It was wonderful talking with you today.,false
76,Client,I enjoyed our conversation too. Your encouragement means a lot.,false
76,Therapist,I'm glad to hear that. Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me.,false
88,Therapist,"In our South Whisky program, we encourage participants to select at least three goals they wish to focus on over the next 30 days. We'll check in with you after this period to see your progress. It's important that these goals are meaningful and achievable for you. Are there any changes you'd like to work on, either at home or school?",false
88,Client,I need to start arriving on time for my first class because I always miss it.,false
88,Therapist,"So, being punctual for your first class is a goal you want to focus on over the next 30 days?",false
88,Client,Yes.,false
88,Therapist,That's an excellent goal. Can you share why this particular goal is important to you?,false
88,Client,It would stop people from nagging me about it.,false
88,Therapist,Who are these individuals who express concern?,false
88,Client,"My mom constantly reminds me to get to school on time, and my PO warns that being late could result in sanctions, which I want to avoid.",false
88,Therapist,Avoiding those consequences is definitely important for you.,false
88,Client,Yes.,false
88,Therapist,So getting to your first class on time will be one of your goals.,false
88,Client,I'll give it a try.,false
88,Therapist,What specific actions do you think would help ensure you arrive at school on time?,false
88,Client,"Waking up in the morning is tough for me, and by the time I'm ready, I've missed the bus. Then I have to walk or find another way there, which makes me late for various reasons.",false
88,Therapist,So it seems like multiple factors contribute to your lateness?,false
88,Client,Yes.,false
88,Therapist,"Given these challenges, what do you think would be most effective in helping you arrive on time? What steps do you feel are necessary?",false
88,Client,Getting up earlier might help me get there on time.,false
88,Therapist,At what time should you wake up then?,false
88,Client,"[sighs] To catch the bus, I'd need to be up by 6:15. It's hard because I stay up late and I'm not sure if I can manage it.",false
88,Therapist,"So while there are challenges, you're motivated to try this because avoiding sanctions is important to you?",false
88,Client,Right. I could give it a shot-,false
88,Therapist,That sounds like a good plan.,false
88,Client,-and see how it goes.,false
88,Therapist,You're willing to at least attempt it?,false
88,Client,Yes.,false
88,Therapist,What time would you need to go to bed to ensure you wake up by 6:15?,false
88,Client,"I usually sleep around midnight, so maybe if I try going to bed at 11:00.",false
88,Therapist,So you're considering going to bed at 11:00 and setting your alarm for 6:15 the next morning?,false
88,Client,Yes.,false
88,Therapist,When would be a good day for you to start this new routine?,false
88,Client,Either tomorrow or the following day.,false
88,Therapist,"If I were to note it down, which date would you prefer—tomorrow or the next day?",false
88,Client,Let's start tomorrow.,false
88,Therapist,Tomorrow sounds great. Who could assist you in getting to bed on time and waking up by 6:15?,false
88,Client,My mom.,false
88,Therapist,Your mom can be a helpful support. What might she do to help with this plan?,false
88,Client,"[sighs] After my alarm goes off, if I don't get up, she could come in and remind me that I committed to getting up on time.",false
88,Therapist,"So you'd like your mom's reminder to reinforce that this is something important for you personally, not just because she wants it?",false
88,Client,Exactly. Yup.,false
88,Therapist,That sounds perfect. What might prevent you from waking up by 6:15?,false
88,Client,[sighs] Not going to bed on time will be a challenge.,false
88,Therapist,"Staying up late could interfere with your plan. If you feel tempted to stay up later, how might you respond differently?",false
88,Client,"I should just go to bed and turn off the lights, leave my phone out of reach.",false
88,Therapist,So keeping your phone away is important for minimizing distractions. Turning off the lights can also signal that it's time to sleep?,false
88,Client,Yes.,false
88,Therapist,It sounds like a good reminder to help you wind down. Anything else that might support this plan?,false
88,Client,Have my mom check on me to make sure everything's put away.,false
88,Therapist,And having your mom's support will be beneficial as well.,false
88,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
88,Therapist,Great. How will you know if your plan is working effectively?,false
88,Client,"When I'm in class on time, right when the bell rings.",false
88,Therapist,So being present for your first-hour class when the bell rings indicates that you're meeting your goal.,false
88,Client,Absolutely.,false
88,Therapist,"To summarize, arriving at your first hour is crucial to avoid sanctions and unwanted attention. You've identified a plan involving going to bed by 11:00, turning off lights, putting away your phone, and having your mom's support to wake up at 6:15. It seems like you're ready to start this tomorrow.",false
88,Client,"Well, yeah, I hope so.",false
88,Therapist,"That sounds like a solid plan, and you've committed to starting it tomorrow.",false
88,Client,I'll give it a try.,false
88,Therapist,Thank you for sharing your plan with me.,false
88,Client,You're welcome.,false
79,Client,"Something clicked when I realized how much I'd had to drink, and it dawned on me that I really messed up.",false
79,Therapist,What made you realize that you had made a mistake?,false
79,Client,"It was because I found myself in the same situation where I used to come home and take pills—it felt eerily familiar. And strangely enough, I wanted to stay right there. I just felt like I'd destroyed everything. Erin's been using the phone now, and he called me the next day; it was great, but I felt so ashamed of myself. I don't want to feel that way again.",false
79,Therapist,It sounds like you were worried about putting something very important at risk. Is that what made you feel guilty when talking to Erin on the phone?,false
79,Client,"Yes, because of what happened—I mean, I could have continued drinking heavily and done it every night for the rest of the week.",false
79,Therapist,So you recognized that you were risking something significant to you.,false
79,Client,"But I'm not sure if I stopped because I knew I had to or because I just wanted to stay right there. Anyway, uh—[crosstalk].",false
79,Therapist,"Here you are, three months in, and things have been going really well for such a long time. You've even started to see your kids again, which was something you were working towards.",false
79,Client,"Yes, they're better now.",false
79,Therapist,"That's great progress. And then it felt like a shift from red to cautionary—you could see your kids, and that was a big part of what you were striving for.",false
79,Client,"Yeah, exactly.",false
82,Therapist,Would you be open to answering some questions and doing a self-assessment regarding your feelings about alcohol use and contraception?,false
82,Client,Sure.,false
82,Therapist,"Great. We'll use a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 means not important or confident at all, and 10 means very important or confident. On this scale, how important is it for you to drink within safe limits?",false
82,Client,I would say an eight.,false
82,Therapist,"An eight, understood. And on the same scale, how confident do you feel right now about your ability to stay below those risk levels when drinking?",false
82,Client,A four.,false
82,Therapist,"Four, got it. You see it as quite important, but your confidence is a bit lower at four. What gives you some confidence that you can manage to drink within safe limits and remember what they are?",false
82,Client,"I think it's because you've informed me about the risks, and with alcoholism in my family history, I really don't want to follow that path. So, I feel confident that I can change this at this point.",false
82,Therapist,That sounds like a strong motivation for not drinking excessively. Is there anything else?,false
82,Client,"Well, I have friends who don’t drink, and when I'm with them, it's not an issue. Their presence helps me too.",false
82,Therapist,So having supportive friends allows you to enjoy yourself while staying within safe drinking limits?,false
82,Client,Yep.,false
82,Therapist,Anything else that supports this?,false
82,Client,Nope.,false
82,Therapist,"Now let’s discuss your contraception use. On a scale from 1 to 10, how important is it for you to consistently use effective birth control to prevent pregnancy?",false
82,Client,An eight.,false
82,Therapist,"Eight, understood. And on the same scale, how confident are you right now that you can use effective birth control every time?",false
82,Client,Probably a six.,false
82,Therapist,"A six. Why do you feel it's a six rather than lower, like two or three?",false
82,Client,"I'm a six because if I drink less, I'll be more reliable with using birth control. When I've had too much to drink, I tend to neglect it and don't care as much.",false
82,Therapist,"So your drinking habits are linked to how well you manage contraception. If you address the drinking issue, you might also improve in this area?",false
82,Client,Yeah.,false
82,Therapist,That makes sense. It seems like you're using a good method but not consistently due to alcohol use. Would you be interested in developing a plan around your alcohol consumption today before you leave?,false
82,Client,Before I leave?,false
82,Therapist,"Yes, that's right.",false
82,Client,Okay.,false
82,Therapist,We can also provide more information if needed.,false
82,Client,Okay.,false
82,Therapist,Great.,false
100,Therapist,What brings you here today?,false
100,Client,"I'm uncertain. It's just that dealing with my criminal past and trying to stay on a positive path is overwhelming. I want to be a productive member of society, but my background seems like an insurmountable barrier. Sometimes it feels like reverting to what I know might be easier since working low-wage jobs for so long is frustrating. This situation has led to anger and depression resurfacing, and I'm determined not to fall back into old habits.",false
100,Therapist,It sounds like this is significantly hindering your progress toward becoming who you want to be.,false
100,Client,"Yes, it really is.",false
100,Therapist,Can you tell me more about how your criminal record specifically obstructs your goals?,false
100,Client,I'm not entirely sure what aspect of it—,false
100,Therapist,Does your record include a conviction?,false
100,Client,"Yes, there's a felony on my record.",false
100,Therapist,Okay. It seems like that's the major issue.,false
100,Client,"Absolutely. At the time, I thought avoiding jail was enough. But now it feels more like a lifelong sentence than just the four years they initially offered. Even after going back to school and earning a degree, aiming for professional work has become unexpectedly difficult.",false
100,Therapist,"So when you apply for jobs, your felony conviction seems to disqualify you before even being considered?",false
100,Client,"Exactly. In cases where I'm unaware of it affecting my application, not getting callbacks is frustrating too. The interviews that really matter are the ones that end in rejection, especially after doing well and feeling like a job offer was imminent.",false
100,Therapist,Do you disclose your felony conviction before going for an interview?,false
100,Client,"No, it varies. Sometimes they ask during the interview, or I mention it if there's no application process involved, like when someone refers me directly. In those cases, it feels like the decision is already made once the interview goes well.",false
100,Therapist,So it seems like you're almost guaranteed a job in these situations?,false
100,Client,"Yes, it feels that way. The real challenge comes at the end of the interview when I disclose my past and they back out, despite everything going smoothly up to that point.",false
100,Therapist,It must be tough to go through such promising interviews only to face rejection due to your record.,false
100,Client,"Recently, I had an interview where it seemed like a job offer was about to happen. My brother referred me, and the interview went great until they asked for a background check. I disclosed my past at that point, but it still led to disappointment.",false
100,Therapist,Your brother didn't know there would be a background check when he gave you the referral?,false
100,Client,"No, he did mention it, but wasn't sure if they'd conduct one. He encouraged me to try anyway.",false
100,Therapist,It sounds like being upfront about your past might help avoid further disappointment.,false
100,Client,I think so. Maybe finding a tactful way to bring it up earlier could spare me some frustration and heartache.,false
100,Therapist,"You could say something like, ""I'm a recovering person with a felony conviction from my past life. Before we proceed, I don't want to waste your time if this is an issue.""",false
100,Client,That seems straightforward but necessary. It might be better than hoping for the best after investing so much effort.,false
100,Therapist,"If you'd like, we can work on phrasing that feels comfortable and authentic for you. Practicing interviews has been beneficial, even though they often end in rejection.",false
100,Client,"Yes, I've gotten a lot of practice with interviewing itself, which is helpful.",false
100,Therapist,"Another resource might be the John Howard Society, an advocacy group working to change laws related to this issue. They have valuable information on reducing recidivism and addressing prejudice.",false
100,Client,I've heard of them but haven't explored their resources yet. It's frustrating how these barriers contribute to high recidivism rates due to limited opportunities and societal prejudices.,false
100,Therapist,"Absolutely, it's a significant issue. You're also unable to vote, which is another restriction that many people find surprising.",false
100,Client,"Yes, ignorance plays a big role in this. There are so many injustices tied to these barriers.",false
100,Therapist,I'll look into more information from the John Howard Society and other resources like the ACLU for you.,false
100,Client,"That would be great. Right now, my main focus is on improving my mental health since dealing with rejection has been tough. But once I'm feeling better, I'd love to explore these options further.",false
100,Therapist,We can definitely revisit this when you're ready. Thank you for being open about your experiences; it helps in finding the right support for you.,false
100,Client,No problem. Thanks for understanding and offering suggestions.,false
94,Therapist,"Great, so today we're here to discuss whatever you'd like to explore.",false
94,Client,How about we talk about my struggle with motivating someone to move out of my house?,false
94,Therapist,"I see, it sounds like you're trying to encourage them to leave. Could you tell me more about the situation so I can understand better?",false
94,Client,"Sure, I offered my home for a transitional period when they needed help.",false
94,Therapist,That's very generous of you to offer your home during their time of need. It seems like now you feel it's time for them to move on and reclaim your space. Is that right?,false
94,Client,"Yes, exactly. I want change, but I struggle with being assertive enough to say the words. You're correct; I'd like to be able to do that.",false
94,Therapist,What might help you reach a point where you feel confident in asking them to leave?,false
94,Client,"[sighs] I'm not sure. Part of me cares about this person, and there's comfort in having someone around. So, I'm conflicted because while part of me wants the companionship, another part knows it's time for change. I'm unsure what I want to do.",false
94,Therapist,It sounds like you're torn between wanting them to leave and feeling secure with their presence.,false
94,Client,"Yes, it's kind of like that old song ""Hit The Road Jack."" [laughs]",false
94,Therapist,But it seems you're not quite ready to sing that song just yet.,false
94,Client,"[laughs] Well, if I started singing, he might leave quickly because I can carry a tune! [laughs]",false
94,Therapist,You did a great job with the song; your humor is appreciated and helps lighten the mood.,false
94,Client,"Humor is essential in life for me. Otherwise, it would be like constantly seeking out news to distract myself. [laughs]",false
94,Therapist,It sounds like laughter helps you cope with difficult situations.,false
94,Client,"Absolutely. Even comedians use humor as a way to deal with their struggles. Maybe I should consider that path! [laughs] Like this friend Ruth, who has a serious job but does comedy on the side. [laughs]",false
94,Therapist,What benefits would you experience if they moved out now?,false
94,Client,"Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. It's challenging to pinpoint exactly what it is.",false
94,Therapist,Could you elaborate on that a bit more?,false
94,Client,"Well, I need some time to think because—",false
94,Therapist,Is there any guilt involved in this decision?,false
94,Client,"Yes, probably some guilt. I go back and forth with my feelings about it.",false
94,Therapist,It seems like part of you wants to do the right thing because helping others is important to you.,false
94,Client,"Yes, that's true. Thank you for acknowledging that; I appreciate it.",false
94,Therapist,But perhaps your duty there has been fulfilled.,false
94,Client,"Right, it's just difficult to accept that my role is done and realize I need to be more assertive and confident in myself.",false
94,Therapist,What steps have you taken so far to encourage them to leave?,false
94,Client,"We've had several conversations, some of which weren't very pleasant. I tend to hold things in until they build up, then I become quite logical about it. But recently, my approach has been less rational. [laughs]",false
94,Therapist,You mentioned earlier that you've discussed other living options with them.,false
94,Client,"Yes, he's proactive about finding places, and I've shared those options with him. It eases the conversation because there are safety nets available for him.",false
94,Therapist,"So, it might involve helping them pack their belongings to move to these new places?",false
94,Client,"Been there, done that! [laughs]",false
94,Therapist,You have experience with this process. When do you plan to take action?,false
94,Client,I've told him he needs to leave within a couple of days because I have plans and uncertainties about my own living situation. I've been here for seven years but things are changing daily.,false
94,Therapist,It sounds like an uncertain time for you as well.,false
94,Client,"Yes, it's quite daunting. And having this extra responsibility is overwhelming. [chuckles]",false
94,Therapist,So he represents that additional burden?,false
94,Client,"Exactly. I care about him, but we're all adults here; it's time to move forward.",false
94,Therapist,It seems you've decided they'll leave within a couple of days.,false
94,Client,"That's the plan, at least. I'm not sure what their plans are, but that's my intention.",false
94,Therapist,I have a feeling your plans will come through. [laughter],false
94,Client,I appreciate your optimism; I'll let him know! [laughs].,false
94,Therapist,Thank you for sharing and engaging in this discussion with me.,false
94,Client,Thank you.,false
91,Therapist,"Hello, Jean. I'm Dr. Selby. It's a pleasure to meet you.",false
91,Client,"Good morning, doctor.",false
91,Therapist,How can I assist you today?,false
91,Client,"Well, doctor, after being diagnosed with COPD over three months ago, I finally made an appointment because I need help quitting smoking.",false
91,Therapist,I see.,false
91,Client,"Although it took me a while to reach out, I realize this is my first step towards change. It's time for action.",false
91,Therapist,"Taking the initiative is important. So, you've been diagnosed by—",false
91,Client,A respirologist.,false
91,Therapist,A respirologist made that diagnosis. How are you feeling at this moment?,false
91,Client,I'm really scared because my health hasn't been good for some time now. Even talking on the phone with customers triggers coughing fits.,false
91,Therapist,"It sounds like your long history of smoking, coupled with this recent diagnosis, has left you feeling quite frightened and anxious.",false
91,Client,"Yes, I don’t know what to do about it.",false
91,Therapist,Understandable. Have you considered a timeline for when you'd like to quit?,false
91,Client,"I'm giving myself six months, but that feels far off, and honestly, I doubt my ability to succeed at this point—I hardly have any faith in myself right now.",false
91,Therapist,"So, while your goal is to quit smoking within the next six months, you're feeling uncertain about your capacity to achieve it and are concerned about failing.",false
91,Client,"I don't know what to do. I've tried quitting before—pills, patches, therapy—but nothing has worked. The longest I managed was during a week-long hospital stay.",false
91,Therapist,"So, the only time you were able to quit smoking was when you were in the hospital?",false
91,Client,"Yes, I had no choice then. But as soon as I left, I went back to my usual habit.",false
91,Therapist,Let's explore this further. Can you share what benefits smoking brings to your life?,false
91,Client,"It's been a part of me since I was 13 or 14. My parents and their friends smoked; it seemed glamorous on TV. Smoking has become an extension of myself, helping with my nerves.",false
91,Therapist,"So, from what you've shared, smoking helps you relax, provides something to do, and is tied to your image—making you feel sophisticated and stylish. Is that correct?",false
91,Client,"Yes, exactly.",false
91,Therapist,Anything else I might have missed?,false
91,Client,"Well, it's enjoyable for me. It relaxes me after meals, and my family and coworkers often join in on smoke breaks—it’s a way we bond.",false
91,Therapist,"So quitting is challenging because those around you are smokers, making it easy to take breaks with them.",false
91,Client,"I hadn't thought of it that way, but you're probably right.",false
91,Therapist,"Now, let's discuss the downsides of smoking for you.",false
91,Client,It’s detrimental to my health and frightening since I don’t feel well. My coughing fits are frequent even during work calls.,false
91,Therapist,Are there any other negative aspects?,false
91,Client,"Yes, it's costly—I smoke 30 to 50 cigarettes a day—and it's affecting my appearance. I'm aging prematurely with lines and clogged skin, leading me to spend more on cosmetics.",false
91,Therapist,"So the downsides include health impacts, changes in your physical appearance, and financial costs related to both smoking and makeup. Is that right?",false
91,Client,Yes.,false
91,Therapist,"Considering everything you've shared, on a scale from 1 to 10, where 10 is extremely important, how crucial is it for you to quit smoking?",false
91,Client,"For my health and finances, quitting is definitely a 10.",false
91,Therapist,"It's clearly very important. On the same scale, with 10 being utmost confidence, how confident do you feel about your ability to quit?",false
91,Client,I'd say around 35 or 40%.,false
91,Therapist,"So, why did you choose 40% instead of something lower like 10 or zero? You mentioned doubts about quitting.",false
91,Client,"Well, I'm still determined. Realizing this has made me feel good for coming here today. It was a significant step encouraged by people who care about me.",false
91,Therapist,"That makes sense. So, what would it take to increase your confidence from 40% to around 45%?",false
91,Client,"Perhaps more sessions with you or some new strategies, maybe joining a group. I need support.",false
91,Therapist,So receiving help could boost your confidence from 40% to 45%.,false
91,Client,"Yes, because just coming here today has already made me feel better.",false
91,Therapist,"That's great. Jean, congratulations on taking this vital first step towards addressing an issue you've faced for a long time. Would you be open to monitoring your smoking over the next week? Writing it down can make each cigarette a conscious decision and help regain control, which is often the initial small step.",false
91,Client,"So, I should think more about it rather than acting automatically?",false
91,Therapist,Exactly. Keeping track of it in writing aids this process.,false
91,Client,"Yes, because when I feel the urge, I could resist and wait for the next one, noting that I didn't act immediately.",false
91,Therapist,That sounds like a good plan. I can provide you with a card to help keep track. You can bring it back at our next meeting for us to discuss further. Is there anything else on your mind?,false
91,Client,"No, this gives me something concrete to work towards until we meet again.",false
91,Therapist,Excellent. Thank you so much for coming in today.,false
91,Client,"Thank you for seeing me, doctor.",false
91,Therapist,You're welcome.,false
97,Therapist,"So, Mr. Smith, we've got your medication sorted out now.",false
97,Client,That's good to hear.,false
97,Therapist,I noticed that your blood pressure is a bit elevated.,false
97,Client,"Yes, it seems so.",false
97,Therapist,May I take a moment to discuss your weight with you?,false
97,Client,What do you mean by that?,false
97,Therapist,Could we spend just a couple of minutes talking about your weight?,false
97,Client,Are you serious? I've made time in my busy day for this appointment.,false
97,Therapist,"Yes, I understand.",false
97,Client,And then there's the 45-minute wait in your waiting room—,false
97,Therapist,"Yes, I realize that was inconvenient.",false
97,Client,It really isn't acceptable.,false
97,Therapist,I hear you.,false
97,Client,"You know, if I schedule a meeting with a client for 10:00—",false
97,Therapist,"Yes, I understand.",false
97,Client,"—I expect it to start on time, not an hour later.",false
97,Therapist,"Right, and given your busy schedule—",false
97,Client,Exactly. I have other commitments like managing accounts and seeing clients.,false
97,Therapist,I see.,false
97,Client,You know?,false
97,Therapist,"It wasn't easy for you to make the time to come here, and then there was a wait in the waiting room before we even started discussing weight.",false
97,Client,"Yes, okay, fair enough. My blood pressure medication needs changing, but honestly, I don’t have time to talk about my weight right now. I'm aware of it.",false
97,Therapist,Understood.,false
97,Client,I know the issues and potential solutions.,false
97,Therapist,Right.,false
97,Client,"So, a discussion isn't necessary at this moment; I just have too much on my plate.",false
97,Therapist,It sounds like you're feeling rushed today.,false
97,Client,"Yes, that's true.",false
97,Therapist,I apologize for the wait in the waiting room.,false
97,Client,"Well, it’s not professional, is it?",false
97,Therapist,I understand. And asking you to spend a few minutes now isn't easy when you're eager to leave.,false
97,Client,But I have other tasks to attend to.,false
97,Therapist,"Yes, I get that.",false
97,Client,I need to return to my office.,false
97,Therapist,Of course.,false
97,Client,There's a lot of work waiting for me—,false
97,Therapist,I understand.,false
97,Client,—and every minute away from my day means working late or on weekends.,false
97,Therapist,That makes sense. It’s important to you.,false
97,Client,"When you're self-employed, there aren't many options.",false
97,Therapist,"Exactly. You have control over your schedule, just a few minutes now.",false
97,Client,"Well, since I'm here, I suppose if it's only for a couple of minutes, that's fine.",false
97,Therapist,I promise to keep it brief.,false
97,Client,"Okay, because I really need to get back to work.",false
97,Therapist,May I ask how you feel about addressing your weight?,false
97,Client,"About losing weight? Obviously, I want to.",false
97,Therapist,"Yes, of course.",false
97,Client,"Everyone does. I know I'm above my ideal weight and it's causing issues. For example, I get winded easily with physical activity, and I realize that my blood pressure—",false
97,Therapist,Right.,false
97,Client,—might be contributing to the problem.,false
97,Therapist,"So you see how your weight affects your health, and you'd like things to improve.",false
97,Client,"Yes, there are other priorities too, but losing weight is definitely something I want to tackle. You get on [inaudible 00:03:17]",false
97,Therapist,You would like to if it were possible?,false
97,Client,"Yes, I understand the theory—regular exercise and a balanced diet. But with my self-employed lifestyle as an accountant, finding time for exercise or planning meals is challenging.",false
97,Therapist,I see.,false
97,Client,It often means relying on ready meals—,false
97,Therapist,"Like quick, convenient options.",false
97,Client,"Exactly, food on the go, grazing throughout the day.",false
97,Therapist,Let me summarize what you've shared. You lead a busy life running your business with many responsibilities.,false
97,Client,"Yes, that's right.",false
97,Therapist,"You're aware of how your weight impacts your health and are concerned about it. Ideally, you'd like to make changes, but your schedule is hectic, and convenience foods help manage your workload.",false
97,Client,"Yes, my lifestyle makes food just fuel for me. I'm juggling many tasks and can't afford to drop any.",false
97,Therapist,"I understand that. If it were possible to fit in time, you'd like things to be different, but it's challenging right now.",false
97,Client,Exactly.,false
97,Therapist,How about we schedule another appointment in a couple of weeks to continue this conversation?,false
97,Client,"Sure, but finding the time will still be an issue—",false
97,Therapist,I understand.,false
97,Client,"—and if I make an appointment, I don't want to wait again for so long—",false
97,Therapist,"Absolutely. What if you come first thing at 8:30? That way, there's no waiting.",false
97,Client,That would work well.,false
97,Therapist,The goal of that visit will be to explore how you can incorporate a healthier lifestyle into your busy routine.,false
97,Client,I'll check my schedule and see what adjustments can be made so it’s not wasted time. I’ll come prepared with some thoughts on this.,false
97,Therapist,That sounds great.,false
97,Client,"Of course, I'll do that.",false
97,Therapist,Excellent. Let's make sure to arrange it and reflect on our discussion today.,false
97,Client,"Okay, thank you. Sorry for going off track a bit.",false
109,Therapist,"I'm glad to hear there are no cavities. However, I do have some concerns about irritation in your mouth known as nicotinic stomatitis.",false
109,Client,"Oh, that doesn't sound good.",false
109,Therapist,"It's a condition caused by tobacco use, affecting the roof of your mouth. Could you share how tobacco fits into your life currently?",false
109,Client,"Tobacco? Well, I've never smoked cigarettes. But when I'm out with friends at bars, we might have drinks and smoke some small cigarillos. They're not like cigars or cigarettes to me. Just one or two in the evening, definitely not 20 or 30 a day.",false
109,Therapist,"So you've chosen not to smoke cigarettes due to health concerns, but you do enjoy smoking those little cigarillos occasionally with friends.",false
109,Client,It's just something we do socially. Not a habit or necessity for me—just one or two when we go out.,false
109,Therapist,I understand it’s more of a social activity than heavy smoking like chain smokers.,false
109,Client,"Oh, no. Definitely not.",false
109,Therapist,"Even though the amount seems small to you, it's still causing damage to your mouth.",false
109,Client,"You have a point there. Recently, I've started having one or two at work during breaks with friends who smoke. It’s only been happening lately.",false
109,Therapist,"So smoking has become more integrated into your social life, both when going out and even during work breaks.",false
109,Client,"Yes, now that you mention it, I am smoking daily.",false
109,Therapist,"Aside from the social aspect, what do you enjoy about smoking?",false
109,Client,"It's relaxing and enjoyable to be with people. When we go to places like Las Vegas, visiting cigar bars feels sophisticated and fun. Mostly, it’s a social thing for me.",false
109,Therapist,I see.,false
109,Client,I wouldn't consider myself a chain smoker.,false
109,Therapist,What about any negative aspects you've noticed from smoking?,false
109,Client,"Well, my teeth have more stains than before, which I assume is due to smoking.",false
109,Therapist,We're seeing some concerning effects on your oral health. Are there other concerns related to smoking?,false
109,Client,"Yes, the cost is a concern too, especially with how tight finances are these days. Buying more of them adds up.",false
109,Therapist,"So you’re aware of the impact on both your oral health and finances, along with earlier concerns about cigarette smoking's harm.",false
109,Client,"Oh, yes.",false
109,Therapist,Were you aware that those little cigarillos could have similar negative health effects?,false
109,Client,"Absolutely not. I thought it was just a fun activity with friends, not something harmful.",false
109,Therapist,It seems surprising to learn that your social habit might be affecting your health negatively.,false
109,Client,"Yes, indeed. When filling out the form, I checked ""No"" for tobacco use because I didn't see myself as a smoker.",false
109,Therapist,"Now that you recognize yourself as a tobacco user with potential serious health effects, how do you feel about this?",false
109,Client,"I'm very concerned. I don’t want to develop any severe conditions like cancer. Until now, I never really saw myself as a smoker.",false
109,Therapist,The good news is that stopping smoking can reverse the damage from nicotinic stomatitis and halt other potential diseases.,false
109,Client,Really?,false
109,Therapist,"Yes, would you be interested in exploring quitting?",false
109,Client,Absolutely. I didn't realize I was a smoker until now.,false
109,Therapist,"On a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is not confident at all and 10 is very confident, how likely do you think you are to quit if you tried?",false
109,Client,"I’d say seven or eight. It's not part of my daily routine, so I feel quite capable of stopping.",false
109,Therapist,What makes you choose a seven or eight instead of a lower number like five?,false
109,Client,"Because it’s not something I need every day. I don’t smoke excessively, and I believe I can quit easily.",false
109,Therapist,"So, to summarize, you've noticed some negative effects from smoking, have health concerns, and are mindful of the financial impact. Yet, you feel confident about quitting if you try. What would be your next step?",false
109,Client,"I’d like more information on how to quit. There are new medications and methods that can make quitting easier, and I really want to stop.",false
109,Therapist,"I'd be happy to provide more information, tips, and suggest support resources for quitting.",false
109,Client,That would be wonderful. Thank you.,false
109,Therapist,I appreciate your openness in discussing this today.,false
109,Client,Thank you.,false
106,Therapist,"I've prescribed an antibiotic for Aiden's ear infection, but it seems he has had several of these infections over the past year.",false
106,Client,Yeah.,false
106,Therapist,That certainly sounds concerning.,false
106,Client,It is quite stressful for both of us; he becomes very upset.,false
106,Therapist,One significant risk factor for frequent ear infections in children is exposure to smoke. Do you smoke?,false
106,Client,"Yes, I do smoke, but I make sure not to do it around him. I try really hard to avoid smoking when he's nearby.",false
106,Therapist,"Despite your efforts, Aiden's recurring ear infections suggest he might still be exposed to smoke. Could we explore how that might happen?",false
106,Client,"I honestly don't know. I'm very careful; I never smoke in the car or when he's home. I go outside to smoke instead. I understand it's harmful and want to protect him, so I try my best not to expose him to it.",false
106,Therapist,"It's crucial for both your health and Aiden's that you consider quitting smoking. Smoke exposure is linked to ear infections, dental cavities, behavior issues, asthma, and other respiratory problems in children. Additionally, children of smokers are more likely to start smoking themselves. Do you want him to follow in those footsteps?",false
106,Client,"No, but I don't smoke around him. I've thought about quitting before, but it's just so difficult; I'm not sure how to go about it.",false
106,Therapist,"This might be the right time for you to quit. Continuing to smoke poses risks to both of you, including lung cancer and heart disease.",false
106,Client,I understand all that; people have told me before. It's just hard to know where to start or how to do it.,false
106,Therapist,"There are many resources available now that can help make quitting easier than ever. You could try nicotine replacement therapies like patches, lozenges, gum, inhalers, or nasal sprays. Medications such as Chantix and Zyban are options too, along with support groups and hotlines.",false
106,Client,I just don't have the time for any of that right now.,false
106,Therapist,"Quitting is essential, and it's important to prioritize this for your well-being and Aiden's health.",false
106,Client,"I understand its importance; everyone has challenges, though. It's really difficult.",false
106,Therapist,What could be more significant than the health of your child?,false
106,Client,I don't know.,false
106,Therapist,I need you to commit to quitting smoking because it's crucial for both of you.,false
106,Client,I'll look into those options and talk to my doctor about them; maybe I can find something that works.,false
106,Therapist,"It's important to take this seriously, as your continued smoking endangers both yourself and Aiden.",false
106,Client,"Okay, whatever.",false
106,Therapist,Alright.,false
112,Therapist,"Chris, I wanted to have a conversation with you. As one of our standout athletes and valued team members, it's part of my role as Athletic Director to monitor players' well-being and performance. Recently, there was some talk about a party you attended over the weekend, and I'd like to discuss how alcohol fits into your life at this time.",false
112,Client,"Sure, actually, there's something else that's been on my mind lately. Before that party, as you know, I'm an honor student, and my parents have kept me quite sheltered from social activities.",false
112,Therapist,Mm-hmm.,false
112,Client,"About a month ago, my friends invited me to a party, using the fact that I'm always busy with homework and studying as leverage. That's when I started drinking after convincing my parents to let me stay overnight at my friend's house.",false
112,Therapist,Mm-hmm.,false
112,Client,"It was an unusual experience for me. At least it seemed fun in the moment, so I continued doing it. Last weekend, instead of preparing for an exam, I asked my mom to let me attend another party. She suspected what I might do and asked me to promise no alcohol or drugs if she picked me up by 12:00. Surprisingly, that's when the party usually starts, but I thought I could delay her. When she finally came to pick me up, she immediately noticed I had been drinking vodka. I felt terrible for breaking my mother’s trust.",false
112,Therapist,"So, you've always excelled academically and athletically, following expectations until recently when you began engaging more with the party scene.",false
112,Client,Right.,false
112,Therapist,"Initially, it seemed enjoyable, but now you're starting to see some consequences.",false
112,Client,"Yes, I've noticed feeling more lethargic and indifferent towards my schoolwork lately.",false
112,Therapist,Mm-hmm.,false
112,Client,"In class, I often find myself distracted, especially on weekends when I should be studying. Instead, I spend time with friends figuring out how to obtain alcohol based on their age.",false
112,Therapist,It sounds like your focus has shifted significantly. What do you enjoy about drinking?,false
112,Client,"Well, I'm naturally reserved unless it's related to sports or socializing. Drinking helps me relax and makes it easier for me to engage with others.",false
112,Therapist,"So, alcohol helps you feel more at ease and open up.",false
112,Client,Exactly.,false
112,Therapist,"However, there are some negative aspects too, like your mom getting upset, decreased focus, and struggles in school—perhaps other things?",false
112,Client,"Yes, I've also noticed changes in my social circles. Different groups of friends or acquaintances have emerged because they're associated with that lifestyle.",false
112,Therapist,"So, the friendships you had before are experiencing some tension now.",false
112,Client,"A bit, since not all my friends share those interests. I find myself spending more time with a new group who invited me to that first party. But it feels unfair to them when I'm not as present as I used to be.",false
112,Therapist,Okay.,false
112,Client,"They've been there for me, and I want to reciprocate that support.",false
112,Therapist,"Considering how your friendships, studies, and relationship with your mom are being affected, what do you think is the next step?",false
112,Client,"I feel it's time to stop. I'm not naive; I know these situations will arise, but I need to prevent them from escalating to where I can't remember the night before or end up vomiting.",false
112,Therapist,Mm-hmm.,false
112,Client,It's crucial for me to rebuild my mother’s trust gradually because that was a significant blow to her and to me.,false
112,Therapist,Your mom clearly means a lot to you.,false
112,Client,Of course.,false
112,Therapist,"And how she feels about you is important too, right?",false
112,Client,Exactly. That's why it's vital for me to adjust my drinking habits or even quit altogether.,false
112,Therapist,"How confident are you in your ability to change your drinking behavior, whether by cutting down or quitting entirely?",false
112,Client,"I'm quite confident, especially given the circumstances.",false
112,Therapist,"On a scale from 1 to 10, where one is not at all and ten is completely confident, what number would you give yourself?",false
112,Client,"Probably an eight or nine. It can't be a perfect ten because life has many variables, but I'm determined to make this change.",false
112,Therapist,Why did you choose eight or nine instead of six or seven?,false
112,Client,Because I feel strongly about making sure this happens. I don’t want to relive the guilt of betraying my mother or the unpleasantness of vomiting.,false
112,Therapist,Mm-hmm.,false
112,Client,"It's not an experience I wish to repeat. Even if I do drink, I don't want it to lead to those extremes. The fun doesn't outweigh the consequences.",false
112,Therapist,What do you think is a realistic goal for you moving forward?,false
112,Client,"First, I need to regain my mother’s trust and then focus on my studies. If there's time for leisure, I'll join friends at parties but without drinking. One drink won’t harm me, but I’d prefer not to have any.",false
112,Therapist,So your aim is either to abstain completely or limit yourself to one drink if you're at a party?,false
112,Client,Exactly. It allows me to participate socially without overindulging.,false
112,Therapist,"Chris, thank you for sharing this with me. It's clear that it’s been on your mind, and I genuinely care about your well-being as both a student and an athlete. I'm glad we could discuss this, and it seems like you have a solid plan to avoid alcohol or limit yourself to one drink if necessary.",false
112,Client,And thank you for listening. Your support means a lot to me.,false
112,Therapist,"It's my pleasure. Part of my role is to be here for you. Now, I need to get ready for practice.",false
121,Therapist,"It seems like your life is quite fulfilling, with a busy work schedule and active social life. How do you feel about that?",false
121,Client,I'm content with my life as it is.,false
121,Therapist,What aspects of your current lifestyle bring you the most satisfaction?,false
121,Client,"My job keeps me occupied, which I enjoy. Plus, I have a great circle of friends who keep me engaged socially.",false
121,Therapist,Do you find yourself feeling tired or lacking energy at any point during the day?,false
121,Client,"Occasionally, yes. Even after a good night's sleep, there are times when I feel a bit sluggish.",false
121,Therapist,How do you usually cope with those moments when you're feeling low on energy?,false
121,Client,I rely on coffee to help me get through the day and keep my energy levels up.,false
121,Therapist,It sounds like your social interactions play an important role in maintaining your energy. Would you agree?,false
121,Client,"Absolutely, being around friends is a big part of why I enjoy life so much.",false
121,Therapist,How do you feel about making some changes to improve your health and well-being?,false
121,Client,I'm open to it if it means I can continue enjoying my social activities even more.,false
121,Therapist,What are some small steps you think you could take to start improving your health?,false
121,Client,Reducing sugar in my coffee seems like a manageable first step. Maybe joining a club for exercise would also help.,false
121,Therapist,How do you envision these changes impacting your life over the next few years?,false
121,Client,"I hope they'll allow me to stay active and social, maybe even join new clubs or activities that align with my interests.",false
121,Therapist,It sounds like you're ready to take on this challenge. What's your plan moving forward?,false
121,Client,"I'll start by cutting out sugar in my coffee and look into joining a club for some physical activity. Then, I'll check back with my doctor to see how things are going.",false
121,Therapist,That sounds like a solid plan. How do you feel about meeting again soon to discuss your progress?,false
121,Client,I'm up for it. It's good to have someone to talk to and keep me accountable.,false
121,Therapist,Great! Let's set up another appointment in a month to see how things are going.,false
121,Client,Sounds good to me. Thanks for the support.,false
115,Therapist,"Alright, David. Let's start with a rinse and see how you're feeling today.",false
115,Client,I'm okay.,false
115,Therapist,"That's good to hear. Take a look at this for me, and let me know what your thoughts are about it. How does that feel?",false
115,Client,Yeah.,false
115,Therapist,"And the color seems fine? There is quite a bit of staining, so I'm curious if you've considered how smoking might be contributing to this.",false
115,Client,Oh.,false
115,Therapist,Perhaps also coffee or tea could play a role. You're probably familiar with these suggestions.,false
115,Client,"Yes, I do consume all those things.",false
115,Therapist,"Right. Smoking can lead to various negative effects, including dental issues like cavities and slower healing in your mouth.",false
115,Client,Yeah.,false
115,Therapist,So--,false
115,Client,I've heard it all before. But what I really want is to get my teeth fixed.,false
115,Therapist,"Absolutely, and I'm here to support you with that. My goal is to help improve your oral health. There are medications available that can significantly reduce cravings and make quitting easier.",false
115,Client,"I tried a pill once, but it didn't work for me. It was more trouble than it was worth due to the side effects.",false
115,Therapist,"No, David, trying isn’t a waste at all. Studies show people often need about seven attempts before they successfully quit smoking. Consider this as progress towards quitting.",false
115,Client,Or seven lectures along the way.,false
115,Therapist,"I assure you, my intention is not to lecture but to support you. It's understandable that it can feel overwhelming when everyone around you brings it up.",false
115,Client,"Yes, I get defensive because I hear it from my doctor and cardiologist too. I know smoking isn't good for me, but quitting is hard.",false
115,Therapist,"Quitting is indeed challenging, which is why these medications exist. You've been open to trying them once before; would you consider using them again? It's crucial not just for your overall health but specifically for your oral health as well.",false
115,Client,I suppose I need to really want to quit because past attempts have often led to more issues than they resolved.,false
115,Therapist,"The impact of smoking will likely cause more problems than any medication side effects. Trust me on that, David.",false
115,Client,Okay.,false
115,Therapist,It's important to weigh the potential benefits against the risks from smoking.,false
115,Client,Alright. Can I leave now?,false
115,Therapist,"Sure, but before you go—",false
115,Client,"I understand what you're saying, and I appreciate your concern, but I'm not ready to tackle this right now.",false
115,Therapist,Thank you for listening. I genuinely care about your well-being and am concerned about the smoking's impact on your health.,false
115,Client,Okay.,false
115,Therapist,"Remember, I’m here to help whenever you're ready.",false
115,Client,Okay.,false
115,Therapist,"Take care, David.",false
133,Therapist,"Thank you for joining me today. I understand this might be a familiar setting for you, having sat here with others like myself before.",false
133,Client,Mm.,false
133,Therapist,"You've likely gathered some thoughts and experiences from those sessions. Today, I'd like to explore what changes you're considering in your life as we work together over time.",false
133,Client,"Right. Neat. What have I changed, what am I—",false
133,Therapist,"Let's discuss your reflections on getting your life back on track, especially since you've been thinking about it lately.",false
133,Client,I've been contemplating how easy it would be to return to dealing.,false
133,Therapist,Yes.,false
133,Client,"Specifically, how I could set myself up correctly by doing things incorrectly.",false
133,Therapist,It seems like this is a lifestyle you're quite familiar with.,false
133,Client,Mm.,false
133,Therapist,You know the potential for making money and setting yourself up well. But what about the other side? Many who've been in your situation often consider that life can be different. Where do you stand on these thoughts?,false
133,Client,"At the end of my last week inside, I had that ""what's next"" feeling, but it doesn't seem to work out here.",false
133,Therapist,Okay.,false
133,Client,I don’t have a clear idea of what’s next.,false
133,Therapist,"Life outside is quite different from expectations while you were inside, isn't it?",false
133,Client,"Yes, it's worse.",false
133,Therapist,How have you been managing since then? Have you returned to dealing yet?,false
133,Client,Not yet—I mean the offer's there—,false
133,Therapist,It sounds like you still have connections. This isn’t a new challenge for you.,false
133,Client,No.,false
133,Therapist,What has stopped you from returning over these past three weeks and one day?,false
133,Client,I don't know.,false
133,Therapist,You've made a decision not to pick up your old life for 22 days now.,false
133,Client,"Before leaving, I told myself not to. Somehow, I just kept going without knowing why. [clears throat] There's no real reason I haven’t yet. It’s because I don't think it'll work the way I always imagined. If I do that again, the next step is a long one—a very long one.",false
133,Therapist,Okay.,false
133,Client,And I can't go back there. There's no way I'm going back.,false
133,Therapist,"So you're saying if you choose this path, it might be risky but necessary to maintain your relationship with Fiona?",false
133,Client,"Yeah, but my decision was clear—I won’t do that yet.",false
133,Therapist,Yet implies the door is still open at the moment.,false
133,Client,I hate that.,false
133,Therapist,"You'll have to make that call. I can't decide for you, but there are consequences either way—more time possibly and Fiona might not be around if you return to dealing. On the other hand, choosing a different path could mean being with Fiona and transitioning into a new life.",false
133,Client,"Mm, yeah. And we're still no closer.",false
133,Therapist,But at least we're discussing it now.,false
133,Client,Yeah.,false
133,Therapist,How much time have you spent talking about this position with anyone other than Fiona?,false
133,Client,"No time at all, except for about 10 hours with you.",false
133,Therapist,So the fact that we're having this conversation is significant?,false
133,Client,Yeah.,false
133,Therapist,"Let me summarize what I've gathered so far to ensure I'm understanding you correctly. You have a long history of making money through dealing or crime, and Fiona has set clear boundaries—if you return to that lifestyle, she'll leave. Yet, she's stayed with you for nearly 13 years, which is important to you.",false
133,Client,"Yeah, 12, nearly 13.",false
133,Therapist,"It seems easy to fall back into your old ways, but the alternative lifestyle doesn't seem as exciting or straightforward.",false
133,Client,Mm.,false
133,Therapist,"However, it does appear intriguing because it's so different from what you're used to. You're ready for a change.",false
133,Client,"Yeah, it is exciting because it’s new.",false
133,Therapist,Let's consider what the first step might be in this transition.,false
133,Client,Yeah.,false
133,Therapist,You mentioned a friend who turned his back on crime. Perhaps talking with him about how he did it and stayed committed could provide some insight?,false
133,Client,"Uh, ringing him.",false
133,Therapist,It seems surprising to you that reaching out is an option.,false
133,Client,"We were inside together for a long time. I know what he's doing now, but calling might feel odd. He'd probably be okay with it though.",false
133,Therapist,So there’s potential in making that call?,false
133,Client,"Yes, there's possibility.",false
133,Therapist,Fiona has been clear about her expectations and hopes for your relationship.,false
133,Client,"Yeah, I have to do what she says. She has more hope than me.",false
133,Therapist,What would it take for you to start considering some of her hopes and sharing them with her?,false
133,Client,"It's pretty scary stuff, and I wouldn't admit that.",false
133,Therapist,"You mentioned earlier that once you make a decision, you stick to it.",false
133,Client,Yeah.,false
133,Therapist,"If you decide to pursue this new path, despite the fear, it seems important given your relationship. Let’s explore what it might take for you to commit to her hopes and dreams.",false
133,Client,I understand my decision not to deal yet was clear—I need to really know what that means if I'm going to make a change. It's not just about talking; I need a solid plan before reaching out to him.,false
133,Therapist,That makes sense. You're considering the effort required for this path and how it might feel lonely. Who else could walk with you on this journey?,false
133,Client,"There’s Fiona, but she’s also trying to figure things out. Dad's not much help either. It seems like just Fiona.",false
133,Therapist,Perhaps they can join you on this road too if you decide that's the path for you.,false
8,Therapist,"What brings you here today, Bob? How can I assist you?",false
8,Client,"Well, my wife thinks I have a smoking problem. I've smoked all my life, and six months ago, she started this health kick where everyone who smokes is seen as bad. That's why I'm here—to appease her.",false
8,Therapist,"It sounds like coming here wasn't your first choice, especially since you'd rather be doing something else today.",false
8,Client,Absolutely. An understatement would be an understatement. I should actually be at work right now.,false
8,Therapist,"You've taken time off work, which means this is costing you both time and money.",false
8,Client,"Yes, I'm here only because my wife insisted. It's been six months of constant nagging since she quit smoking herself, and now it's my turn to quit.",false
8,Therapist,What concerns does your wife have about your smoking?,false
8,Client,She worries about my health and shows me articles on second-hand smoke.,false
8,Therapist,"So, she’s been actively sharing these with you for you to read?",false
8,Client,"Yes, I'm assigned to read them at breakfast. We used to enjoy a cigarette together, but now I must go outside in this weather. It feels unfair since she smoked more than me and now acts like she's superior.",false
8,Therapist,You seem quite upset about being pressured into changing your lifestyle because of her decision six months ago.,false
8,Client,"And my kids are on her side too, it’s like they're all against me.",false
8,Therapist,"From your perspective, do you see any consequences to your smoking?",false
8,Client,"The biggest one is how it affects my wife and family. My dad still smokes at 85, but I've thought about quitting before, though I'm not sure if I can.",false
8,Therapist,"Let me summarize the situation: Your wife and kids are pressuring you, leaving you feeling isolated with no choice in the matter. You have some health concerns, but it seems like you'd prefer things to return to how they were before she quit smoking. Is that accurate?",false
8,Client,"Yes, I just don't want to lose my family over this.",false
8,Therapist,It sounds like your relationship is very important to you and you would do anything to maintain it.,false
8,Client,"We've been married for over 25 years without major issues. This feels like the first real problem, though I'm not sure if it's a big deal since we both used to smoke. But now, things are changing, and I worry about what might happen next.",false
8,Therapist,"It seems like you're viewing this as an all-or-nothing situation—either continue smoking and face more issues or quit entirely right away. Perhaps there’s a middle ground where you can gradually reduce your smoking, similar to how it took time to start.",false
8,Client,"So, I could do it gradually?",false
8,Therapist,"Yes, there are medications and approaches that allow for a gradual change, recognizing that it will take some time and practice.",false
8,Client,My wife wants me to stop immediately. Do you think she could join us in a future session to hear this perspective?,false
8,Therapist,"If you'd like your wife to come along, I’d be happy to discuss this with both of you.",false
8,Client,I'll need to check her schedule since it changes weekly. I’ll call back tomorrow to arrange something.,false
8,Therapist,That sounds good.,false
8,Client,All right.,false
8,Therapist,Thank you for coming in today.,false
8,Client,"Okay, thank you.",false
20,Therapist,"I've prescribed antibiotics for Aiden, but I wanted to discuss a couple of concerns. It seems he's had several ear infections recently, and your chart indicates smoking in the home. Could you share more about that?",false
20,Client,"Sure. It's just me and him at home, and yes, I do smoke. I try my best not to smoke around him, but with everything being so stressful—being a single mom and working full-time—it’s challenging.",false
20,Therapist,"You're juggling many responsibilities, and smoking seems like one way you cope with stress.",false
20,Client,Exactly. Some people unwind with wine; I use cigarettes.,false
20,Therapist,It sounds like you make an effort to avoid smoking around him. What led you to that decision?,false
20,Client,"I'm aware of the risks, especially concerning ear infections and asthma. But other kids have issues too, even when their parents don't smoke.",false
20,Therapist,"So, on one hand, you're concerned about how your smoking might affect him, but on the other, you question if it's truly the cause?",false
20,Client,"Yes, that’s right. He doesn’t have asthma or many problems like some of his friends do. I've considered quitting before, but it seems impossible at this moment.",false
20,Therapist,What motivated you to quit smoking during your pregnancy?,false
20,Client,"When he was in my womb, we were sharing everything. The thought of him being affected by my smoking was too much for me to bear.",false
20,Therapist,"Right now, though, quitting feels almost unmanageable or overwhelming?",false
20,Client,"Yes, exactly.",false
20,Therapist,How did you manage to quit before?,false
20,Client,"Honestly, I don't remember the specifics. It just felt necessary at that time because of all the risks associated with smoking during pregnancy.",false
20,Therapist,The potential consequences were frightening enough for you to stop then?,false
20,Client,Absolutely.,false
20,Therapist,But those fears don’t seem as pressing now?,false
20,Client,"No, we're two separate people now. I do my best not to smoke around him and prevent others from doing so too.",false
20,Therapist,You’re making a genuine effort in that regard.,false
20,Client,Yes.,false
20,Therapist,"Yet, it seems like part of you really wants to quit?",false
20,Client,"Definitely. I know it's important, and every New Year, I resolve to quit, but something always gets in the way.",false
20,Therapist,"Quitting is on your list of goals, but it hasn’t reached the top yet?",false
20,Client,"Yes, that’s right.",false
20,Therapist,"On a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 means you're not confident at all and 10 means you feel very certain about quitting, where do you see yourself now?",false
20,Client,"Probably around a 5. I know it's possible because I've done it before, but it feels daunting right now.",false
20,Therapist,Why did you choose five instead of two or three?,false
20,Client,"I'm aware of the negative impacts on my health and don't want him to think smoking is acceptable. But despite knowing this, quitting seems really hard at the moment.",false
20,Therapist,"So, you have strong reasons for wanting to quit, you've succeeded before, but currently feel uncertain about your ability to do it again?",false
20,Client,"Yes, that's accurate.",false
20,Therapist,What would be our next step?,false
20,Client,I'm not sure. I'd like some guidance on what kind of help might work for me.,false
20,Therapist,"If you're open to it, there are several new options available that can increase your chances of success in quitting. There are medications and other methods we could explore.",false
20,Client,I’m not keen on taking medicine.,false
20,Therapist,"That's understandable. Alternatively, there are support groups and classes where you can connect with others who are also trying to quit. Sometimes having that community support is crucial, especially when smoking serves as a stress reliever for you.",false
20,Client,"That sounds supportive, but I'm uncertain if I have the time for it all.",false
20,Therapist,It does seem like something that might require significant time commitment and may not fit into your current schedule. Let's explore options that could work within your lifestyle.,false
20,Client,That would be helpful.,false
20,Therapist,"If you're willing, we can arrange another meeting to discuss these possibilities further.",false
20,Client,I'd appreciate that. Thank you.,false
20,Therapist,You’re welcome.,false
11,Therapist,What other factors have led you to seek help today?,false
11,Client,They found a small bag of weed.,false
11,Therapist,I see.,false
11,Client,"It wasn't much, though.",false
11,Therapist,Understood.,false
11,Client,I wasn’t planning on selling it or anything like that. It's just—,false
11,Therapist,So you had it for personal use?,false
11,Client,"Yeah, whatever. It’s California; no one really cares.",false
11,Therapist,"Right, right, right.",false
11,Client,How long is this process going to take?,false
11,Therapist,"Well, today we have about 15 to 20 minutes to talk. This is just the beginning of several sessions over the next six months. It's natural for you to wonder how much time it will take. Is there anything else you’d like me to know about your perspective that might help us work together effectively?",false
11,Client,"I just want to get whatever needs doing, done.",false
11,Therapist,So you're focused on what you need to do to move past this?,false
11,Client,Yeah.,false
11,Therapist,"Okay. If it's alright with you, we have a form that can help us outline some ideas for our agenda together. This way, I can better support your goal of moving beyond this situation. Does now feel like a good time to start figuring out where we might go from here?",false
14,Therapist,"So, just to clarify, your main goal is to continue enjoying these things but in a more moderate way?",false
14,Client,"Yeah, I suppose that's right.",false
14,Therapist,"That makes sense. Since this seems very important to you, on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 means not confident at all and 10 means extremely confident, how would you rate your confidence in starting this new plan right now?",false
14,Client,"Right now, I think I'd say about a six.",false
14,Therapist,A six. And what might cause that number to drop when you're home with the food around?,false
14,Client,It probably goes down to a four then.,false
14,Therapist,"Okay, let's consider we're at a four for now. What do you think keeps your confidence from being even lower, like a zero or one?",false
14,Client,Because I've wanted this change for years ever since I became more aware of my body.,false
14,Therapist,I see.,false
14,Client,"Ever since I was a teenager, really. It's always been a goal because all my friends are into soccer and hiking, they're very fit and healthy.",false
14,Therapist,Got it.,false
14,Client,"And here I am not like that, but I want to be healthy and active, maybe even look nice.",false
14,Therapist,"So, what do you think could help boost your confidence in this area? That seems crucial for us to focus on. What might make you feel more assured about achieving this goal?",false
14,Client,"Honestly, I'm not sure. I guess I know I need to keep reminding myself that it's something I've wanted for years.",false
14,Therapist,Mm-hmm.,false
14,Client,"Like, I can do it because I want to and have always wanted to.",false
14,Therapist,Okay.,false
14,Client,I believe I can achieve anything. It's just hard to actually start doing it.,false
14,Therapist,"Understood. If you're okay with this, let's set aside changing your eating habits for a moment. Can we reflect on another time in your life when you wanted something and achieved it? What strengths did you use that helped you overcome the challenge and succeed?",false
26,Therapist,Could you share what's been happening lately?,false
26,Client,I just want my phone call back. That's all.,false
26,Therapist,I understand. It seems your phone privileges were removed.,false
26,Client,"[scoffs] Yeah, that's right.",false
26,Therapist,Can you tell me more about what led to this decision?,false
26,Client,"I'm not sure. One of the officers seems to have it out for me or something. Maybe because I didn't make my bed or due to some attitude issue. Honestly, I don't know; all I want is my phone call.",false
26,Therapist,"That must be confusing, especially since you've been a model resident here—always making your bed and being respectful of staff and fellow residents. Could this have something to do with your upcoming release in three weeks? It sounds like it's quite challenging for you.",false
26,Client,I just want to talk to my mom.,false
26,Therapist,"Yes, you used to speak with her almost every other night, but now it's been about a week without contact. That must be really tough. You mentioned your dad's birthday is coming up, right?",false
26,Client,My dad's birthday is tomorrow.,false
26,Therapist,I see.,false
26,Client,And I just wanted my call so I could talk to my mom. That's all.,false
26,Therapist,"It's been a while since we've seen this kind of behavior from you, and it's understandable that as your release approaches, feelings of anxiety or frustration might arise due to the anticipation of returning to life outside. Do you think something like that might be affecting you?",false
32,Therapist,"To summarize, according to the Minnesota State, Mankato security report, you were stopped on Stadium Road last Friday for driving under the influence and then taken to detox. You're also 21 years old soon. Does that sound accurate?",false
32,Client,"I guess so, but honestly, it's been a week, and I was quite drunk, so my memory is fuzzy.",false
32,Therapist,It seems like this kind of behavior could lead to suspension. Do you find that concerning at all?,false
32,Client,"Not really. I'll be 21 in a few months, so after that, they can't cite me as a minor. Plus, I'm not much of a drinker compared to my friends—I don’t get wasted. I just need to be more careful and avoid getting caught. I’m trying to live like any normal college student.",false
32,Therapist,What were you thinking when you decided to drive after having six beers? You could have caused an accident or hurt someone.,false
32,Client,"Whatever, but that didn't happen. I called my roommates for a ride, but he was too sleepy. So, I had no choice but to get home somehow. This isn’t really on me—I often give him rides, and nothing bad happened.",false
32,Therapist,"It's important to take responsibility for your actions. If this kind of partying continues, you might face serious consequences like legal fees, poor grades, health issues, or even being expelled from school, which could disappoint your parents. Do you want any of that to happen?",false
32,Client,"No, not at all. Like I said, it's not my fault. Are we done here? I have a class in 15 minutes.",false
32,Therapist,"Your actions don't align with what Minnesota State University expects from its students. To continue as a student here, you'll need to demonstrate that you can adhere to our rules. Do you think you can manage that, or do you risk suspension?",false
32,Client,"Look, I really enjoy going out and I understand your points. You're making some valid arguments, and I’ll give them some thought.",false
32,Therapist,"Understood. Your sanction is being placed on university disciplinary probation, and you'll need to attend an alcohol education seminar costing $150. Keep in mind that any further violations could lead to a suspension for at least one semester or longer.",false
32,Client,"$150? Are you serious? I can't afford that. Alright, I'm done with this conversation. I’m over it.",false
23,Therapist,"Hi, Hannah. It's a pleasure to meet you.",false
23,Client,Hi.,false
23,Therapist,I understand that your GP referred you due to some challenges with anxiety. Is that correct?,false
23,Client,"Yeah. Um, yeah, it kind of started like five, six years ago.",false
23,Therapist,I see.,false
23,Client,"Um, it kind of escalated a bit. Um, I've just recently moved out from living with my parents. So just made it a bit worse, I think.",false
23,Therapist,Okay. Is this the first time you're living independently?,false
23,Client,"Yeah, I am- Yeah. It's the first time actually, yeah. Um, I was going to move a few years ago. I just thought it'd be easier to stay at home, so.",false
23,Therapist,Okay. So moving out has been quite significant for you and seems to have prompted your visit to the GP.,false
23,Client,Yeah.,false
23,Therapist,How has this transition affected you?,false
23,Client,"Um, don't know, it's kind of, I haven't really told anyone, so, I mean, it's made it like better in sense. I feel, hopefully this is, this is it like, it- it'll help, but I don't know. I don't like thinking that I've like have to do this. I never thought I'd be the kind of person who would need to seek help if that makes sense.",false
23,Therapist,Okay. How are you feeling about being here today?,false
23,Client,"It's like scared. I don't know. Hopefully, it will help.",false
23,Therapist,So you're feeling a bit anxious about our session today.,false
23,Client,Yeah.,false
23,Therapist,"Let’s revisit why you visited the GP and how that led to coming here. You've been dealing with anxiety for some time, but moving out recently seems to have intensified things. How did this change affect you after moving?",false
23,Client,"Um, I thought they'd be better, but 'cause I thought I'd have to kind of be independent and I suppose actually a lot worse. So I'm-I'm just kind of staying in the house a lot. I don't really have any friends or anything. I mean my family come and visit a bit, but it's not-- I don't know. It's kind of scary because I've just been kind of-- that should just end up flying by myself, which I always thought I'd like, but I don't actually like it.",false
23,Therapist,Okay. What other challenges have you been facing?,false
23,Client,"Um, I mean, I'm-I'm a photographer. Um, so I kind of-- It's-it's been stopping me a bit, my anxiety, from being able to get work and because every time, you know, there's, uh, an opportunity that is kind of involving me having to interact with people, I just tend to just turn it down. So it was kind of making things hard in that respect and um, just kind of friends wise and everything. I just feel like I'm just kind of increasingly more alone. So it's kind of stopping me from making friends and, you know, like relationships and stuff.",false
23,Therapist,"Okay. It sounds like your anxiety is hindering certain activities for you. This includes taking on specific work opportunities as a freelance photographer, which can be challenging, and socially, it seems to be affecting your ability to form new friendships and connections.",false
23,Client,"Yeah, yeah. Um, it was kind of easier when I was at home because I was obviously, I mean, my parents, so it's fine, but you know, they would, I'd go to places with, um, or I'd kind of have people there, but more and more, I'm just finding myself just staying in a lot. I mean-- I went like two weeks ago for coffee with my friends and the whole time I was just kind of wanting to go home again. So I don't, I just don't want to-- I don't want that to happen. I don't want to lose everyone. So-",false
23,Therapist,It sounds like you're concerned about where this might lead.,false
23,Client,"Yeah. Um, yeah.",false
23,Therapist,"You mentioned the anxiety began around five or six years ago. That would have been when you were about 19, correct?",false
23,Client,Yeah.,false
23,Therapist,What was happening in your life at that time?,false
23,Client,"Uh, I guess I'd finished school about a year before that. Um, and I mean, I-I've always been a bit shy, um, at school, but it was never ever, uh, like it didn't really affect the things as much as not at all as much as it has been doing the last few years ago, I guess. It just started when my friends went to university, and, I don't know, I felt like I was expected to kind of move out or do something and then it just kind of escalated from there. I just stop going to parties or I'd just say no to invitations or I don't know, I thought my job would help because I mean, I love it. I've- I really like doing photography, but I'm just kind of getting less and less work as it goes on, so, which is my thing, you know, but—",false
23,Therapist,What aspects of your work are most challenging for you?,false
23,Client,"I guess when it- I have to kind of be working with other people. Um, I don't like that. It's like when I'm trying to kind of- would do an event or something where there's a lot of people there, not just photographers, but actual, you know, if I'm like taking places with people that I don't know, I just kind of find myself saying, you know, I mean, I want to do them, but just is scary. So I just don't do it.",false
23,Therapist,Can you tell me more about what happens when you receive an invitation for a job involving social interaction? What thoughts come to mind?,false
23,Client,"Um, just, I mean, I get really hot and sweaty, and I don't-- I feel like everyone's kind of looking at me and thinking that I'm just like really stupid, and I feel like they're all going to be staring and thinking, I just can't do my job. And I'm just an idiot. And I mean, they'll think that I just look like a weirdo and I just try and-- I mean, I just kind of just try and get out of the situation or just focus on something else. So that's why I like doing shots where it's just me and the camera 'cause I- then I can just put all my attention on that instead of having to, you know, be with other people.",false
23,Therapist,It sounds like there are many thoughts about what others might think when you receive such an invitation. How does this affect your feelings?,false
23,Client,"Um, just makes me feel like an idiot, makes me feel like I just shouldn't even bother trying to do it anymore. I should just go home and I just-- I think I just don't want to be in that situation. I just feel like everyone else is fine and they're normal and I'm just the freak, you can't, like do normal things and—",false
23,Therapist,Can you share a recent example of when this happened?,false
23,Client,"Um, like a work situation or just--?",false
23,Therapist,"Yes, perhaps an instance where you were working with others and felt your social anxiety kick in.",false
23,Client,"Yeah. I was doing a job where it was kind of like a- a Nature issue and I was having to work with a lot of different people. Um, and, um, when they told me about the job, I thought it would be fine. I thought it was just going to be a few other photographers, but there were actually people and, you know, I was taking photos of people kind of in the trees and stuff like that. And I guess- they asked me to, um—",false
23,Therapist,Was this related to fashion photography?,false
23,Client,"Yeah. Yeah. It was a fashion thing. I think it was for some kind of-- I'm not sure if it was a campaign or something, but, it was-",false
23,Therapist,Okay.,false
23,Client,"Yeah, it was, yeah, it was really cool, but I find it- found it really hard to try and focus on that 'cause I was so- I was kind of feeling really anxious and—",false
23,Therapist,So the situation wasn't what you expected?,false
23,Client,No. No.,false
23,Therapist,How long ago did this occur?,false
23,Client,That was two weeks ago.,false
23,Therapist,It sounds like it happened quite recently.,false
23,Client,Yeah.,false
23,Therapist,"On that day, what thoughts were going through your mind during the situation?",false
23,Client,"I just felt really- just really kind of hot. I couldn't really breathe and just felt like I wanted to just get out. And I was kind of trying really, really hard to just focus, and just, you know, like kind of hold the camera and just not think about anything, but I just felt like everyone was looking at me and like, when they'd say 'action' and they're trying to get me to start and I was just felt like everyone was just thinking I was really stupid and I shouldn't have been there and—",false
23,Therapist,It seems discussing this is making you feel anxious.,false
23,Client,Yeah.,false
23,Therapist,"You mentioned feeling hot and sweaty, holding the camera tightly. Can you tell me more about that?",false
23,Client,Yeah.,false
23,Therapist,Was it a way to hide or focus better?,false
23,Client,"I was just trying to focus on it. I was just thinking if I could just hold it really tightly, it would just-- I don't know. I'd kind of just be able to just get through it and just focus.",false
23,Therapist,So holding the camera tightly helped you manage your feelings?,false
23,Client,"Cause I felt like I was getting really like hot and flushed and I just thought, at least if I can just-- I don't know. It sounds weird, but I was just trying to keep my hands still on it. 'Cause my hands were kind of sweaty and like shaking like loads, like, and I could just tell everyone was looking and they could see, and I just thought if I just managed to hold onto it, it wouldn't be as noticeable, but—",false
23,Therapist,It sounds like you had many thoughts about others noticing your anxiety. What else were you thinking?,false
23,Client,"Just-- I was just, just stupid and it was just really-- just felt really like kind of- like everyone was just going to be staring and just thinking that I-- Like- I just felt like everyone was looking at me and just, they could tell. And then just thinking of what was she doing?",false
23,Therapist,They could see you were—,false
23,Client,Yeah.,false
23,Therapist,Okay.,false
23,Client,"Yeah, um, I was trying to wear black so this kind of tries to cover it up and just like a lot of layers, so they can't tell but, I mean, my hands, like, they were so shaken. I was really red and just was-- Just wishing that I just wasn't there.",false
23,Therapist,How did you try to manage how you looked during this experience?,false
23,Client,"I think just very stupid and, like, I think my face was really red. I could feel it flushing and I knew that I'd- I was probably sweating and shaking, like my hands were definitely really really shaking. Um, and af-- it was, like definitely really noticeable. Everyone could definitely see.",false
23,Therapist,How did you attempt to conceal these feelings?,false
23,Client,"Um, well, I again was trying to grip the camera, just look down, just trying not to do anything weird or-- 'Cause, I mean, they could probably tell I was being weird anyway, but hopefully if-- I just- I just tried really hard to just focus and look down, not trying, like not kind-- look at anyone else and just, yeah, just kind of trying get on with it as best as I could, but—",false
23,Therapist,So you avoided eye contact and wore black in preparation.,false
23,Client,"Yeah, no, I-I always do that even if it's really hot or I wear just loads of layers and just 'cause otherwise I- I'll just be really sweaty and like, people would definitely be able to see, so.",false
23,Therapist,How did the situation conclude?,false
23,Client,"Um, well, it kind of went on for like an hour or so, and then, um, people were going, um, just a-after every shoot people go out for drinks after just to kind of celebrate like that we've done it. I'd just- I went home straight away, just got on my car and went home. I just didn't want to be around them especially after they would've seen me being weird and I just wanted to get-get home straight away.",false
23,Therapist,Okay.,false
35,Therapist,"Hello, Natalie. I'm Dawn.",false
35,Client,"Hi, Dawn. Nice to meet you.",false
35,Therapist,It's a pleasure meeting you too. Thank you for coming in today.,false
35,Client,Thank you for having me.,false
35,Therapist,Of course. Could you share a bit about yourself?,false
35,Client,"Sure. I’m 28 and moved to Arizona six months ago. I love spending time with my family and friends when possible, though work keeps me quite busy. Lately, I've been wanting to make changes in my diet and physical activity because I'm not satisfied with my current weight. That's why I thought it would be helpful to talk about these things.",false
35,Therapist,It sounds like you're feeling a bit dissatisfied with your health habits?,false
35,Client,"Yes, exactly. I’ve noticed that I feel more sluggish lately, and my mood has been affected too. At first, I thought the colder weather was to blame, but now I believe it might be related to my lack of activity and diet.",false
35,Therapist,"So you're experiencing low energy levels, and in the past, when you were more active and ate differently, you felt more energized?",false
35,Client,"Yes, particularly during times when I was very active. That's when I noticed a significant boost in both my energy and mood.",false
35,Therapist,Could you tell me more about those previous periods of being active?,false
35,Client,"Well, playing sports in college kept me busy and it was enjoyable. Looking back, I'm amazed at how much I managed to fit into a day because being physically active gave me so much mental and physical energy. It allowed me to balance school full-time with socializing.",false
35,Therapist,"You had such abundant energy that you felt unstoppable, like the Energizer Bunny.",false
35,Client,"Exactly! Now it's different. After work, I'm usually exhausted, and it takes a lot for me to want to be physically active after spending all day at my desk. So, unwinding by watching Netflix is often what happens instead.",false
35,Therapist,"Your days are full now with your career, but your energy levels aren't what they used to be. Do you have any thoughts on why this might have changed?",false
35,Client,"I think part of it is that in college, being active was mandatory for my scholarship and team commitments. Now there's no external obligation, though I do feel an urgency to change things. It’s not just about going to the gym; it's more about actually doing it.",false
35,Therapist,"So previously, you didn't have a choice about being physically active—it was required. Now, it's up to you, and you're reflecting on recent years with the desire to make different choices regarding activity.",false
35,Client,"Yes, that’s right. I don’t want to run marathons, but incorporating some physical activity could improve my outlook and energy levels.",false
35,Therapist,That sounds beneficial. You've noticed a positive impact of exercise on your mood?,false
35,Client,"Definitely. When I'm active, I feel happier and more upbeat, with a generally more positive outlook. Even small things like sitting in traffic don't bother me as much if I’ve been active that day.",false
35,Therapist,So you feel more accomplished and less bothered by minor annoyances when you're physically active?,false
35,Client,"Yes, exactly.",false
35,Therapist,"Let's summarize what we've discussed. You moved to Arizona six months ago and are trying to establish new routines. Reflecting on your college years as an athlete, you realize that now it’s up to you to choose physical activity. Not being active has impacted both your energy levels and mood, which you'd like to improve.",false
35,Client,"Yes, and I'm also not happy with my weight. If I can increase my activity level, I hope it will positively affect my nutrition too.",false
35,Therapist,Could you tell me more about your concerns regarding your weight? When did you start feeling dissatisfied with your body?,false
35,Client,"About three to four months ago. My clothes started fitting tighter and I wasn't comfortable with how I looked, which was new for me since I've generally been okay with my appearance.",false
35,Therapist,It seems like a cycle where the lack of physical activity has affected your self-confidence. Do you think this is part of what's happening now compared to before?,false
35,Client,"Yes, I believe both my level of activity and my diet are contributing to how I view myself.",false
35,Therapist,"So until recently, you had strong self-confidence and a positive body image, and you're hoping to return to that place where you feel good about yourself.",false
35,Client,"Yes, exactly.",false
38,Therapist,"Hi, Sarah, it's wonderful to meet you. I'm Delwyn, a counselor here at the clinic. Your nurse practitioner mentioned that smoking and alcohol use were discussed during your recent annual exam. Could you share more about what was said?",false
38,Client,"Yeah, um, last week I met with my nurse practitioner, and she seems concerned about how much I smoke and drink right now. I mean, I-I did agree to work on reducing my smoking, but as for drinking, I don't really think it's excessive.",false
38,Therapist,"So, you've decided to reduce your smoking a bit, but you're not particularly worried about your drinking habits?",false
38,Client,"Right, I don't drink excessively and honestly, it helps me relax.",false
38,Therapist,It sounds like drinking is a way for you to unwind.,false
38,Client,"Yeah, exactly. It's kind of my ""me time"" at the end of the day.",false
38,Therapist,A chance to escape from your busy schedule.,false
38,Client,"Yeah. I have a two-year-old son and work full-time, plus I've started going back to school. Juggling all that is exhausting, so by the end of the day, I just want to relax and enjoy myself.",false
38,Therapist,So you're balancing work with being a single mom and attending school?,false
38,Client,"Yeah, and at my job as a server, I'm on my feet all day, which is really tiring.",false
38,Therapist,That sounds like exhausting work.,false
38,Client,"Yeah, it's challenging to please customers all day while worrying if I'm making enough money for my son.",false
38,Therapist,So you're not only managing physically demanding work and school but also concerned about your finances?,false
38,Client,"Yeah, and with going back to school, I have to figure out how to pay for everything. It's just a lot right now.",false
38,Therapist,That does sound overwhelming. It makes sense that you feel the need for some form of break or reward.,false
38,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
38,Therapist,"Could you tell me more about your drinking habits? How much do you drink, what patterns have emerged, and why was there concern?",false
38,Client,"Well, I don't really understand what raised concern. I mean, I don't drink that much—I've gone up to maybe two drinks a day at most.",false
38,Therapist,So you're having about two drinks daily. Are you familiar with the recommended drinking levels for women?,false
38,Client,Not much.,false
38,Therapist,Would you be interested in learning about those recommendations?,false
38,Client,Sure.,false
38,Therapist,"The recommendation is no more than three drinks per day and seven over a week to reduce risks like accidents, chronic diseases, or psychological issues. What are your thoughts on that?",false
38,Client,I don't know; it surprises me because two drinks a day doesn't seem risky. My family members drink much more without problems.,false
38,Therapist,"It seems normal to you, especially when compared with your family's habits.",false
38,Client,"No. Honestly, I'm getting annoyed because I agreed to work on my smoking, but now everything I enjoy is being questioned. If I stop drinking, what will I have left for enjoyment?",false
38,Therapist,You really need that reward or relaxation.,false
38,Client,"Yeah, yeah.",false
38,Therapist,It also seems like your drinking might have increased a bit over time?,false
38,Client,"Yeah, probably due to stress. I'm in my second semester of school now, and it's overwhelming. Plus, childcare is an issue since my mom can't always watch my son.",false
38,Therapist,"So the more stressed you feel, the more you drink?",false
38,Client,"Yeah, I guess that's right.",false
38,Therapist,"Let me summarize what we've discussed. You have a very stressful life and need some form of reward or stress relief. Meanwhile, your drinking has increased over time, especially when you're stressed. Have you noticed any issues from your drinking?",false
38,Client,"No specific problems, but sometimes I feel guilty wanting to unwind with drinks instead of spending more time with my son.",false
38,Therapist,"So in the evenings, it's tempting to drink and perhaps miss out on things that matter more to you?",false
38,Client,Yeah.,false
38,Therapist,And that doesn't feel good?,false
38,Client,No.,false
38,Therapist,"It seems like there's a dilemma because while occasional drinking isn't an issue, it's the amount and its interference with important aspects of your life that are concerning. You haven't seen it this way before.",false
38,Client,"Yeah. It's hard to accept right now. I've never thought about it like this, so I'm worried.",false
38,Therapist,Changing such a pattern can be challenging.,false
38,Client,"Yeah. It's part of my routine, and I don't want to give up something I enjoy. But I also strive to be a good mom, go back to school, and work. How can I do all that without some way to relax?",false
38,Therapist,Changing it seems difficult because it's important for your relaxation right now.,false
38,Client,Yeah.,false
38,Therapist,Yet you value things in life that drinking shouldn't interfere with.,false
38,Client,Yeah.,false
38,Therapist,Have you considered other ways to manage stress without relying on alcohol as much?,false
38,Client,"If I could relieve some of my stress, I might not feel the need to unwind in the same way at night.",false
38,Therapist,So addressing these stressful issues could help. What would that look like for you?,false
38,Client,"Childcare is a big problem. My mom usually watches my son but can't always now, which stresses me out about work and school.",false
38,Therapist,Reliable childcare could make a significant difference.,false
38,Client,"Yeah, definitely.",false
38,Therapist,It seems your mom has been an option before but not as much lately.,false
38,Client,"Yeah. She's probably stressed too, and it shouldn't be her problem since it's not her son. I need something more reliable.",false
38,Therapist,"Finding affordable, dependable childcare could help reduce the urge to drink.",false
38,Client,Yeah.,false
38,Therapist,Anything else?,false
38,Client,"Money is always an issue. If I had more, I could afford daycare and work fewer hours.",false
38,Therapist,"It sounds like money could make a big difference. You're working full-time and going to school for long-term solutions, but you also have other coping ideas. Given our conversation so far, where do you stand?",false
38,Therapist,"We started by discussing how your drinking has reached a risky level, suggesting it would be wise to cut back. It seems important to you not to change this habit right now. However, we've explored ways that might make reducing easier, though I'm unsure if you're ready to pursue them. Where do you feel?",false
38,Client,Yeah. I'm open to considering changing my drinking habits but don't know about actually doing it yet. There are many problems I need to address first.,false
38,Therapist,Perhaps focusing on one issue at a time could help. What would that be for you?,false
38,Client,"Childcare, probably.",false
38,Therapist,"It sounds like childcare is a recurring concern. I can point you toward some resources, but have you explored affordable and reliable options yet?",false
38,Client,"Not really. I usually just ask my mom to watch him, so I haven't looked around much.",false
38,Therapist,You might consider speaking with one of our social workers who specialize in helping people identify necessary resources or alternatives they may not be aware of. Would that interest you?,false
38,Client,"Yeah, definitely.",false
38,Therapist,Great. I can arrange for you to meet with them and address your childcare needs with their help. Is there anything else you'd like to pursue?,false
38,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
38,Therapist,How about setting a goal regarding your drinking habits?,false
38,Client,"Well, I could try reducing it to one drink per night instead of two.",false
38,Therapist,That sounds like a good start—cutting back and seeing how it goes.,false
38,Client,"Yeah. It's uncertain, especially with trying to cut down on smoking too, but I can give it a shot.",false
38,Therapist,Trying this could help you understand the challenge level and explore other stress-coping methods.,false
38,Client,Yeah.,false
38,Therapist,So we have two paths to follow. Anything else?,false
38,Client,I don't think so.,false
38,Therapist,That sounds good. Let's meet again in a couple of weeks to discuss your progress with drinking and meeting with the social worker. Does that work for you?,false
38,Client,Yeah.,false
38,Therapist,"Great, I look forward to our next conversation.",false
38,Client,"Okay, thanks.",false
41,Therapist,I appreciate your presence today.,false
41,Client,Yes.,false
41,Therapist,How are you feeling at this moment?,false
41,Client,"Actually, I'm feeling great.",false
41,Therapist,That's wonderful to hear.,false
41,Client,Yeah.,false
41,Therapist,"Wonderful. So, you've completed the clarifications and value clarifications—",false
41,Client,Yes.,false
41,Therapist,—and what emerged as your top five values?,false
41,Client,"It was a meaningful experience for me; it felt different from anything I've done before. There were several aspects that stood out. The most notable value I identified was self-respect, which surprisingly hasn't been in my top five, let alone at the top.",false
41,Therapist,That's quite interesting.,false
41,Client,"Yes, and—",false
41,Therapist,Do you have any thoughts on why this might be?,false
41,Client,"I do have some ideas. Recently, a few things happened that brought something to my attention during a visit with my family—I've always prioritized others over myself throughout my life, almost never considering my own needs. Realizing this was somewhat sad at the time, but it's also empowering because change is possible at any stage in life.",false
41,Therapist,Absolutely true.,false
41,Client,"Exactly. I believe that by respecting and valuing myself as much as I do others, I can become a better person for everyone around me.",false
41,Therapist,"So, by not consistently putting yourself last?",false
41,Client,Yes.,false
41,Therapist,That makes sense.,false
41,Client,"Because when I neglect myself, I end up feeling stressed, resentful, and overwhelmed—out of balance in a way—and that prevents me from being the best version of myself.",false
41,Therapist,Understood.,false
41,Client,And it affects my ability to be there for others as well.,false
41,Therapist,For someone else?,false
41,Client,"Yes, whether for myself or for someone else.",false
41,Therapist,"Do you feel that by consistently putting yourself last, you were neglecting your own needs, or was it more about prioritizing others so much that you didn't even consider yourself?",false
41,Client,"It's almost like some people might not think I prioritize myself at all, but in my mind and emotions, I've been overly concerned with what others think. This concern has dictated my actions rather than my own values, leading me to do things based on what I thought others wanted from me.",false
41,Therapist,That's quite profound.,false
41,Client,And this pattern has been ingrained since childhood; it was so habitual that I wasn't even aware of it.,false
41,Therapist,It seems like a significant part of your worldview.,false
41,Client,"Yes, absolutely.",false
41,Therapist,"So, do you think there were times when you weren't even conscious of this behavior?",false
41,Client,"Not at all. I was completely unaware. To me, realizing this feels like a celebration. I used to complain about my childhood and the things I missed out on, but now I see that I can be my own parent, giving myself what wasn't given to me before—like having a voice and an opinion.",false
41,Therapist,That's powerful.,false
41,Client,"Yes, and it's the first time in my life I haven't felt guilty about saying this.",false
41,Therapist,The very first time you remember?,false
41,Client,I believe so. I'm not sure if I've ever expressed this without feeling a twinge of guilt before. [chuckles],false
41,Therapist,It's not selfish to prioritize yourself.,false
41,Client,No—,false
41,Therapist,"Exactly, it's not.",false
41,Client,—it really isn't.,false
41,Therapist,That's wonderful to hear.,false
41,Client,Yes.,false
41,Therapist,"So, you've experienced this change and how does that make you feel?",false
41,Client,"It makes me jubilant, joyful, hopeful—it feels like I matter now. I can pursue what I want with more joy and passion, rather than dread or a sense of obligation. Over time, I lost the joy in things I love, like teaching or counseling, because they became obligations instead of passions.",false
41,Therapist,Because you felt so obligated?,false
41,Client,"Yes, it turned into an obligation, and my passion disappeared. Now that I've reconnected with myself, it's as if I was lost for a while but have now found my way back. I remember why these things are important to me because they align with my values.",false
41,Therapist,Is inner harmony also on your top five?,false
41,Client,"No, but the other ones include inner harmony at number two, for similar reasons—I need to be harmonious within myself before I can achieve harmony with others.",false
41,Therapist,So you find peace within yourself?,false
41,Client,"Yes. Family happiness is next because when I'm at peace with myself, it naturally contributes to my family's happiness. When I'm unhappy with myself, I bring that unhappiness into my family life.",false
41,Therapist,That makes sense.,false
41,Client,"Exactly. If I lack self-respect and only consider my family's opinions on who I am or what I should do, I end up resenting them.",false
41,Therapist,You feel resentful then?,false
41,Client,"Yes, when I'm in that mindset. But if I acknowledge myself as an equal member of the family deserving time and attention, it changes everything for me.",false
41,Therapist,And health and achievement are also on your list?,false
41,Client,"Yes, achievement means a sense of accomplishment to me—it ties back to our earlier discussion about being able to show up in my roles with authenticity. I could be a teacher or counselor in many ways, but if I'm not genuine, it doesn't feel fulfilling.",false
41,Therapist,You don't feel fulfilled then?,false
41,Client,"No, just showing up for the paycheck isn't enough. It's about giving something meaningful and real.",false
41,Therapist,So you're looking for meaning in what you do.,false
41,Client,"Exactly, even if it's small.",false
41,Therapist,Sometimes those small things are significant too.,false
41,Client,Yes.,false
41,Therapist,All these changes feel like a healthy shift for you right now.,false
41,Client,"Yes, they really do.",false
41,Therapist,Is there anything else on your list that felt close to the top five?,false
41,Client,"Interestingly, creativity and freedom usually rank high for me but didn't make it into my top five this time—they were in my top 12. I realized that having inner peace and self-respect allows more room for creativity and freedom.",false
41,Therapist,That's insightful.,false
41,Client,"Yes, when I'm scattered and neglect myself, it limits my freedom. Stress stifles my creativity because I can't even hear my own thoughts. Creativity comes from silence and quiet moments; that's where ideas flow easily.",false
41,Therapist,Thank you for sharing these insights with me.,false
41,Client,Thank you for listening.,false
44,Therapist,"Hi, Andrea. Thank you for coming today. I'm here to meet with all students periodically throughout the semester. My role involves discussing your life, goals, and behaviors that might be impacting them.",false
44,Client,Okay.,false
44,Therapist,Could you share a bit about yourself?,false
44,Client,"Sure, my name is Andrea. As you know, I'm in the marching band playing tenor sax. I also participate in music groups like jazz band and wind ensemble.",false
44,Therapist,That's interesting.,false
44,Client,"Yes, and I'm an IB student as well.",false
44,Therapist,How long have you been playing the saxophone?,false
44,Client,"I started about four years ago, but I've been involved with music for around ten years now.",false
44,Therapist,That's quite a commitment. What other instruments did you play before the saxophone?,false
44,Client,I began with the violin and played it for six years. I also tried clarinet and experimented with various instruments until I found my favorite.,false
44,Therapist,It sounds like you've had a rich musical journey. How long have you been in marching band?,false
44,Client,"Since freshman year, so about three years now.",false
44,Therapist,That's great. What do you enjoy most about being in the marching band?,false
44,Client,"The group setting is my favorite part. I love collaborating with classmates and putting on an entire show, especially during competitions—it’s very exciting.",false
44,Therapist,It sounds like a rewarding experience. Do you have friends both within and outside of the band?,false
44,Client,"Yes, I have two groups—friends from class and those from the band.",false
44,Therapist,That's wonderful. Could you tell me a bit about your family?,false
44,Client,"I have an older brother who is nine years my senior, along with my parents and our dog.",false
44,Therapist,What kind of dog do you have?,false
44,Client,He’s a golden retriever named Charlie.,false
44,Therapist,How long have you had him?,false
44,Client,About eight years now.,false
44,Therapist,That's lovely. Do you have any plans for after high school?,false
44,Client,"I'm planning to attend college with the goal of becoming a doctor, possibly in psychology or psychiatry.",false
44,Therapist,Those are ambitious goals. Have you started considering specific schools or majors?,false
44,Client,"Psychology is my intended major, but I haven't decided on which school yet—everyone seems to aim for the Ivy League!",false
44,Therapist,How about your academic performance so far?,false
44,Client,My grades are pretty good; they're in the high threes.,false
44,Therapist,That's impressive. What do you enjoy doing on weekends?,false
44,Client,"Usually, I hang out with friends at someone’s house or go to the movies.",false
44,Therapist,Do alcohol and parties ever come into play during these gatherings?,false
44,Client,"Sometimes, honestly. It depends on my school workload—when there isn't much, it might be every other weekend or three times a month.",false
44,Therapist,So you drink quite frequently then?,false
44,Client,"A little bit, yes.",false
44,Therapist,And how much do you typically consume when you do drink?,false
44,Client,We don’t usually get blackout drunk. It's more about being slightly tipsy. I've had one blackout experience before and learned my lesson from it.,false
44,Therapist,That sounds like a significant amount. What’s the most drinks you’ve ever had in one sitting?,false
44,Client,"The first time, it was around three or four cups with mixed drinks.",false
44,Therapist,And do your friends also drink?,false
44,Client,"Yes, some of them do. We usually have about one cup now after that initial experience.",false
44,Therapist,"It seems like a substantial amount for one serving. Your drinking level is considered high-risk, which can lead to various negative consequences. Does this surprise you?",false
44,Client,"A little bit. Since we're all friends and often sleep over at each other's houses, issues like driving under the influence or assaults don't seem likely.",false
44,Therapist,"It’s good that those risks are minimized, but your drinking level is still concerning. Let's discuss how you might make some changes to reduce this risk.",false
44,Client,I understand. I think I could quit drinking since it doesn’t really serve a purpose for me anymore.,false
44,Therapist,Do you plan to stop drinking entirely?,false
44,Client,"I’d start by telling my friends that I won't be drinking and see how that goes, though it might be challenging with peer pressure.",false
44,Therapist,How do you think you can quit without feeling judged by your friends?,false
44,Client,"My closer friends would understand, but those I'm not as close to might give me a hard time.",false
44,Therapist,"It sounds like distancing yourself from less supportive friends could be beneficial. Let's set a goal for you to stop drinking, ideally starting this weekend.",false
44,Client,That seems doable if we make a solid plan.,false
44,Therapist,The plan is to quit and avoid spending time with friends who aren’t supportive of your decision. How does that sound?,false
44,Client,I think I can manage that.,false
44,Therapist,"Focusing more on band activities might help, especially since you mentioned your class friends are the ones who drink more often. Have you considered how drinking could affect your future plans for medical school?",false
44,Client,"Not really, but it makes sense that it would be a problem.",false
44,Therapist,"Quitting now will definitely support your academic and career goals. It seems manageable, especially since you have other supportive friends. Do you have any questions about this plan?",false
44,Client,How should I respond if my friends ask why I'm not drinking when we hang out?,false
44,Therapist,"You could explain the negative impacts of alcohol on your schoolwork and health, emphasizing that you don’t want to risk becoming an alcoholic or damaging your future.",false
44,Client,That makes sense. I can also mention how it might affect their social media presence negatively if they act irresponsibly while drunk.,false
44,Therapist,"Exactly. Sharing these concerns with your friends could help them understand why you're making this change, and it might even encourage them to reconsider their own drinking habits.",false
44,Client,I think that approach will work for me.,false
44,Therapist,Great. Do you have any other questions or need further assistance?,false
44,Client,"No, I think I'm good for now.",false
44,Therapist,Perfect. Let's plan to meet again in a couple of weeks to check on your progress with quitting drinking.,false
44,Client,Sounds good.,false
44,Therapist,Excellent. See you then!,false
56,Therapist,"Hello, Mrs. Smith. I'm Denise, the social worker here at the clinic working alongside Dr. Fields and our team. I understand you were scheduled to see Dr. Fields today, and I wanted to let you know that my role often involves supporting individuals in situations similar to yours who have returned home from rehab. If it's alright with you, I'd like to learn a bit about how things have been since your return.",false
56,Client,It’s going pretty well.,false
56,Therapist,That sounds positive. What aspects are you particularly glad about?,false
56,Client,"I'm happy to be back at my place. Seeing my dog again is wonderful; he's adorable, and just being home feels comforting.",false
56,Therapist,"It must be heartwarming to see your dog and enjoy the familiarity of home. Your garden seems to be thriving too, and it sounds like you have a supportive neighborhood as well.",false
56,Client,"Yes, everything’s good at home.",false
56,Therapist,I understand that returning home was an important goal for you. It's great to hear you're enjoying aspects of your life there. How are things going with the physical therapy and Tai Chi classes?,false
56,Client,"Actually, I missed both this week.",false
56,Therapist,Is something specific preventing you from attending? You seem a bit down today.,false
56,Client,"Well, I had a minor fall recently—not a complete tumble, but it was enough to remind me that my balance isn’t quite there yet. I hoped the physical therapy and Tai Chi would improve it more than they have so far. Maybe I'm pushing myself too hard and should ease up a bit.",false
56,Therapist,"It sounds like you've been putting in a lot of effort throughout this entire process, working diligently to get home and continuing with your therapies and household responsibilities.",false
56,Client,"Yes, that's true.",false
56,Therapist,"And after this recent incident, it seems you're questioning whether you might have pushed yourself too hard?",false
56,Client,Exactly. I'm considering if I should even continue with Tai Chi because it feels quite demanding.,false
56,Therapist,It does sound like a significant commitment.,false
56,Client,"It’s beautiful and all, but—",false
56,Therapist,What concerns are on your mind regarding this?,false
56,Client,"My main worry is falling again and getting seriously hurt. If I limit my movements, there's less risk of that happening.",false
56,Therapist,So avoiding injury is important to you.,false
56,Client,"Absolutely. Although I didn't get hurt in the fall, it was quite scary and felt like a warning sign that maybe I'm overdoing it.",false
56,Therapist,That makes sense. What do you think might happen if you were to get injured?,false
56,Client,"If I lose my balance again and fall badly, I could be seriously hurt and unable to stay at home. Staying here is very important to me, so I want to do whatever necessary to ensure that.",false
56,Therapist,It seems like the safest option for you right now feels like minimizing activity to avoid any risk of falling.,false
56,Client,"Yes, [laughs] exactly. Maybe just watching TV and spending time with my dog—though not quite to that extreme—but perhaps I was pushing myself too hard.",false
56,Therapist,That sounds like a reasonable approach.,false
56,Client,"I'm reconsidering Tai Chi now. Physical therapy seems beneficial, but Tai Chi is making me question its value for me.",false
56,Therapist,"It's understandable that you're seeing the benefits of physical therapy in building your strength, which might have helped prevent a more serious fall this time.",false
56,Client,"Yes, exactly.",false
56,Therapist,Do you recall what Dr. Fields mentioned about Tai Chi and its role in preventing falls?,false
56,Client,She did mention it. She talked about studies showing its preventative benefits and was quite enthusiastic about it herself.,false
56,Therapist,"I see. It sounds like there's a bit of disappointment that despite your efforts with Tai Chi, the fall still occurred.",false
56,Client,"""Betrayed"" might be strong, but yes, somewhat. My friend loves Tai Chi, so maybe it just isn't for me.",false
56,Therapist,"That makes sense. Ultimately, it’s about finding what works best for you to ensure your safety. Dr. Fields and I are here to help develop a plan that keeps you safe at home.",false
56,Client,"Yes, because the thought of falling alone is frightening. What if no one finds me?",false
56,Therapist,"That's a valid concern, especially since you're living alone.",false
56,Client,"Exactly. So what can be done? I've heard about emergency cords in residences, but how would someone reach them if they fell?",false
56,Therapist,There are devices known as lifelines that people wear around their necks. They’re connected to an alert system so you can call for help when needed.,false
56,Client,I think I’ve seen those on TV. Do they really work?,false
56,Therapist,"Yes, they do. Many of the individuals I've worked with have found them very helpful and reassuring.",false
56,Client,That's good to know. Feeling a bit scared about falling alone makes me realize it’s time for some changes.,false
56,Therapist,"Absolutely. You don't want to return to the hospital, right? We'll work together to keep you safe at home as long as possible.",false
56,Client,"Yes, I'd like that.",false
56,Therapist,What do you think would help you feel safer at home?,false
56,Client,"Perhaps a refresher on safety measures in my house. They showed me some things when I first came back, but maybe another session could help. Also, having some support or reminders might be beneficial—I've been feeling a bit like two steps forward and three steps back.",false
56,Therapist,It sounds like you're looking for more support and connection to help maintain your safety and well-being.,false
56,Client,"Yes, my daughter calls regularly, but she lives far away in Seattle. I don't want to impose on neighbors or friends either.",false
56,Therapist,So additional support and connections would be helpful for you?,false
56,Client,Definitely.,false
56,Therapist,"We can arrange case management services here. They could visit your home, review safety measures with you, and help connect you with other resources.",false
56,Client,That sounds good. Do you think I should try Tai Chi again?,false
56,Therapist,"Considering the support available at the senior center where you were active before, it might be beneficial not just for exercise but also for social support.",false
56,Client,"Maybe I've been too extreme in my approach. [chuckles] So, keep moving?",false
56,Therapist,"It may seem counterintuitive when you're feeling unsafe inside, but staying active actually reduces the risk of falls and increases your safety.",false
56,Client,Really? That's reassuring to hear.,false
56,Therapist,"Yes, it can't prevent all incidents, but it significantly lowers the chances. Are you willing to give it another try?",false
56,Client,I am. It’s just a bit scary.,false
56,Therapist,"It takes courage to face those fears, and your motivation to stay in your home with your dog and garden is strong enough to help you push through them.",false
56,Client,"Yes, I feel committed to staying here, and having some support helps.",false
56,Therapist,That's great. We can continue discussing this at our next session to ensure everything is set up for your safety.,false
56,Client,So the caseworker will come by to refresh my memory on safety measures?,false
56,Therapist,"Absolutely, we'll arrange that for you.",false
56,Client,Knowing I have a way to communicate if something happens eases my biggest fear of being unable to reach out.,false
56,Therapist,That's an important step. We’ll make sure these plans are in place and follow up with you soon.,false
56,Client,Thank you. I'm glad we talked about this today.,false
56,Therapist,I’m glad too. It’s crucial for us to work together on making you feel safer at home. I hope you leave here feeling more secure today.,false
56,Client,"Yes, knowing the caseworker will visit is reassuring.",false
56,Therapist,We'll ensure everything gets set up properly. Thanks for sharing your concerns with me today.,false
53,Therapist,"Hi, Laura. Thank you for coming today. I'm curious about how much you know regarding our purpose here and what we'll discuss. Generally, I meet with students once or twice a semester to talk about various aspects of your life. We'll explore your goals, interests, and behaviors in an informal setting—just an opportunity for me to get to know you better if that's okay.",false
53,Client,Okay.,false
53,Therapist,How about we start by having you share a bit about yourself?,false
53,Client,Sure. My name is Laura; I'm 17 years old and a senior in high school.,false
53,Therapist,"Great, thanks for sharing. What activities do you enjoy during your free time?",false
53,Client,Mostly hanging out with my friends on weekends—things like that.,false
53,Therapist,"That sounds nice. When you're with your friends, what kinds of things do you usually do? Do you attend football games or parties?",false
53,Client,"Yeah, if it's school-related, maybe a game or two, shopping at the mall, going to movies, and sometimes attending parties in the evening.",false
53,Therapist,Got it. What about hobbies—do you have any particular ones?,false
53,Client,"I enjoy reading and spending time outdoors, like taking walks or hiking. I'm quite fond of being outside.",false
53,Therapist,"That's wonderful. So, what are your plans after high school?",false
53,Client,I plan to apply to college with the hope of building a successful career.,false
53,Therapist,That sounds exciting. What field do you think you'll pursue in college?,false
53,Client,"I'm considering journalism or pre-law, though it might be quite different from each other.",false
53,Therapist,Interesting choices! Those are excellent goals to have.,false
53,Client,Thanks!,false
53,Therapist,Pursuing law school is challenging work. How are your grades? What kind of marks do you usually get?,false
53,Client,"I'm doing okay—mostly A's and B's, so I think I'm managing well.",false
53,Therapist,That's good to hear. Are there any subjects where you're not getting A's or B's?,false
53,Client,Not really; all my grades are either A's or B's.,false
53,Therapist,Okay. Have you thought about which colleges you might apply to?,false
53,Client,"I'm still exploring options, possibly local schools, though I haven't decided yet if I'll stay in the area or move away.",false
53,Therapist,That sounds like a plan. What inspired your interest in law school or journalism?,false
53,Client,"Well, since math and science aren't my strengths, I started looking into careers that might suit me better.",false
53,Therapist,"It's great to see you aligning your interests with potential career paths. You mentioned enjoying time with friends—hanging out, shopping, and attending parties. Do you drink alcohol when you're at these gatherings?",false
53,Client,Not really; maybe one or two drinks at a party if I'm there.,false
53,Therapist,How often would that be?,false
53,Client,Probably once or twice a month at most.,false
53,Therapist,"So, about 20 times a year then?",false
53,Client,"Possibly, yes.",false
53,Therapist,That's quite frequent. What do you think is the maximum number of drinks you've had in one sitting?,false
53,Client,Just two drinks at a party; I don't enjoy drinking much. It's more to avoid peer pressure than anything else—I usually just hold a drink without actually consuming it.,false
53,Therapist,"So, have you ever been drunk before?",false
53,Client,"Not really, maybe tipsy but not fully intoxicated.",false
53,Therapist,Understood. The most drinks you've had in one day is two then?,false
53,Client,Yes.,false
53,Therapist,Interesting. Are you aware of the negative effects of alcohol?,false
53,Client,"Yes, I am.",false
53,Therapist,"It's crucial for teenagers to understand the risks associated with drinking and driving—it's a significant issue even here, leading to tragic accidents. Have you ever driven after drinking or been in a car with someone who had?",false
53,Client,"No, I've never drunk-driven nor ridden with a drunk driver.",false
53,Therapist,That's very responsible of you. How much do your friends typically drink?,false
53,Client,Some drink more than others; my closest friends don't drink as much because it doesn't interest me either.,false
53,Therapist,"At the parties you attend, are there kids who consume alcohol heavily?",false
53,Client,"Yes, definitely. There are people who drink a lot more than I do.",false
53,Therapist,Do you spend time with them often?,false
53,Client,Not closely—I know them but don’t consider them close friends.,false
53,Therapist,Being around those who drink heavily can increase your risk of harm. Are you aware of that?,false
53,Client,"Yes, it makes sense.",false
53,Therapist,"Besides driving accidents, there are other dangers like physical injuries or even sexual assault risks, especially for young women when alcohol is involved. Have you considered these risks?",false
53,Client,Absolutely; it's one reason I limit my drinking.,false
53,Therapist,"People also tend to get into fights more often after drinking. Additionally, incidents involving underage drinking can lead to trouble if pictures are shared online, affecting college opportunities due to strict policies on drugs and alcohol. Have you thought about how that might impact your future?",false
53,Client,"Yes, definitely; it's something I'm aware of.",false
53,Therapist,"Yet, you still choose to drink occasionally.",false
53,Client,"It seems like a common thing at parties, so—",false
53,Therapist,Do you think drinking aligns with your aspirations of becoming an attorney?,false
53,Client,Definitely not. That’s why I try to limit my intake.,false
53,Therapist,Understood. Let's discuss some goals for staying safe and healthy.,false
53,Client,Sure.,false
53,Therapist,"Clearly, avoiding alcohol altogether is the safest choice. What are your thoughts on that?",false
53,Client,"I agree; there are health risks involved with drinking, as you mentioned.",false
53,Therapist,Do you think you can stop drinking entirely?,false
53,Client,"Yes, it's not a significant part of my life anyway.",false
53,Therapist,"That’s great to hear. So, we'll note your decision to quit alcohol as a goal for our sessions.",false
53,Client,Okay.,false
53,Therapist,This is why we're here—to support that decision and ensure you feel confident about it. Can you commit to quitting this weekend?,false
53,Client,"Yes, I can definitely do that.",false
53,Therapist,And what about your friends who continue drinking?,false
53,Client,"I can't control their choices, but I'll encourage my closest friends to stop like me.",false
53,Therapist,What if they don’t agree?,false
53,Client,Then I might spend less time with them and find activities that don’t involve alcohol.,false
53,Therapist,"It might be beneficial to seek out new friendships if your current ones continue drinking. They could pressure you into drinking, which would make things awkward for you.",false
53,Client,"Okay, that makes sense.",false
53,Therapist,"Staying away from alcohol will also help you maintain good grades in college, especially since law school requires strong academic performance.",false
53,Client,"Absolutely, I understand the importance of that.",false
53,Therapist,"Well, we've covered most of what needed to be discussed. One thing left is how your parents would react if they found out about your drinking.",false
53,Client,They'd be upset; they don't support alcohol use at all.,false
53,Therapist,That's another reason why quitting might be best for you. I'll see you again next semester to check in on your progress and ensure you're avoiding situations involving alcohol.,false
53,Client,"Okay, sounds good.",false
53,Therapist,Is there anything else you'd like to discuss today?,false
53,Client,"No, I think that covers everything.",false
53,Therapist,Any questions or concerns before we wrap up?,false
53,Client,"No, I don't have any questions.",false
53,Therapist,Alright. That concludes our session for now. You can return to class and thank you again for coming in.,false
53,Client,"Okay, thanks.",false
50,Client,"So, um, it seems like my doctor is concerned about my blood pressure being a bit high, but I don't really see an issue. You know, I maintain a healthy diet. And she suggested watching my caffeine intake, but honestly, caffeine hasn’t been a problem for me.",false
50,Therapist,"Okay. Earlier in our conversation, you mentioned feeling that it might contribute to some agitation. It seems there's a bit of uncertainty here. Are you experiencing any agitation from coffee, or do you feel it’s not an issue at all?",false
50,Client,"Well, sometimes it makes me jittery and I need to use the bathroom more often than my colleagues. Working in the hospital isn't ideal for frequent bathroom breaks. But it keeps me alert and helps me perform better at work. So, I don’t see it as a real problem.",false
50,Therapist,"Yes, I understand.",false
50,Client,"Um, you know, maybe my blood pressure is slightly elevated, but—",false
50,Therapist,"Right. Let’s summarize what we’ve discussed. You experience increased awareness and feel more focused, which are positives. However, there are some negatives with your colleagues' perceptions and possibly your supervisor's view of frequent bathroom breaks.",false
50,Client,Right.,false
50,Therapist,And then there's the blood pressure concern. Does that capture it accurately?,false
50,Client,"Yes, yes. Sometimes it does make me jittery, and I’m not as relaxed as usual. But I enjoy coffee because it enhances my awareness and observation skills at work.",false
50,Therapist,How do you feel about your current caffeine intake? Do you think four cups a day is appropriate for you?,false
50,Client,"Yeah, I have about four cups daily. It’s the night shift workers who bring in a carafe that make me wonder how their bodies cope with so much coffee.",false
50,Therapist,What if we considered reducing your intake slightly to see if it alleviates some of these issues? How does that sound?,false
50,Client,"Reducing it, like—how much are you suggesting?",false
50,Therapist,I’m not sure. You’re currently having four cups a day. What do you think might be reasonable for you?,false
50,Client,"Yeah, but I really need my morning cup. It’s part of my daily ritual and I love the taste.",false
50,Therapist,I understand that it's an important part of your routine.,false
50,Client,Uh—,false
50,Therapist,So keeping that first cup is essential for you.,false
50,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
50,Therapist,"And during a 12-hour shift, having coffee in the afternoon to stay alert until evening seems beneficial too.",false
50,Therapist,I think it’s great that you’ve identified one of your four cups as something you might be willing to adjust. What do you think about trying this change for a while?,false
50,Client,That sounds reasonable.,false
50,Therapist,Good.,false
50,Client,"Yes, I believe I could manage that.",false
68,Therapist,"Hi, Andrea. Thank you for joining me today.",false
68,Client,Hi. Thank you.,false
68,Therapist,I'm curious if you're familiar with my role here and why we're meeting. Let me share a bit about myself first.,false
68,Client,Okay.,false
68,Therapist,"My job involves meeting with students periodically to discuss how things are going, behaviors they might be engaging in, and any changes they may wish to make. It's not my place to change you; rather, I'm here to help you reflect on your current situation and consider potential changes or progress.",false
68,Client,Okay.,false
68,Therapist,Does that sound alright?,false
68,Client,Yeah.,false
68,Therapist,Great. Could we start by having you tell me a bit about yourself?,false
68,Client,"Sure. As you know, my name is Andrea. I'm a junior in the marching band where I play the tenor sax.",false
68,Therapist,That's interesting!,false
68,Client,"Yes, I'm quite involved in music—I also participate in the wind ensemble and jazz band.",false
68,Therapist,It sounds like you're deeply engaged with music.,false
68,Client,Yeah.,false
68,Therapist,When did you start playing?,false
68,Client,"About 10 years ago. I began on the violin, then tried piano and clarinet before settling on the tenor sax.",false
68,Therapist,"That's fascinating! So, besides band, do you have any other hobbies or activities you enjoy?",false
68,Client,I like hanging out with friends or going to the beach.,false
68,Therapist,Sounds like some everyday fun. Anything else?,false
68,Client,Yeah [laughs].,false
68,Therapist,Could you tell me a bit about your family?,false
68,Client,"Sure. I have an older brother, my parents, and we also have a dog—a Golden Retriever.",false
68,Therapist,That's adorable! How are things going in school for you?,false
68,Client,They're pretty good; my grades hover around 3.7.,false
68,Therapist,That's impressive. What goals do you have after high school?,false
68,Client,"I hope to graduate and attend an Ivy League school, though it might not happen. Then, I'd like to study psychology and become a psychiatrist or similar.",false
68,Therapist,Those are some ambitious dreams!,false
68,Client,Yeah.,false
68,Therapist,"It's exciting to think about your future goals. Let’s talk about what matters most in your life. Here’s a list of values—like community, family, respect—that might resonate with you. Which ones do you find most important?",false
68,Client,"I value community and belonging, along with respect.",false
68,Therapist,Could you elaborate on why these are significant to you?,false
68,Client,"Being part of the marching band gives me that sense of community and belonging. As for respect, it's a core principle for me—I believe in respecting myself and others.",false
68,Therapist,"So being part of a group provides you with purpose and belonging, while respect is about valuing yourself and those around you?",false
68,Client,"Yes, exactly.",false
68,Therapist,Let’s explore how these values play out when you're with friends. What do you usually do together?,false
68,Client,"We might go to the movies or the beach, or just hang out at someone's house playing board games.",false
68,Therapist,Is alcohol ever involved in your gatherings?,false
68,Client,"Sometimes, especially at parties.",false
68,Therapist,How does alcohol fit into these social settings for you?,false
68,Client,"It’s mainly used to get things started and loosen up at parties. On non-party nights, we just relax more.",false
68,Therapist,So it seems like the presence of alcohol depends on the activity. Do you notice a difference in your enjoyment between partying and quieter evenings?,false
68,Client,"Definitely. Parties are energetic but draining, while board game nights are relaxing.",false
68,Therapist,What do you enjoy about drinking at parties?,false
68,Client,It helps us relax and have fun without worrying about stress. But too much can lead to problems.,false
68,Therapist,Can you share some of the downsides of alcohol for you?,false
68,Client,"People sometimes make poor decisions when they drink too much, though we try to stay safe by staying in with friends.",false
68,Therapist,So you’re careful not to engage in dangerous activities. But are there still occasional issues?,false
68,Client,"Yes, like dealing with a friend who drinks too much and feels sick afterward.",false
68,Therapist,That sounds challenging. What other negative aspects of alcohol do you notice?,false
68,Client,People can become overly relaxed and act inappropriately.,false
68,Therapist,It seems like you've made some decisions to limit the risks associated with drinking. Why did you choose to do that?,false
68,Client,"I have an aunt who struggles with alcoholism, so I'm aware of its dangers. I want to enjoy myself safely.",false
68,Therapist,That aligns with your value of respecting yourself. How does drinking fit into this respect for yourself?,false
68,Client,"Drinking can be disrespectful to my body, but by controlling how much I drink and staying in safe environments, I try to maintain that respect.",false
68,Therapist,So you're seeking a balance between enjoying the benefits of alcohol without crossing certain lines. What strategies have you used so far?,false
68,Client,I make my own drinks to control the amount I consume and avoid peer pressure by sticking to one drink.,false
68,Therapist,How effective is this strategy for you?,false
68,Client,"It works most of the time, but sometimes social situations lead me to drink more than intended.",false
68,Therapist,So there are times when it's successful and others where adjustments might be needed. How important is it for you to align your drinking habits with your values and goals?,false
68,Client,"I'd rate it a six or seven. It’s important, especially considering my future plans in med school.",false
68,Therapist,"If you decided to cut back on drinking, how confident are you that you could do it?",false
68,Client,A ten—I know I can make the decision and follow through if I choose to.,false
68,Therapist,Have you thought about ways to reduce your alcohol consumption?,false
68,Client,I'm considering suggesting non-alcoholic activities with friends or simply opting out of drinking myself.,false
68,Therapist,"So, planning more alcohol-free activities and participating in them without drinking. Does this sound like a goal you want to pursue now?",false
68,Client,"Yes, it seems very achievable.",false
68,Therapist,Let's plan to meet again in a few weeks to see how things are going. How does that sound?,false
68,Client,That sounds good.,false
68,Therapist,"I appreciate your openness today. You have some great goals ahead, and with your supportive social circle, you're well-positioned to make positive changes for your health and future success.",false
68,Client,"Yeah, I'd like to continue working on this.",false
68,Therapist,Great! I'll see you in a few weeks then.,false
68,Client,Perfect. Nice talking to you.,false
68,Therapist,Likewise. See you soon.,false
62,Therapist,What have you been up to today?,false
62,Client,"I'm doing well, thank you.",false
62,Therapist,That's good to hear. Could you share what's happened since our last session?,false
62,Client,"Well, everything seems okay. My caseworker mentioned something about community service that I need to do, but I'm not entirely sure of the details.",false
62,Therapist,"I see. It sounds like there was a brief discussion with your caseworker, but you're still uncertain about some specifics.",false
62,Client,"Yes, she told me I have to complete a certain number of hours, but I wasn't paying full attention at the time.",false
62,Therapist,That makes sense. Could you tell me what you remember from your conversation with your case manager regarding community service? What do you know so far?,false
62,Client,"I understand that it needs to be completed by the end of my probation, but I'm unclear about how many hours are required or whether I need to find a placement myself.",false
62,Therapist,"Got it. So you're aware that it must be done before your probation ends, but some details remain fuzzy for you.",false
62,Client,"Exactly, yes.",false
62,Therapist,"If it's alright with you, I'd like to go over the requirements and clarify any details for you. Would that be okay?",false
62,Client,"Yes, that would be helpful.",false
62,Therapist,"Great! So far, I know you have 25 hours of community service left to complete by the end of your probation. Your case manager can assist in finding a suitable location. Some clients have done their service at food pantries or shelters, and places like the urban ecology center are also great options. Do any of these sound appealing to you?",false
62,Client,"Yes, but do I need to find the community service hours on my own?",false
62,Therapist,You can definitely work with your case manager to explore those options. They can provide suggestions and contact information for potential placements.,false
62,Client,Okay.,false
62,Therapist,"If you're finding it challenging, we can make those calls together or with your case manager.",false
62,Client,Alright.,false
62,Therapist,"I understand you want to complete the hours quickly. In the past, some clients have found it helpful to plan their hours on a calendar, breaking them down into manageable days. Would that approach work for you?",false
62,Client,"Yes, it would help me keep better track of my progress.",false
62,Therapist,"That's great! If you're committed and it's summer break, completing the hours in about a week could be feasible. Do you have any other questions about community service?",false
62,Client,"I think that covers it. I was just concerned about who would arrange it for me, but now I understand I need to do it myself.",false
62,Therapist,"Absolutely, and remember, if you have more questions later on, feel free to reach out to either me or your case manager. We're here to support you.",false
62,Client,Thank you.,false
62,Therapist,You're welcome.,false
65,Client,"Many people have mentioned that if I quit smoking, I might gain weight.",false
65,Therapist,It sounds like there's a concern about potential weight gain after quitting.,false
65,Client,"Food doesn't taste very appealing to me right now, but others say it tastes much better—",false
65,Therapist,—if you stop smoking?,false
65,Client,Exactly. The downside is the possibility of gaining weight.,false
65,Therapist,"And that would mean needing a new wardrobe, which sounds like something you'd want but can't afford at this time.",false
65,Client,"Yes, exactly.",false
65,Therapist,"So it seems like smoking has been an ongoing part of your life for quite some time now, about 18 years. It's become more significant because there are moments when you didn't expect yourself to smoke.",false
65,Client,That's right.,false
65,Therapist,I hear that the thought of stopping brings up concerns about gaining weight and other challenges. What else might be on this list of worries?,false
65,Client,Withdrawal symptoms.,false
65,Therapist,And what do people say about those symptoms?,false
65,Client,"They describe them as awful, along with feeling cranky.",false
65,Therapist,It sounds like you're hoping your friends will understand and support you through this process if you decide to quit.,false
65,Client,"Yes, I really hope they'll be supportive.",false
65,Therapist,"So, in addition to weight gain, there's the challenge of dealing with withdrawal symptoms. What else might feel difficult about quitting?",false
65,Client,"It seems like everything about smoking is negative now, but after all these years, it's hard to imagine—",false
65,Therapist,—living without cigarettes?,false
65,Client,"Yes, exactly. I know I need to quit, and even though I'm not experiencing health issues from smoking right now—",false
65,Therapist,That must be reassuring in the short term.,false
65,Client,"It is, but after my doctor explained what could happen in the future this morning—",false
65,Therapist,That sounds like a significant moment for you.,false
65,Client,"Yes, it really made me reconsider everything.",false
71,Therapist,"It sounds like you have a vision of having a partner, a home, a nice car, children, and being a good father. Is that right?",false
71,Client,Yeah.,false
71,Therapist,And so this dream includes all those elements. How does your current situation align with or disrupt this picture?,false
71,Client,I guess it doesn't fit at all.,false
71,Therapist,"Can you tell me more about how it doesn’t fit, Billy?",false
71,Client,"Well, I keep having to come here and go back to court, which really throws things off course.",false
71,Therapist,"So, these legal issues are disrupting your dream. Is that what you're saying?",false
71,Client,"Yeah, they make it a lot harder.",false
71,Therapist,It sounds like this could also complicate maintaining steady employment. Would you agree?,false
71,Client,"Yes, because when applying for jobs, I have to disclose my prison record, which makes things difficult.",false
71,Therapist,We've discussed your interest in working with cars before. What thoughts have crossed your mind about pursuing a job in that field since our last meeting?,false
71,Client,Maybe going back to school or taking some courses at the polytech could help.,false
71,Therapist,So you're considering further education as a way forward? Have you spoken to anyone who might be able to guide you on this path?,false
71,Client,"Yeah, I've talked to some people about it.",false
71,Therapist,And these conversations have led you to think about returning to school for training or qualifications. What specifically interests you about that route?,false
71,Client,I just want to learn more about cars and get a hands-on job.,false
71,Therapist,"If you could choose any car-related work, what would be your ideal role?",false
71,Client,[sighs] Being a mechanic or working on panels—I don't mind as long as it involves cars.,false
71,Therapist,"So, anything related to cars sounds appealing. What steps do you think are necessary to achieve this qualification?",false
71,Client,I guess I need to get the training first and then find a job.,false
71,Therapist,And what kind of training have your friends who've pursued similar paths completed?,false
71,Client,"They went to polytech for about a year, followed by an apprenticeship.",false
71,Therapist,How confident are you in being able to follow a similar path as these friends?,false
71,Client,I think it would be easy. I probably already know most of what they learned.,false
71,Therapist,"If it seems manageable, what's the next step you need to take, Billy?",false
71,Client,"I tried picking up some forms from the polytech, but they were too confusing for me to fill out on my own.",false
71,Therapist,So you went to the polytech and collected these forms. What happened when you asked for help there?,false
71,Client,"They told me to fill them out myself, but I couldn't make sense of what was required.",false
71,Therapist,It sounds like they provided a lot of paperwork without much guidance. Did you get any specific forms?,false
71,Client,"Yes, one for panel work and another for painting cars.",false
71,Therapist,You took these forms home with the intention to fill them out later?,false
71,Client,"Right, I planned to ask Donna for help but never got around to it.",false
71,Therapist,It seems like filling out these forms is a challenge. What part of the process do you find confusing?,false
71,Client,I don't understand what information they want me to provide. Writing isn’t my strong suit.,false
71,Therapist,How have past experiences with writing or filling out forms been for you?,false
71,Client,I generally avoid it because I'm not good at it.,false
71,Therapist,It sounds like writing is something that doesn't come naturally to you. What do you think contributes to this difficulty?,false
71,Client,"My handwriting's messy, so people can’t read it easily.",false
71,Therapist,So your handwriting makes things difficult for others to understand. Do you have any ideas on how you could overcome this challenge with the forms?,false
71,Client,Maybe using a computer would help since I find typing easier than writing by hand.,false
71,Therapist,"What do you think is the next step to get these forms filled out and submitted, Billy?",false
71,Client,I guess I need to ask someone for assistance. It's just embarrassing to ask Donna.,false
71,Therapist,So asking Donna feels uncomfortable because of what she might discover about your struggles?,false
71,Client,"Not exactly that serious, but it’s just awkward since most people can manage on their own.",false
71,Therapist,Who else could you consider reaching out to for help with these forms?,false
71,Client,I don't know anyone else. Maybe you could assist me?,false
71,Therapist,Do you have the forms with you at this moment?,false
71,Client,"No, I left them behind.",false
71,Therapist,It seems like filling out these forms is a barrier to achieving your larger goal of getting into a car-related field and staying away from trouble. We need to find a solution for this obstacle. What do you think you can do about the forms before our next session?,false
71,Client,"Maybe I'll go back to pick them up again, but asking Donna still feels awkward.",false
71,Therapist,It sounds like there's some embarrassment in seeking help from her. How does going back to school or polytech feel as a step towards your dream?,false
71,Client,It would mean making big changes since I'm not used to waking up early and the whole school environment doesn't appeal to me.,false
71,Therapist,"So returning to an educational setting feels like it requires significant adjustments in your current lifestyle. How confident do you feel about managing these changes, especially with writing being a challenge?",false
71,Client,It's definitely a barrier. I just don’t want to deal with it because it seems pointless.,false
71,Therapist,It sounds like we need to explore this further. What specifically makes writing such an obstacle for you?,false
71,Client,I'm not sure what you mean by that.,false
71,Therapist,It appears you're using your difficulty with writing as a reason to avoid certain steps. Where do you stand in terms of your reading and writing skills?,false
71,Client,"They’re okay, but I’m not unintelligent—I can read and write just fine.",false
71,Therapist,"Clearly, you have the capability to read and write. How much does this skill set come into play with the course you're considering?",false
71,Client,"I hope it's minimal, but that’s something I need to find out.",false
71,Therapist,"If you felt more confident in your reading and writing abilities, how would that change things for you?",false
71,Client,"It would make everything a lot easier. I don't like reading books, but practical tasks like filling out forms at the bank are important.",false
71,Therapist,"So while hands-on work is your strength, written materials might pose a challenge. How do you feel about this aspect of the course?",false
71,Client,I hadn’t considered that before—it would be tough if there were extensive manuals to read.,false
71,Therapist,"Before reaching your dream, it seems we need to identify and address some initial steps. What do you think is the very first step?",false
80,Therapist,"Jean, it's wonderful to see you again.",false
80,Client,"Hello, doctor.",false
80,Therapist,What changes have you noticed since our last session a week ago?,false
80,Client,"I followed through with what we discussed. I maintained the journal for a week, noting differences in my smoking habits and being more aware of when I felt the urge to smoke and whether I could resist it. It was manageable, though a bit daunting over the weekend as the cravings persisted.",false
80,Therapist,That sounds like quite an effort on your part.,false
80,Client,"Yes, during the weekdays, I managed to reduce my cigarette intake by two or three per day within just one week.",false
80,Therapist,"Reducing by two or three cigarettes is impressive, especially considering how much you used to smoke. You've been keeping up with the journal as well?",false
80,Client,"Yes, I have.",false
80,Therapist,It seems like maintaining the journal helped you focus on delaying your smoking urges effectively. What challenges are still present for you?,false
80,Client,The cravings intensified over the weekend when I was out with friends and spent more time at home rather than work. It became quite difficult to resist those urges then.,false
80,Therapist,"So, it sounds like socializing and having free time during weekends make it harder to avoid smoking compared to other situations?",false
80,Client,"Yes, but I made sure to record these instances honestly in my journal. I need to be more mindful of the weekends, perhaps by engaging in a hobby or joining a group to keep myself occupied.",false
80,Therapist,It's great that you're already considering ways to stay busy on weekends. Are there any other strategies you've thought about to help manage your cravings?,false
80,Client,"If I can delay my smoking and tell myself not to smoke at home, but maybe allow it when I'm at work or commuting, that might help.",false
80,Therapist,That sounds like a practical approach. You also mentioned wanting to avoid smoking in your house altogether?,false
80,Client,"Yes, exactly. From now until our next meeting, I want to focus on reducing my smoking further and maintaining the journaling practice.",false
80,Therapist,So you plan to continue with the journaling and aim for another reduction in cigarettes?,false
80,Client,"Right. After this first week, I've already cut down by two cigarettes a day. My goal is to reduce it further to five cigarettes daily, which means cutting out three more each day.",false
80,Therapist,You're aiming for five cigarettes per day now. What specific actions do you think will help you achieve that?,false
80,Client,I plan to count my cigarettes every day and continue resisting the urge by waiting until the next craving hits before smoking again.,false
80,Therapist,That sounds like a solid plan. How can we support each other in this process moving forward?,false
80,Client,"Discussing it with you is really helpful, as it gives me someone to talk to about these challenges.",false
80,Therapist,When would be a good time for our next session to review your progress and discuss any new developments?,false
80,Client,"I'd like to come back in another week. This is all quite new to me, and a week feels manageable.",false
80,Therapist,"Absolutely, we can schedule it for a week from now.",false
80,Client,"Thank you, doctor.",false
80,Therapist,You're welcome. See you next week then.,false
80,Client,"Yes, thank you.",false
83,Therapist,"Hello, Rick. Welcome.",false
83,Client,Kia ora.,false
83,Therapist,"I'm glad to see you here today. According to your file, it seems there's something specific we're addressing?",false
83,Client,Yup. That's right.,false
83,Therapist,Could you tell me which part of the country you're from?,false
83,Client,I'm from down south.,false
83,Therapist,"Oh, okay.",false
83,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
83,Therapist,Are you from near the very bottom? Perhaps around Bluff?,false
83,Client,"Yes sir. I'm from Invercargill, just a bit away from Bluff. All my family is still there.",false
83,Therapist,"Oh, they are? So you were born and raised there?",false
83,Client,Mm-hmm. Country boy.,false
83,Therapist,A country boy. How long have you been living in Christchurch?,false
83,Client,I've been here since I was 18.,false
83,Therapist,So you've been here for quite some time now?,false
83,Client,Just a little while. Yeah.,false
83,Therapist,Do you have any family members with you here in Christchurch?,false
83,Client,"Uh, just my own.",false
83,Therapist,Just your immediate family is here then. I'm curious about that because we'll be working together over the coming weeks. What thoughts crossed your mind on your way here today?,false
83,Client,"Um, I was thinking about what questions you might ask and how I should respond. I've been considering my kids and needing to take a day off work.",false
83,Therapist,Right.,false
83,Client,It's a bit of a hassle.,false
83,Therapist,Okay. You seem to have some experience with prevention services before?,false
83,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
83,Therapist,How has that experience been for you in the past?,false
83,Client,"Uh, it's been okay. Um, not bad at all.",false
83,Therapist,Right.,false
83,Client,"I don't know. Kind of nothing, really.",false
83,Therapist,Okay. Is this similar to previous offenses that brought you here again?,false
83,Client,Yeah.,false
83,Therapist,One thing I've learned over the years is that many people hesitate before entering these services and yet you came in today. What does that suggest about your intentions?,false
83,Client,"Um, I hope it shows that I want to make some changes.",false
83,Therapist,Yeah.,false
83,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
83,Therapist,Is this different from when you've come here before?,false
83,Client,Yeah. And I still had to walk through those doors so-,false
83,Therapist,Yeah.,false
83,Client,"-but, um, I just think about my kids, you know.",false
83,Therapist,Yeah. They're really important to you?,false
83,Client,Yeah.,false
83,Therapist,Yeah. Do you have your children with you full-time or-,false
83,Client,"No. No, I don't. I see them once every two weeks.",false
83,Therapist,Okay. How does that feel for you?,false
83,Client,It sucks.,false
83,Therapist,Mm-hmm.,false
83,Client,Yeah.,false
83,Therapist,What would you really like to happen in terms of your relationship with your children?,false
83,Client,"I just-- I'd love to see them whenever I can, whenever I wanted to. You know. They're my whole world and-and I've messed things up.",false
83,Therapist,Right.,false
83,Client,"So, you know.",false
83,Therapist,Coming here to work with me means you'll also be participating in a program. How significant is that for you and your children?,false
83,Client,It's really important.,false
83,Therapist,"Mm-hmm. If I were to rate its importance on a scale from 1 to 100, where 1 is not very important and 100 is extremely important, how would you place it?",false
83,Client,"It's hard because-because I'm, uh, I'm not a bad person. I've just done some stupid things, but I'm not a bad person.",false
83,Therapist,Right.,false
83,Client,"In terms of my kids, I'd be 100-100%.",false
83,Therapist,Right.,false
83,Client,If it means I can see my-- see my kids whenever I- whenever I want.,false
83,Therapist,Yeah. How do you think your children would feel if they heard you say this program is really important to both you and them? That you're giving it your all?,false
83,Client,"Um, I-I-I'd hope that they'd be proud of me. I wouldn't want my kids to see me- to see me here though. But I- But I hope they would be proud of me.",false
83,Therapist,Okay.,false
83,Client,'Cause I'm-- Yeah.,false
83,Therapist,Good. Is there anyone else in your family who would feel proud of you for taking these steps?,false
83,Client,"Um, oh, my mom.",false
83,Therapist,Yeah. Your mom is still down south?,false
83,Client,Yeah.,false
83,Therapist,Does she know that you're here today?,false
83,Client,No.,false
83,Therapist,How do you think it might be for her if she knew you were talking like this today? It seems to me like you're really serious about making changes this time.,false
83,Client,"Yeah, I am.",false
83,Therapist,Yeah.,false
83,Client,"I just, um, I don't- don't know where to s-- where to start. I don't know.",false
83,Therapist,So do you think participating in and completing this program would be a good starting point?,false
83,Client,"Yeah, I hope so. I-- So I genuinely want to help myself. I don't deliberately mess things up for myself.",false
83,Therapist,"Yeah. We'll be doing some work together then. Sometimes it can get quite challenging. Before we proceed further, when the going gets tough, a lot of people decide to leave. Are you someone who might do that?",false
83,Client,"No, this is important to me.",false
83,Therapist,Right.,false
83,Client,"I have, um, I've-- it's important to me.",false
83,Therapist,Good. Another thing we consider is whether this work is done in isolation or with support from others. Who do you think would be supportive of your efforts and whom should you inform about the program?,false
83,Client,I'm separated at the moment from my missus and-,false
83,Therapist,What was-- what was your partner's name?,false
83,Client,"Uh, Kirsty.",false
83,Therapist,Kristy.,false
83,Client,"I would- I would love for her to know that I'm doing this and that I mean it, but, um, I know she wouldn't care right now actually.",false
83,Therapist,Right. Do you think your employer would be supportive?,false
83,Client,"Uh, yeah, I don't know. Maybe, but I don't know if I want them to know though.",false
83,Therapist,Okay. What do you think it might feel like for you to explore that with them?,false
83,Client,"Uh, I don't know.",false
83,Therapist,Are there any other family members nearby who you believe would be supportive?,false
83,Client,I'm pretty much by myself up here.,false
83,Therapist,"Okay. The reason I ask is because being responsible involves attending the program and also identifying people to hold us accountable while we're doing it. So, who else could we involve to support you during this process?",false
83,Client,"Um, I don't know. I don't, um, have that many people-",false
83,Therapist,Okay.,false
83,Client,"-that I am-- I don't have that many people I trust to support me. My mates, I love them but, um, yeah, I don't know.",false
83,Therapist,"Okay. As we work together and go through this program, one of our goals is not to fall into the same patterns as before. So let's think about who else might be supportive that we haven't considered yet. How could you involve your mother and perhaps your partner in this process?",false
83,Client,"Yeah, let's give it some thought.",false
83,Therapist,"Rick, I sense that you're navigating this journey somewhat alone at the moment. Would that be accurate?",false
83,Client,Yeah. That'll definitely be true.,false
83,Therapist,Your family is down south. Who else do you think would genuinely want to support and encourage you on this journey?,false
83,Client,"Uh, I have a good relationship with my mum,-",false
83,Therapist,Okay.,false
83,Client,-with my brothers and sisters.,false
83,Therapist,Yeah.,false
83,Client,My mom is actually pretty important to me.,false
83,Therapist,"Yeah. How do you think your mom would feel if she knew this was something really significant for you, that you're doing it for her and the family?",false
83,Client,I think she'd be proud of me.,false
83,Therapist,Yeah. All right.,false
83,Client,Yeah.,false
83,Therapist,Would your brothers and sisters also be supportive if they were aware of your journey?,false
83,Client,"Yeah. Yeah. A good, uh, good family.",false
83,Therapist,Good. How would you go about getting them involved to support you and hold you accountable during this process?,false
83,Client,"Um, I don't know. Um, have some-somebody just to listen.",false
83,Therapist,And what do you think your mom might want to say if she were here with us now and heard you talking about this?,false
83,Client,She would- she would tell me that she loves me. She would tell me that she believes I can do it.,false
83,Therapist,"Mm. What do you think she'd hope for you, especially regarding your children?",false
83,Client,For them to have a father they can look up to.,false
83,Therapist,I’m getting a strong sense that's what you want as well.,false
83,Client,It is what I want. Definitely.,false
83,Therapist,"So, in terms of having the confidence to do this with the support of your family and ours, where would you place your confidence level now?",false
83,Client,"If I had their support from my-my family and [silence] I want to say that would be higher. I just know I messed it up in the past. If they were there to support me now, then I’d be 99% sure.",false
83,Therapist,"That's a huge move up the scale, isn't it? So getting your family on board and having their support is going to be really important for us.",false
83,Client,Yeah.,false
86,Client,I just feel overwhelmed and powerless about everything that's happening.,false
86,Therapist,It sounds like you're feeling quite hopeless about your current situation.,false
86,Client,Mm. I just feel overwhelmed and powerless about everything that's happening.,false
86,Therapist,You seem uncertain about what steps to take next.,false
86,Client,No one seems interested in helping me.,false
86,Therapist,It feels like people aren't stepping up to offer you the support you need.,false
86,Client,No one seems interested in helping me.,false
86,Therapist,You're feeling quite isolated right now.,false
86,Client,Mm-hmm. I really regret what I've done.,false
86,Therapist,You recognize that it was a mistake on your part.,false
86,Client,Mm-hmm. I really regret what I've done.,false
86,Therapist,It sounds like you're experiencing some regret over your actions.,false
86,Client,Mm-hmm. I just couldn't resist the urge.,false
86,Therapist,It seems like something happened beyond your control.,false
86,Client,I just couldn't resist the urge.,false
86,Therapist,You're concerned about losing control over your behavior.,false
86,Client,"Actually, it's been a fantastic week for me.",false
86,Therapist,It sounds like you've had an exceptionally good week.,false
86,Client,"Actually, it's been a fantastic week for me.",false
86,Therapist,You seem quite enthusiastic about how things have gone this week.,false
86,Client,Mm-hmm. I know who to spend time with; I'm not clueless.,false
86,Therapist,It seems like you're making wise choices regarding your social circle.,false
86,Client,I know who to spend time with; I'm not clueless.,false
86,Therapist,You recognize that being around positive influences has been beneficial for you.,false
86,Client,Mm-hmm. I feel like I'm disappointing my whole family. They had such high expectations of me.,false
86,Therapist,It sounds like you're feeling like a letdown to your family.,false
86,Client,Mm-hmm. I feel like I'm disappointing my whole family. They had such high expectations of me.,false
86,Therapist,You sense that you haven't met their hopes and dreams for you.,false
86,Client,Mm-hmm. This isn't the life I want for myself.,false
86,Therapist,It seems like this doesn't align with your aspirations.,false
86,Client,This isn't the life I want for myself.,false
86,Therapist,You're open to making changes to improve your situation.,false
86,Client,Mm-hmm. I really want to complete the program successfully.,false
86,Therapist,You don't want to remain in this program any longer.,false
86,Client,I really want to complete the program successfully.,false
86,Therapist,It seems like you're committed to adhering to the guidelines here.,false
86,Client,"Mm-hmm. Even though I've quit, I still have cravings for smoking.",false
86,Therapist,You find yourself frequently thinking about it.,false
86,Client,"Even though I've quit, I still have cravings for smoking.",false
86,Therapist,It takes a lot of determination to resist those cravings even now.,false
86,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
98,Therapist,It seems like your second DUI occurred under similar circumstances as the first one. Is that correct?,false
98,Client,"Yes, it was pretty much the same situation.",false
98,Therapist,And these friends have been part of your life since high school?,false
98,Client,"Absolutely, they've been my friends for a long time.",false
98,Therapist,Do you engage in any activities outside of this social drinking circle when you're not with them?,false
98,Client,"I usually do things around the house like yard work. Other than that, not much else comes to mind.",false
98,Therapist,How is your current dating life going? Are there other relationships apart from these friendships?,false
98,Client,I'm single at the moment and just casually date without wanting anything serious right now.,false
98,Therapist,"So, you're quite clear about what a committed relationship looks like for you?",false
98,Client,"Yes, definitely. I don't feel ready to be in a regular, committed relationship.",false
98,Therapist,"It sounds like you have a good understanding of your own needs and preferences. Now, considering this second DUI, if you were to find yourself in a similar situation again, what would you do differently?",false
98,Client,I think I'd try to drink less and make sure to call a taxi or arrange some other way home if I did end up drinking.,false
98,Therapist,Is there someone specific you could call for a ride?,false
98,Client,"Not really. If I were going out to drink, I'd need to plan that in advance.",false
98,Therapist,"So, having the money set aside for a taxi would be part of your plan?",false
98,Client,"Yes, I think keeping some cash specifically for emergencies like this would help me get home safely.",false
98,Therapist,How often do you anticipate needing this plan?,false
98,Client,Probably not too often. I don't see myself as having a drinking problem; it was just an isolated incident.,false
98,Therapist,You mentioned planning to have people over for the Super Bowl. Would they be staying at your place while drinking?,false
98,Client,"Yes, that's right. It's important to have friends over during events like the Super Bowl.",false
98,Therapist,And would you be concerned about them needing a ride home as well?,false
98,Client,"Not really. The people I hang out with don't drink excessively, so they can usually take care of themselves.",false
98,Therapist,So it sounds like your plan involves being cautious and having safety measures in place for yourself while trusting that your friends will manage on their own.,false
98,Client,"Exactly. They're not heavy drinkers, so I think they'll be fine.",false
98,Therapist,How was the experience when you decided to stop drinking for six months?,false
98,Client,"It felt good physically, and I did well at work, but I missed having my friends around, which made it feel isolating.",false
98,Therapist,Six months is quite a long time. Were there other people in your life during that period?,false
98,Client,"My girlfriend and I were trying to make things work, but we ended up arguing a lot.",false
98,Therapist,"If you were to consider not drinking again, do you think there are other friendships or relationships that could fill the social gap left by those who drink?",false
98,Client,"It's hard because most of my friends drink. There might be some acquaintances who don't, but I don't have many close friends like that.",false
98,Therapist,How would maintaining these friendships while not drinking affect your relationship with them?,false
98,Client,It feels uncomfortable. They tend to pressure me into joining in on the drinking until I give in.,false
98,Therapist,So it sounds like they might tease or encourage you to drink until you do?,false
98,Client,"Yes, exactly. It makes me feel like an outsider when I'm not participating.",false
98,Therapist,Friendship is clearly very important to you. How crucial would it be for you to stay friends with them while maintaining your sobriety?,false
98,Client,"If getting my license back is the goal, then it might be necessary to distance myself from them temporarily.",false
98,Therapist,It seems like trying that could be a worthwhile experiment.,false
98,Client,I agree. It's something worth considering.,false
98,Therapist,Would you say this is important enough for you to try?,false
98,Client,"Yes, especially if it helps me get my license back.",false
98,Therapist,That sounds like a positive step forward. Thank you for sharing all of this with me.,false
98,Client,Thanks for listening and helping me think through these things.,false
98,Therapist,You're welcome. I appreciate your openness and willingness to consider different options.,false
95,Therapist,"Hi, Ruth. Thank you for coming today. How are you feeling?",false
95,Client,"Um, okay. I'm just at a loss about why I'm here anymore. I feel so foolish and inadequate. It seems pointless to me; I keep repeating the same harmful patterns even though I know they're dangerous. My willpower is completely gone, ma'am. Yeah, [foreign language].",false
95,Therapist,"Ruth, it sounds like you're feeling very frustrated and exhausted. You've lost your motivation.",false
95,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
95,Therapist,And you don't feel inclined to continue with these patterns?,false
95,Client,"No, cutting seems like the only escape for me. I have suicidal thoughts and [foreign language], and everything feels so overwhelming and depressing at home.",false
95,Therapist,It sounds like you're feeling completely overwhelmed by it all.,false
95,Client,Yeah.,false
95,Therapist,"You're exhausted, stressed, and so sad that you hurt yourself to feel something different from what's inside.",false
95,Client,Yes. Sometimes physical pain helps me cope with the emotional turmoil within me.,false
95,Therapist,So you've been experiencing a lot of inner turmoil?,false
95,Client,Yes. I am.,false
95,Therapist,I'm sorry to hear that. It must be incredibly frustrating to feel so much pain and not know how to address it. It seems like crying is one way you're trying to cope right now.,false
95,Client,"Yeah, yeah, suicide.",false
95,Therapist,"It's okay, Ruth. I understand the depth of your pain.",false
95,Client,[foreign language],false
95,Therapist,"So your mom doesn't fully understand what you're going through, and there isn't a father figure present?",false
95,Client,"Yes, because she's a single mom who struggles a lot. I want to help her, but I can't. It makes me sad to think that if I weren't here, she might be better off without worrying about me or my expenses.",false
95,Therapist,So you feel trapped and like a burden to your mom. She's doing everything as a single parent while dealing with many challenges herself. It seems like you believe you're adding more problems for her.,false
95,Client,Yeah.,false
95,Therapist,"And if you weren't here, it would solve those issues for her?",false
95,Client,I-I think so?,false
95,Therapist,How do you think she'd be better off without you?,false
95,Client,Because I wouldn't be a burden to her anymore.,false
95,Therapist,In what ways do you feel like a burden now?,false
95,Client,"She has to pay for my food, school uniforms, and our home.",false
95,Therapist,And how are you trying to support her at the moment?,false
95,Client,I try to be a good kid. I go to school even if my grades aren't perfect; I'm not failing any classes.,false
95,Therapist,"So by coming here today, Ruth, sharing your feelings with me, and opening up about your struggles, you're taking steps to help yourself. This shows that you care deeply for both yourself and your mom. It seems like you don't want to leave her alone because you're concerned about the burdens she faces without you. That demonstrates how much you care about her. However, it sounds like the immediate solution you have in mind might not be the best choice. How could ending your life be beneficial when you both rely on each other? I understand your pain and where you're coming from. The physical release you feel helps momentarily. Are there other ways we can explore to help replace that behavior?",false
95,Client,"Um, I don't know. It's just, um, I'm not sure if I can.",false
95,Therapist,"You're uncertain about what steps to take next. There's a lot on your mind right now. You've opened up about cutting and having thoughts of self-harm. The cutting provides short-term relief from feeling like a burden to your mom, which adds to your stress and sadness. Despite seeing how much she struggles, we also recognize the effort you're making by attending school regularly and maintaining decent grades, even excelling in math. Your efforts are evident, but it's understandable to feel sometimes that they aren't enough. That's why we're here—to help you express these feelings and find ways to support you.",false
95,Client,"Thank you, ma'am, I feel better.",false
95,Therapist,"Oh, thank you, Ruth. I appreciate your openness today.",false
95,Client,Okay.,false
104,Therapist,"Before we conclude, would it be alright if I review the questionnaire you completed prior to our session?",false
104,Client,Sure.,false
104,Therapist,"Thank you. When discussing alcohol and drugs with patients, my role is to provide information and understand their intentions or desires regarding any changes they might want to make. Does that resonate with you?",false
104,Client,"Yes, it does.",false
104,Therapist,Excellent. You mentioned in your questionnaire that you've consumed alcohol on at least eight occasions over the past year. Is that accurate?,false
104,Client,"Yes, around eight times. I'm not entirely certain.",false
104,Therapist,Understood. Could you describe how you typically drink?,false
104,Client,"Well, I mainly drink when I'm at parties and not at home or anywhere else.",false
104,Therapist,Got it. What types of alcohol do you usually consume at these gatherings?,false
104,Client,"Typically, it's liquor—vodka mixed with other drinks, sometimes beer, though I don't particularly enjoy beer. At parties, the common choices are vodka and orange juice or gin and tonics.",false
104,Therapist,How many drinks would you estimate you have during a party?,false
104,Client,Are you asking about the entire duration of my stay there?,false
104,Therapist,"Yes, exactly.",false
104,Client,Probably around four or five drinks.,false
104,Therapist,You indicated that drinking helps you feel relaxed and fit in. Is that correct?,false
104,Client,"Yes, it definitely makes me feel more at ease.",false
104,Therapist,"Additionally, you mentioned sometimes forgetting things when you drink. Could you elaborate on what you tend to forget?",false
104,Client,"I often lose track of how many drinks I've had or which friend asked me about it. Sometimes, I even forget where I am.",false
104,Therapist,"So, there are moments when you forget your location as well?",false
104,Client,"Yes, that's right.",false
104,Therapist,"Now, let me share some information with you. The safest level of alcohol consumption for teenagers is zero drinks because drinking can negatively impact brain development and increase the risk of accidents, sexual assault, and sexually transmitted diseases among adolescents. I'm curious if you think your drinking might relate to any risks of contracting an STD?",false
104,Client,"Yes, actually. The last time I had sex was while we were both drinking, and we didn't use a condom.",false
104,Therapist,Do you recall giving consent during that encounter?,false
104,Client,"Yes, we've been intimate before with the use of a condom.",false
104,Therapist,How do you think alcohol influenced your decision not to use a condom this time?,false
104,Client,We just didn't take the moment to put one on. Our judgment was impaired.,false
104,Therapist,It sounds like drinking affects your decision-making in those situations?,false
104,Client,"Yes, definitely. If I were sober, I would have insisted on using a condom.",false
104,Therapist,There's another point I'd like to share. Forgetting where you are or how many drinks you've had can indicate heavy drinking. Persisting with alcohol despite negative consequences might suggest an alcohol use disorder.,false
104,Client,"No, that doesn't describe me. I don't think I need any help.",false
104,Therapist,I'm curious about what aspects of drinking you enjoy?,false
104,Client,It's enjoyable when my friends are also drinking. It makes me laugh more and feel like it's just fun.,false
104,Therapist,And what parts of your drinking experience do you find less appealing?,false
104,Client,Forgetting where I am sometimes bothers me.,false
104,Therapist,Is there anything else that concerns you about your drinking habits?,false
104,Client,Definitely not wanting to contract any STDs.,false
104,Therapist,"So, on one hand, you appreciate the relaxation and fun associated with drinking, but on the other, you're concerned about forgetting locations or drink counts and the risk of STDs. Does that sound right?",false
104,Client,"Yes, exactly.",false
104,Therapist,"Considering what you like and dislike about your drinking habits, where would you like to go from here? What changes do you wish to make regarding your alcohol consumption?",false
104,Client,I definitely don't want to overindulge again.,false
104,Therapist,"How prepared are you to avoid excessive drinking? On a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 being completely ready, where would you place yourself?",false
104,Client,I'd say a nine.,false
104,Therapist,"You seem quite determined not to drink excessively. Why do you feel so strongly about choosing a high number like nine instead of something lower, such as six or seven?",false
104,Client,"Well, the thought of getting an STD is really concerning to me, and I don't want to be uncertain about it.",false
104,Therapist,What plan could you devise to ensure you meet this goal?,false
104,Client,"I intend to keep track of my drinks so that I don't exceed two, and I'll stop drinking once I start feeling intoxicated.",false
104,Therapist,That sounds like a solid plan. Is there anyone who might support you in achieving this goal?,false
104,Client,There's a friend who thinks I drink too much. She'd probably help me commit to not having more than two drinks at parties.,false
104,Therapist,"And regarding unprotected sex, it seems important for you to avoid that situation again.",false
104,Client,"Yes, I plan to discuss it with him and ensure we always use a condom and never have sex while drunk.",false
104,Therapist,"So, you're highly motivated to change your drinking habits and have a strategy to limit yourself to two drinks at parties and prevent unprotected sex. How about checking in on how things are going? Would you be open to meeting again in six weeks?",false
104,Client,"Sure, that works for me.",false
104,Therapist,"Great. Thank you for sharing with me today, and I look forward to our next session.",false
113,Therapist,"Hello, Sandra.",false
113,Client,Hi.,false
113,Therapist,"Thank you for taking a moment to meet with me today. I understand your time is limited, and I truly appreciate you making it possible to stop by.",false
113,Client,"Well, I came in because my daughter is also hospitalized. Quitting smoking seems important to me, but I enjoy it too much right now. My life feels chaotic at the moment.",false
113,Therapist,"It sounds like there are several concerns on your mind, and coming here wasn't necessarily your top priority when you visited the hospital with your daughter. What prompted you to make time for this meeting? What were some of your thoughts leading up to it?",false
113,Client,"I believe it's important because I don't want to be a negative role model for my kids. My daughter is turning 12, and some of her friends have already tried smoking. I don't want her to think it's acceptable.",false
113,Therapist,So you wouldn't want your daughter to start smoking.,false
113,Client,"I smoked when I was younger, and I certainly don't want that for her.",false
113,Therapist,"It seems like being a good example is something you're concerned about, but as you mentioned earlier, you're not quite ready to stop smoking right now.",false
113,Client,That's true. It feels overwhelming at the moment. I'm just not prepared to make this change yet.,false
113,Therapist,"Sandra, what do you enjoy about smoking? What are its benefits for you?",false
113,Client,"It's very enjoyable and relaxing; it helps me relieve stress. At work, we all go outside to smoke and chat, so if I stopped, I'd feel left out.",false
113,Therapist,Is there anything else that makes smoking appealing to you?,false
113,Client,"Yes, I like having a cigarette after meals—it signals to my brain that I'm done eating, which helps me control my weight. Sometimes I choose a cigarette over a snack.",false
113,Therapist,Are there any other aspects of smoking that you find beneficial?,false
113,Client,"Let me think... I just enjoy it. I know it's not good for me, but I've been smoking for so long that quitting doesn't cross my mind often.",false
113,Therapist,"To ensure I understand correctly, the benefits of smoking include relaxation, socializing with work friends, and managing your weight. It seems challenging to imagine being at work without this routine. Is there anything else I might have missed?",false
113,Client,Okay.,false
113,Therapist,"So it sounds like smoking helps you relax, connect socially with colleagues, and manage your weight. You're concerned about potential weight gain if you quit and find the habit of smoking after meals hard to give up. It's also deeply ingrained in your life, making it difficult to envision yourself as a non-smoker. Does that capture some of the reasons why you continue to smoke?",false
113,Client,Exactly.,false
113,Therapist,I hear there are aspects of smoking you really enjoy. Can you share any downsides or challenges associated with it?,false
113,Client,"I'm worried about my children, especially feeling like a bad parent. My daughter has seen me smoke for years, and I don't want her to start, especially since some of her friends already do.",false
113,Therapist,"Sandra, can you recall a specific instance where you felt your actions might have influenced your daughter negatively?",false
113,Client,"Yes, this morning when I was outside smoking, she looked out the window at me.",false
113,Therapist,Seeing her watching you like that must have been impactful. How did it feel to realize she's observing and looking up to you?,false
113,Client,"It made me feel terrible. I want to be a good parent, and this doesn't align with my goals.",false
113,Therapist,"Thank you for sharing your thoughts so openly; discussing this is undoubtedly challenging. Smoking is a tough habit to consider quitting. On one hand, being a good role model is crucial to you, yet on the other, smoking provides stress relief and social interaction that you find hard to imagine giving up. How do these conflicting priorities fit together for you?",false
113,Client,They don't really align. It's contradictory—I enjoy it but know it's not right.,false
113,Therapist,What would need to happen for quitting or changing your smoking habits to become a higher priority for you?,false
113,Client,I can't think of anything specific at the moment.,false
113,Therapist,"Understood. So, while you're contemplating change, there aren't concrete plans to quit yet. It's more about figuring out how it could work for you.",false
113,Client,Exactly.,false
113,Therapist,Thank you for your time today. We've likely used up our available time. Would you be open to scheduling another appointment next week to continue this conversation?,false
113,Client,"Oh, sure. I'll come in.",false
113,Therapist,"Great. It's not the most exciting topic, but I appreciate your willingness to discuss it further. Could I ask you to do a small task before our next meeting? We have a booklet for those considering change, and one exercise is to list your top three reasons for wanting to quit smoking. Reflect on both the positive and negative aspects of quitting and continuing to smoke. Would you be willing to try this over the next few days?",false
113,Client,"Okay, I'll give it a try.",false
113,Therapist,Here's the booklet for you.,false
113,Client,Thank you.,false
113,Therapist,"Thanks again for coming in today, Sandra. We'll see you next week.",false
113,Client,All right.,false
116,Therapist,"Molly, thank you so much for joining me today. I appreciate your willingness to talk.",false
116,Client,You're welcome.,false
116,Therapist,"I'm grateful for that. Your mom mentioned there have been some issues at school with other kids being unkind and spreading rumors about you, which must be hurtful.",false
116,Client,"Yes, I've had to stay home from school twice already because of bullying.",false
116,Therapist,That's a significant amount of time away from school. It sounds really challenging for you.,false
116,Client,"And when I was out, more rumors started circulating. When I returned, these rumors were still spreading about me. For instance, there was a rumor that I spent the whole day in the principal’s office with security escorts, which wasn't true because I was home all day.",false
116,Therapist,It seems like people enjoy creating stories without basis.,false
116,Client,"Ever since fifth or sixth grade, it feels like I'm blamed for everything happening around me.",false
116,Therapist,Why do you think that is? What kinds of things lead to this?,false
116,Client,"I believe it's because the kids see me as an easy target. When someone tells me something, I tend to engage more with them rather than letting it go. It seems like they find it easier to blame me and talk about me.",false
116,Therapist,"So when you mentioned engaging more, could you give me a specific example of what that looks like?",false
116,Client,"If someone says, ""I heard this rumor about you,"" I ask for details and keep the conversation going, which sometimes makes things worse. For instance, if they threaten to hit me, I might respond by saying, ""Then go ahead,"" instead of walking away.",false
116,Therapist,What usually happens when you engage in these conversations?,false
116,Client,"The situation escalates because more talking leads to bigger issues. If I stop, it confuses them and the conversation ends. But if I keep talking, things get worse, and we both end up getting into trouble and being called down to the principal's office.",false
116,Therapist,Okay.,false
116,Client,And then we're reprimanded.,false
116,Therapist,What does that experience feel like for you afterward?,false
116,Client,"Usually, I try to remind myself to just walk away. But if someone says something about me, it makes me angry because they’re talking about me. Sometimes, I can't help but say a few words back. Lately, though, I'm trying to improve.",false
116,Therapist,Mm-hmm.,false
116,Client,"There was one time when someone talked to me, and I just said, ""This is really lame; I’m leaving,"" and walked away without engaging further.",false
116,Therapist,That's impressive that you managed to do that. You should feel proud of yourself.,false
116,Client,"Yes, I felt proud for handling it that way.",false
116,Therapist,You have every reason to be proud. How did you manage to do that?,false
116,Client,"I thought about how my mom reacts when I get into these situations. She gets upset and says she won’t help me anymore because she tells me to walk away. So, I tried thinking from her perspective and realized if I said, ""This is lame; leave me alone,"" it would stop the conversation and prevent further trouble.",false
116,Therapist,That shows a lot about your understanding of your mom's feelings and how you can anticipate her reactions.,false
116,Client,Yes.,false
116,Therapist,"It’s quite insightful to be able to put yourself in someone else's shoes like that. You're almost predicting what will happen next, as if watching a movie unfold.",false
116,Client,"Exactly. When I get into trouble, my mom gives me the silent treatment, which I don't like at all.",false
116,Therapist,The silent treatment can indeed feel very isolating.,false
116,Client,"Yes, it's tough when she doesn’t talk to me even though I try to reach out.",false
116,Therapist,"That sounds really difficult. But in this instance, thinking about your mom helped you walk away and feel proud of yourself without any negative consequences.",false
116,Client,"Yes, that’s true.",false
116,Therapist,Is that correct?,false
116,Client,"Yes. Afterward, everyone stopped talking to me, even some eighth-graders who didn’t even go to my old school started saying things about me, which was creepy.",false
116,Therapist,So when others told you they see you as an easy target—,false
116,Client,"Well, I don't think they say it directly to me. It's something I've heard from my mom and other people because I keep engaging with them.",false
116,Therapist,"Okay, so they know how to engage you in a way that keeps the conversation going.",false
116,Client,Yes.,false
116,Therapist,They reel you in and then things escalate until trouble happens.,false
116,Client,Exactly. That's happened quite often.,false
116,Therapist,"It seems like when you channel your mom’s perspective, it helps you manage these situations better. You’ve almost taught yourself this strategy.",false
116,Client,Yes.,false
116,Therapist,What other strategies do you think might help in similar situations?,false
116,Client,"I was thinking that if something happens during class, I could ask to use the restroom as a way to step away and think about how to handle it calmly. Once, during gym class, there was a girl who wouldn’t talk to me. We were playing pickleball, which is like a big life-size ping pong game with a badminton-like racket.",false
116,Therapist,I'm not familiar with pickleball.,false
116,Client,"It’s similar to badminton but played on a larger court. During the game, I had to be near her again, so I quietly asked my gym teacher if we could switch courts. He did, and that helped avoid any conflict.",false
116,Therapist,That was a very smart decision on your part.,false
116,Client,The other girls were surprised by it.,false
116,Therapist,It shows how well you understand which situations might lead to trouble and how to prevent them.,false
116,Client,"Yes, I know which kids are likely to provoke me.",false
116,Therapist,So you're aware of who tends to push your buttons?,false
116,Client,"There are a few main ones, but I can't name them here.",false
116,Therapist,That's okay. What matters most is that you feel happy and safe.,false
116,Client,"And the friends I trust know not to create drama or cause trouble. Some so-called friends have even accused me of things like punching someone, which isn’t true. It’s frustrating because it makes it hard to figure out who to trust in high school.",false
116,Therapist,High school can indeed be a challenging and uncertain environment with so many students around.,false
116,Client,"Yes, there are over 1,000 kids in my grade alone, plus the sophomores add another thousand.",false
116,Therapist,That’s quite a large number of potential friends or adversaries.,false
116,Client,"Exactly. Rumors about me and my friend started circulating, and I ended up losing him because of them. It took me three months to get over it.",false
116,Therapist,Losing someone you care about must have been difficult for you.,false
116,Client,"Yes, it was hard. I thought he might be jealous because we were friends.",false
116,Therapist,So after some time passed—,false
116,Client,"Eventually, I moved on by finding other people and forgetting about the situation.",false
116,Therapist,How do you identify which friends are truly trustworthy?,false
116,Client,"It’s not necessarily those I’ve known the longest. Instead, it's the ones who spend a lot of time with me, text or call often, and have supported me in past situations. They trust me with their secrets, and that’s how I know they’re good friends.",false
116,Therapist,So you also trust them back?,false
116,Client,Yes.,false
116,Therapist,That makes sense; it goes both ways. Friends who give you the attention you want through texting or hanging out are more genuine than those pretending to be your friend but aren’t really supportive.,false
116,Client,"Exactly. I’ve had a long-time friend since fourth grade, but she started spreading lies and causing drama about me. It’s like she’s not a true friend anymore.",false
116,Therapist,What don't you like about her?,false
116,Client,"She lies frequently and creates drama without any reason. Even though we haven’t spoken since eighth grade, she still manages to cause issues that make me lose other friends.",false
116,Therapist,So it sounds like she's not worth your time.,false
116,Client,"Yes, exactly.",false
116,Therapist,How does spending time with the friends you trust feel?,false
116,Client,I do spend a lot of time with them. We hang out often.,false
116,Therapist,That’s great to hear. If you ever need extra support from them—,false
116,Client,"I ask for it when necessary, like if there's an issue at school that might lead me to the principal's office. They come down to provide backup information and support my side of the story.",false
116,Therapist,It sounds like they can offer accurate information to back up your version of events against others'.,false
116,Client,Yes.,false
116,Therapist,"You seem to have some good strategies for handling these situations, even though kids—and sometimes adults—can be quite mean. Would you consider coming back so we can continue this discussion? If you’d like, bringing a friend who might also benefit from talking could be helpful too.",false
116,Client,"Yes, there’s one friend who might want to talk about it as well. She doesn’t have much support at home and isn’t sure where else to turn.",false
116,Therapist,"I’m open to seeing her if that would help, but this session is primarily for you, Molly.",false
116,Client,"Yes, I understand.",false
116,Therapist,It sounds like she could use someone to listen to her as well. We can explore other ways to deal with these challenges because it’s clear people are being unkind without any reason.,false
116,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
116,Therapist,"Would you be willing to come back and talk more about this? I think you’re doing a great job navigating the difficulties of high school, which is no small feat. It does get better with time, at least it did for me during my freshman and sophomore years.",false
116,Client,"Yes, I’ve noticed that too.",false
116,Therapist,"You're handling things beautifully, and I’m glad to hear you’re involved in activities like swimming, which can connect you with supportive people.",false
116,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
116,Therapist,Is there anything else on your mind?,false
116,Client,"No, not right now.",false
116,Therapist,Thank you for sharing today.,false
125,Client,"The baby kept me up all night, and I'm completely worn out.",false
125,Therapist,It sounds like you've had a really challenging night with little rest.,false
125,Client,"Yes, she woke up every three hours for feeding, and it's just so confusing to me.",false
125,Therapist,"So, having her wake up every three hours for feedings was quite frustrating for you?",false
125,Client,"Exactly. My mom mentioned that I started sleeping through the night when I was only a month old, but Lilly is six weeks now.",false
125,Therapist,It seems like your mom's experience led you to expect that Lilly might be sleeping more consistently at this age.,false
125,Client,"Right, so what should I actually expect from a baby her age?",false
122,Client,I'm here because my mom insisted that I come.,false
122,Therapist,It sounds like your mom is quite concerned about you being here. How do you feel about coming?,false
122,Client,"Honestly, I don't really want to be here, but I guess it's necessary.",false
122,Therapist,You seem a bit reluctant. What are some of the thoughts going through your mind right now?,false
122,Client,"She found my stash and lost her cool over it. I'm not sure why she was looking in my things in the first place, but that’s how we ended up here.",false
122,Therapist,It sounds like discovering your stash really upset her. What do you think led to her searching through your belongings?,false
122,Client,"Lately, I've been spending time with a new group of friends who are pretty cool, and I enjoy being around them.",false
122,Therapist,You're enjoying the company of this new group of friends. How has that experience been for you?,false
122,Client,"That's about it, really.",false
122,Therapist,"So, you have these new friends you like spending time with, and your mom found your stash, which led to all of this happening. Is that right?",false
122,Client,"Yes, that sums it up.",false
122,Therapist,It seems like there might be some frustration towards your mom for going through your things. Would you agree?,false
122,Client,Absolutely. It's my stuff; I don't understand why she felt the need to—,false
122,Therapist,"It sounds like this is a private space for you, and having her go through it feels intrusive.",false
122,Client,"Exactly. I never snoop around in her belongings or her purse, so—",false
122,Therapist,"So, if you wouldn’t do that to her, why should she feel entitled to go through yours?",false
122,Client,That's exactly my point.,false
122,Therapist,It seems like there’s a sense of unfairness about the situation. How does that make you feel?,false
119,Therapist,Thank you for joining me today. Could you share what's been happening since our last session?,false
119,Client,"Well, I did manage to secure an interview for a job. Um—",false
119,Therapist,That’s wonderful news!,false
119,Client,"Yeah, but unfortunately, I couldn't attend because I didn’t have anyone to watch my kids. So that opportunity slipped away. It was actually a promising job, but now I'm not sure what to do.",false
119,Therapist,It sounds like you're feeling quite disappointed about this situation.,false
119,Client,"Yes, it is disappointing. I had no choice but to prioritize my children's care. And I’m worried this might keep happening in the future.",false
119,Therapist,So it seems like these situations are causing you to miss out on opportunities repeatedly.,false
119,Client,Yeah.,false
119,Therapist,"On a scale from one to ten, how important is it for you to secure employment?",false
119,Client,"It’s definitely a ten because I’m the sole provider for my kids, and what I receive in welfare isn’t enough. I really need a job soon.",false
119,Therapist,So you’re carrying that responsibility on your own.,false
119,Client,Yes.,false
119,Therapist,You have to ensure your children are taken care of.,false
119,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
119,Therapist,"On the same scale, how confident do you feel about getting a job?",false
119,Client,"Right now, I’d say around a three. Even if I manage childcare and attend an interview, my resume isn’t very strong—it has employment gaps and lacks education compared to others applying for similar roles. So, I don't feel particularly employable at the moment.",false
119,Therapist,"It seems like finding reliable childcare is crucial, and you’re also concerned about your resume and experience.",false
119,Client,"Yes, because my work history is limited, and even when I was employed, it wasn’t in fields that align with what I want now.",false
119,Therapist,What kind of job are you hoping to find?,false
119,Client,"I’m looking for something stable where I can be home every night after work, knowing my kids are safe at childcare. Ideally, it would pay well so I don't have to worry about finances constantly.",false
119,Therapist,So having consistent employment would significantly improve your life in many ways.,false
119,Client,"Absolutely, it would make a huge difference.",false
119,Therapist,It would provide the income you need and reduce your financial worries.,false
119,Client,"Yes, and it’d be great to have a routine I can rely on every day.",false
119,Therapist,So each day you'd know exactly what's happening.,false
119,Client,Right. And knowing my kids are well taken care of while I’m at work would ease my mind too—,false
119,Therapist,Absolutely.,false
119,Client,—because I want to ensure they’re doing well.,false
119,Therapist,"You're clearly a dedicated parent who wants the best for your children. So, what do you think it would take to increase your confidence level from a three to a five?",false
119,Client,Being able to attend interviews is my main concern right now.,false
119,Therapist,"Okay, that makes sense.",false
119,Client,So having reliable childcare in place when I have an interview scheduled—someone trustworthy I can call on—is crucial.,false
119,Therapist,"Definitely, attending the interview is essential for securing a job.",false
119,Client,"Right, exactly.",false
119,Therapist,Having dependable childcare would certainly help with that. What else might boost your confidence to a five?,false
119,Client,"I wish I had more experience or education. It seems like everyone has a college degree, and mine doesn’t stand out. When asked about it during interviews, I feel inadequate because of my lack of formal education.",false
119,Therapist,Understood. Perhaps adding something related to education or training on your resume could help you feel more confident in discussing it during interviews?,false
119,Client,"Yes, having a certification or some qualification that I can confidently talk about would be helpful.",false
119,Therapist,What fields are you considering for further education or training?,false
119,Client,"Honestly, I’m not sure yet because I need to find something quickly—I don’t have time for a four-year degree right now.",false
119,Therapist,So it sounds like you’re looking for something that can be completed in a short amount of time.,false
119,Client,"Exactly, something that provides immediate skills and helps me land a job soon, even if it’s not my ultimate career goal. It would just help me get started.",false
119,Therapist,Like a stepping stone to transition into another role later on?,false
119,Client,"Yes, exactly. As long as it's steady work with good pay.",false
119,Therapist,And it allows you to meet all your financial needs?,false
119,Client,"Right, because even the jobs I’m looking at now seem out of reach without better computer skills or something similar.",false
119,Therapist,So improving your computer skills could be beneficial for accessing these job opportunities?,false
119,Client,"Yes, I think so. My resume doesn’t highlight any technology-related skills—",false
119,Therapist,Technology skills.,false
119,Client,Yeah.,false
119,Therapist,"It sounds like securing a job is crucial right now because you need the income and want to ensure your children are well cared for. You’ve mentioned some steps that could help, such as finding reliable childcare and gaining confidence through additional training or certifications in areas like computers.",false
119,Client,"Yes, those would be great steps forward.",false
119,Therapist,What do you think should be your next move?,false
119,Client,I need to find childcare resources first—,false
119,Therapist,That’s a priority then.,false
119,Client,"It is the most pressing issue because without it, attending interviews isn’t possible. Then, maybe enrolling in some kind of short-term training program, perhaps one that offers weekend classes—",false
119,Therapist,"Yes, that sounds like a good plan.",false
119,Client,—could help me get started.,false
131,Therapist,Good morning. I'm glad you're here to discuss your journey toward quitting smoking.,false
131,Client,Good morning.,false
131,Therapist,What are your thoughts on what we can achieve together today?,false
131,Client,"Well, I need some medication if that's something you can provide.",false
131,Therapist,"Absolutely, we have the resources for that.",false
131,Client,And anything else you think might help me become smoke-free.,false
131,Therapist,Sure. Could you remind me why quitting is important to you?,false
131,Client,"Lately, I'm smoking 20 or 30 cigarettes a day and it's becoming tiresome. My friends have quit, and they seem surprised that I haven't yet.",false
131,Therapist,It sounds like there's some social pressure involved.,false
131,Client,Especially the other night at a restaurant; it was embarrassing to be the only one stepping outside for a smoke.,false
131,Therapist,"That must feel uncomfortable being alone in your habit. So, part of why you want to quit is because it’s becoming smelly and embarrassing?",false
131,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
131,Therapist,Are there other reasons as well?,false
131,Client,It's also quite expensive these days.,false
131,Therapist,How much does smoking cost you weekly?,false
131,Client,"I go through a pack a day, so about £7 each day.",false
131,Therapist,So that’s £7 per day. Does that add up to around £50 a week?,false
131,Client,"Yes, £50 a week.",false
131,Therapist,"That's quite significant. We're looking at spending £50 weekly, being one of the few smokers in your group, and not enjoying the smell. Those are three compelling reasons.",false
131,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
131,Therapist,Do you feel these reasons are strong enough to motivate you to quit?,false
131,Client,Yes.,false
131,Therapist,Great! Have you considered a specific date for when you'd like to stop smoking?,false
131,Client,What do you suggest?,false
131,Therapist,It's often helpful to choose a time with minimal other stressors in your life.,false
131,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
131,Therapist,Can you tell me what you enjoy most about smoking? Why do you smoke?,false
131,Client,"It’s mostly for entertainment. When I'm bored, it helps pass the time.",false
131,Therapist,What will you miss the most if you stop smoking?,false
131,Client,It really helps reduce my stress levels.,false
131,Therapist,Could you give an example of when smoking helps with your stress?,false
131,Client,"At work, during breaks, I need a moment to just step away and relax. Smoking is part of that process for me.",false
131,Therapist,So it's particularly helpful at the end of the day?,false
131,Client,"Yes, definitely my evening cigarette.",false
131,Therapist,That’s when you unwind after work. What do you think you might do instead on your first smoke-free day at work?,false
131,Client,"I suppose I'll just take a break and get some fresh air without smoking, maybe try to give myself regular breaks.",false
131,Therapist,Have you ever successfully quit before?,false
131,Client,I managed for a couple of weeks once.,false
131,Therapist,What caused you to start again?,false
131,Client,It was stress from an argument with my partner.,false
131,Therapist,"So something stressful triggered your return. Let me summarize what we've discussed so far. You want to stop smoking because you're the last one in your group, it's costly, and you dislike the smell. Smoking mainly helps you relax and manage stress. You'd like to choose a low-stress time to quit. When do you think would be ideal for your quit date?",false
131,Client,"I have a party this weekend, so maybe Monday morning.",false
131,Therapist,So after the party on Monday morning sounds good. We can recommend medication to increase your chances of success and help manage cravings. Many people use nicotine replacement therapy like patches or gum. Have you thought about what might work for you?,false
131,Client,"Yes, I'm considering a patch.",false
131,Therapist,"A patch is one option we have available. This medication lasts 10-12 weeks, and it's important to complete the course for the best chance of success. Quitting smoking can be challenging, but with our support here at the pharmacy, your chances are significantly higher than going it alone. You seem ready to start next week after the party.",false
131,Client,Mm-hmm.,false
131,Therapist,The time you usually smoke in the evening might be a good opportunity for change. I recommend using two products—a patch and another for immediate cravings. Can you describe what craving feels like for you?,false
131,Client,I just get irritable.,false
131,Therapist,"Irritability is one of the withdrawal symptoms we aim to prevent. I suggest starting with the patch, which I'll explain how to use, along with a second product to help manage those feelings in the first week.",false
131,Client,Okay.,false
131,Therapist,Are you comfortable with setting your quit date for next Monday?,false
131,Client,"Yes, absolutely.",false
131,Therapist,Would you like to schedule another appointment to check in?,false
131,Client,Definitely.,false
131,Therapist,"And if I don't hear from you, would a phone call be helpful?",false
131,Client,A nice phone call would be great.,false
