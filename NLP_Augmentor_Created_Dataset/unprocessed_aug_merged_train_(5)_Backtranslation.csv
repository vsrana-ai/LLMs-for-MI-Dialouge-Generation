(5)_Backtranslation
"Molly, thank you so much for coming to join me today and cheering with me."
You are welcome.
"Yes, I appreciate it. So, erm, your mother called me and said that, erm, erm, there are some problems with kids because you have problems at school and you're mean and things like that, and erm, that's a hurtful thing."
"Yes. I've stayed home from school twice, just because of the bullying and everything."
"That's a lot of school, yes, and you know."
"And when I wasn't at school, more rumors came up when I wasn't at school. I come back and how those rumors go around me. Like once when I supposedly stayed at home, I was in the principal's office all day and had security people escorting me to class, which wasn't true because I was at home all the time."
People like to make up stories.
"Since then, like fifth or sixth graders, I have been held responsible for everything that has happened."
Because why do you think wh-what kind of -
"I think because the kids - ""because I like to fiddle with things. When people tell me things, I like to talk to the person more than just let them stand, and I think the kids who like to hold me responsible for everything say that I'm an easy target to like, talk about, it's like annoying."
"So it is, er, so when you talk about how you keep nagging, tell me a bit more about it, can you give me an example of what you mean?"
"When someone says, ""Oh, I've heard that about you."" I go, ""Oh, really, what's that,"" and I just keep talking and I like to make things worse. If someone says they want to beat me up, I like to keep going and say, ""Okay, then beat me,"" and how I just don't let it be, how I just don't leave. I like to stay there and talk more."
"And - and what happens if you don't let it, what happens normally?"
"It's just like you stop it, then they don't know what to say, they're like, ""Oh, how she's leaving."" And that's how it all ends, but when I tell it, it builds up and we both get into trouble."
Okay.
- and as called to the office of the headmaster.
Okay.
- and get into the conversation.
"Okay, so and then - what does it look like for you when you get beaten up in the director's office?"
"Well, usually I try to tell myself that I just like it,"
Mm-hmm.
"- but if someone says something about me, it makes me angry, ""because what the hell, the way you talk about me, as if I was trying to stop, but sometimes I just say a few words. The way I think now, I'm trying to get better."
Mm-hmm.
"As if there was this one incident where someone was talking to me, I just said, ""Oh, wow, this is like really lame, like I'm just going to leave,"" and I like to let the conversation run."
That's pretty cool that you did that.
Yes. I was proud of myself.
"You should be proud of yourself, and how did you do it?"
"I just thought, like, ""I'm - whenever I like, I say stuff back, mom gets really angry with me, she's like,"" Well, I'm not going to help you anymore. """" Because she tells me to leave it, but I really don't listen to her to make her angry, so I tried to think about her feelings and what would happen after that when I say, ""That's lame, leave me alone,"" ""because then they like to stop and I don't get yelled at anymore."
"Er, that says a lot about you and your mother's relationship, though you can kind of get into her head and think about how she would feel about it."
Yes.
"You know what I mean? It's pretty cool, so not everyone can do that, so you could kind of put yourself at the top, uh, it's almost like watching a movie."
Yes.
- and to know how it will turn out.
"Because usually when I get into trouble, my mother gives me the quiet treatment that I don't like. It's like she doesn't talk to me, like I try to talk to her, she doesn't like panting like, uh, I don't like it."
"That's the worst, the silent treatment."
Yes.
"Yes, so, so, so, so, but that worked for you, where you just let it go, you thought of your mother, you like what we would call it, you channel to your mother, you know, and uh, you channel mother, and then, uh, you could leave, and you were proud of yourself and nothing bad happened."
Yes.
Is that true?
Yes.
Does it?
"How they all liked to stop talking to me, and the funny thing was that their eighth graders, who liked something like that, didn't even go to my old school, as if they didn't even know how to talk to me, I was like creepy."
"Yes, so - and so - when someone told you that they or people were telling you that you were an easy target, um."
"Well, they don't really tell me the way I imagine it, ""because I liked hearing it from my mother and people talk to me,"" because I keep talking to them."
Okay.
- so they keep coming back to me.
"Okay, so they kind of know how to hook you up."
Mm-hmm.
-and reel in
Yes.
"And then bad things happen, and then you get into trouble."
Yes. [giggles] It happens a lot.
"Yes. Yes, yes. And it's, er, er, um--so you know that channeling your mother helps. It sounds like you've almost taught yourself something."
Yes.
- a conversation inside. What other ideas do you have about what you could do?
"I thought, Um, when I'm like a kid at school, things happen during class."
Mm-hmm.
"- I'm just saying, can I use the washroom or something to go for a walk and imagine how to let her go, and once during my gymnastics class there was this girl that I didn't let speak that early, and we play pickleball, I don't know if you know that, it's like"
I don't know what pickleball is.
"-It is like badminton, a great table tennis ball game in life size."
It looks like a pimple ball?
"Yes, you have like a big bracket -"
There's no cucumber?
No.
Okay.
"No, [chuckles] there's no choice."
I wanted to put in and stuff.
"Mm-hmm. And as if I should turn around again. I said to myself - I went to my gymnastics teacher as if in silence and said I can't be with this person, I can go to the next court. So he gladly switched us so that I wouldn't be with her. And so it happened."
It's a really good decision.
The girls like what they like.
"Yes. No, but how clever of him to know that something bad would have happened if he had to play with her."
Yes. As if I would like to punch her in the face or something. [laughs]
You knew that.
- or something like that.
You knew that.
Yes.
So you actually know which children
"Yes, it is like this:"
-know how to press the buttons you really carry inside you.
"Yes, there are four main points, but not so that I can say who."
"That's fine. Yes, because that's not important, the most important thing is that you're happy."
"And the friends I have as I know them are my true friends, they are like those who do not cause or like drama -"
Er-huh.
"I mean, they might like it, but they don't like it that bad, and they even like to help me, like some of these girls who like so-called girlfriends."
Er-huh.
"- They're like they come to me and say, ""Oh, do you really have to like this girl?"" I'm like, ""No."" It's like you're not a boyfriend, if you really believe that, you know what I mean?"
Yes.
"Yeah, it's kind of annoying because it's so hard to go to high school and know how to believe and who doesn't."
"Yes. That's - that's - it's really big unknown territory. Pressure high school class probably consists of 1,000 kids."
"Yes, 1003."
"1,003 children."
"And then there are the runners-up, which you have like another 1,000, so it's like this:"
""
Yes.
"-potential enemies, friends, who knows which."
"Yes, it was with these words that the first rumors began to circulate like my friend and I, and how I lost him just because there were rumors. It's like, what the hell. As if I couldn't overcome him like a talker, who knows, it was like three months and I had just overcome him after all."
That must have been hard for you.
Yes.
Yes.
"I was like really, you're probably just jealous because I was friends with him or something."
Mm-hmm. But after three months time flew by.
Yes.
- and you will -
I just found it like other people and just forgot about it.
"Okay. And how else do you know who your friends are, that you can really trust who you back?"
"I tell the ones who don't even like that I know them the longest, but the ones who actually hang out with me a lot, send me a lot of text messages or call me. And the ones who are actually like that have helped you before in similar situations, and that they tell you things and know that they can trust you, just like one of my friends tells me everything about her, and so I know that she is a good friend because she trusts me with things."
You trust her then?
Yes.
"Okay. Well, that makes a lot of sense to that folks - it goes both ways."
Mm-hmm.
"You know. And, um--So and for you, friends who give you, er, somehow, er, the attention you want."
Yes.
"phone and you hang out with them, and so on, instead of pretending to be a friend."
Mm-hmm.
-if you know that they might gonna--
"Yes, it happens a lot to me as it does to a lot of friends, like this one person we've been friends with since fourth grade."
Mm-hmm.
"And how she just starts lying and just talking about me, and it's like you're not a good friend at the time, like I thought you were a friend since you've been my friend since our fourth grade."
Mm-hmm.
"And how she came - Like the friends I met in high school, she came into it, like, you're not going to know - in college you don't know who to follow - because you're always following my friends, what are you going to do in college, like not being able to find your own friends? It's kind of annoying because they're my friends and how I can't be with her and she comes to my friends."
Mm-hmm.
"-Get your own friends, [giggles] stop following me."
Mm-hmm. Wh-what don't you like about her?
She just lies a lot and likes to start dramas about me and I haven't even talked to her since eighth grade. We just went to school together and she just likes me losing other friends because of the drama she starts.
"Okay, so she sounds like she is, um--"
A nobody. I will say that. She is like -
Or not.
Yes.
"It's not worth your time, so what if you really only spend time with the friends you know they really are?"
"I spend a lot of time with them, just as I hang out with them a lot."
Good. That's really good. Yes. And if you like some additional support from them -
Ask for it. Yes.
"Right, and what kind of things do you ask them to do?"
"I just ask them if I feel like going to the principal's office to see how something is happening, I call them to support my backup information."
"""Because they can. They can give you some, er, information, like, er, um--they can give you some accurate information, er, and back up your story against the other person's story."
Yes.
"So, okay. So we - you know what? Er, it sounds like you actually have some pretty good ideas about, um, how to handle it, and yet kids - I know kids - can actually be really mean adults. But, er, I know in high school, i-it's really bad."
Yes.
"So I wonder if we could, er, if you wanted to, sit down and keep talking because you already have some good ideas, and I'm very open that if you wanted to bring one of your good friends along, that would be really cool."
Yes.
Would that be something?
"Yes, there is a friend who would like to talk about it."
Yes.
"And she is really likeable - she doesn't know how to talk to whom, because her mother isn't always there for her."
Okay.
And so it is as if she does not know where to go.
Yes.
How she doesn't know who to believe.
"Well, I wish this session was for you anyway, Molly."
Yes.
"I mean, I'm ready to see them, you know."
Yes.
It sounds as though she really needs it - she'd like someone to listen to her.
Yes.
"Yeah. So, erm, we could maybe talk about some other ways to, erm, help, erm, deal with it because, erm, it sounds like, erm, people are, you know, just being old with no good darn reason mean to you."
Mm-hmm.
"Yeah. And, um, so would you be willing to come back and talk about it? Okay. Okay. And I just want you to know that I think you're doing, um, a really good job, um, dealing with how hard it is to be in high school because it's difficult."
Yes.
It is.
That struck me.
"Yes. And it's tough, and I think it's getting better. My experience was that it got a little bit better."
Mm-hmm.
"But anyway, I think you hang in there nicely, and I love to hear you participate in swimming and other things because they have to help you connect with something pretty - I would hope -"
Yes.
"- [incomprehensible 00: 13: 12] People. So okay, something else? No? Okay. Everything is fine."
Mm-hmm.
Thank you very much.
"You made your declaration of values, and that was part of what I wanted to discuss with you today. I wanted to hear about your values and just talk a little more about them. Do you want to tell me what some of your top five values are?"
"Yes, er, my highest value is family happiness, er, that."
That's number one?
"s number one for me, especially now. I usually make this declaration of values, about every two to three months."
Mm-hmm.
"- just to see if anything has changed, and every time it has changed."
Oh. So the value of the family is the most important thing for you right now?
Yes.
Family happiness?
"Yes, it is the most important thing because it is missing a little bit, so I know that is very important to me."
Okay. Want to talk more about it?
"Yeah. Um, I can just about say that my family was out of line, so I feel like we could all just fall into the middle that I know everyone doesn't really follow. So, erm, I think for my part, ""because I can't change anyone, it's to be more present and, erm, just listen and understand my family members, and - and to be able to express what I feel as far as how important family happiness is to me."
"Mm. Because although it is important to you, they may not know that it is important to you."
Yes.
Do you say that? Yes?
Yes.
And you want them to know?
"And I want them to know how important it is to me, especially now, and I do this, as I said, every two to three months, just to see where I am."
Er-huh.
"And, er, that's definitely different than -"
Okay.
-which I usually choose.
Okay.
"Um, and then I said, the second one is religion. Um, it was number one at first, um, but somehow in a big situation that happened in my family, you lose faith a little bit, which is normal, and not many people - they, er - Well, in my church it just seems like, ""Oh, you lost contact with God, oh my God, you're the devil."""
Er-huh.
"You know? And it's kind of like we're all facing these challenges every day, we're not perfect, you know? And I feel like my faith is still there, but it's - you know, as long as it's still there, that's all that matters."
"Right. So at the moment, is it really important for you to put family values first? And religion is still very important for you, but you feel that you might lose a little faith?"
"Yes. I have lost faith, and therefore I am not afraid to say it."
Er-huh.
"You know? And when you say [incomprehensible 00: 03: 12], people who don't really feel like that is -"
Because you know other people are experiencing it.
"Yes, I know that."
So you know it's normal.
I know it's normal.
But sometimes people don't talk about it.
"Yes, well, it's a -"
Especially in the Church.
"Yeah, it's kind of a shock to them when you say something like that, and it's like, ""Well, we're going through all the things that we're just not sure about, and -"" I still have a little bit, I'm not saying I've gone off track, you know? I still have a little bit to do, and the little bit that I have is the positive things in my life that I look at and I'm like, ""Okay, I'm not in that situation, so I'm grateful,"" and -"
Mm-hmm.
"- You know, I would still have confidence to carry on, but sometimes you have the feeling: ""Where is God?"""
Yes.
You know?
And it sounds as if you are in a place of acceptance in this respect too.
Yes.
"Er, that's fine with you, and you know it's going to change because that was your, er, experience."
Yes.
"They have distributed numerous handouts to clarify values, and each time they are different."
Mm-hmm.
-so that you know that it will change.
Yes.
And do you accept that?
"I accepted that. At first I was like ""whoa,"" I think I was too focused on the first time."
Mm-hmm.
- then the second time I did it - I have five of these total
Mm-hmm.
"- but the second time I did it, I was so focused: ""What was the last time I read about?"" You know?"
Yes.
"So, and I just kept going and blanked it out, and I just went and I was like, ""Oh, I'm going to do this."""
Yes.
"And I was like, ""Oh wow."""
"I really applaud you for being open-minded enough to realise that where you are now is not necessarily where you are, that you don't always have to have the same thing."
"Mm-hmm, and that's what I felt. At first I thought, ""Isn't that normal?"" You know?"
Mm-hmm.
But I noticed that people are going through something every day. I am experiencing things in life. Things are going to change.
Mm-hmm.
"Things don't stay as they are. Um, you know, maybe you're here, you're going to go there, you're going to go there, you're not necessarily going to say you're going to fall over, but your view of life changes, the more experience, the more life, every day."
Yes.
"- Every day your eyes - Well, for me my eyes have become wider, wider and wider. So -"
Correct.
"I don't limit myself to changing, I just kind of fill it out, and then [incomprehensible 00: 05: 38] I'm like, ""Okay."""
All right.
"That's cool, so I'm more focused on that than the unnecessary stuff in my life."
"Mm-hmm. Do you feel that there are parts of your life where you want to be more in tune with your values, or do you really feel on the right track with them?"
"Um, I mentioned before that it was kind of out of place for me, because when I did that one particular, um, as-as-did, I explained that there was - the other three were important to me, but I didn't focus on that, so I'm like, ""Okay, it's important to me,"" so I lost track of that and the other three -"
The other three?
"Um, number three was health."
Mm-hmm.
"Number four is inner harmony, and number five is security."
"Internal harmony, health and safety -"
Yes.
- are the other three?
Mm-hmm.
And the two most important are family happiness and religion?
And religion.
"Okay, and the other three - inner harmony - let me see if I can remember. Inner harmony, health and, what was the other?"
Security.
Security.
Yes.
"Inner harmony, health and safety."
Yes.
Do you feel that you are not paying them as much attention as you would like?
"Yes, because when I saw it, I thought, ""Okay, yes, this is one, this is one, and this is one."""
Mm-hmm.
""
Is it because you spend a lot of time with the first two or?
"A lot of my time is spent with, er, number one."
Mm-hmm.
"- and, er, I learned something about the other way of looking at self-esteem."
Mm-hmm.
- and I definitely appreciate others.
Er.
"So I had, um, less time to have some inner harmony."
"Oh yes, right: the family came first so much that you kind of stepped into the background?"
Yes.
You are not even in it - are you even on the timetable? Is the point of the time in one day? Is most of it going to your family?
"Most of it goes to everything else, just not me."
Okay.
"And, er, I don't even like -"
It will be difficult to achieve inner harmony.
Yes.
- if you always walk around and take care of everyone.
And I feel that inner harmony comes first with sleep. [Laughter] I have not been able to sleep lately.
Correct.
""
Yes.
"-I think this is the first step, but I am just overwhelmed, erm, but I want to regain this inner harmony, this inner peace."
Okay.
"- because when I was, you know, 18, I was just like, free, open-minded. I lived life, now that I look at it, like a fairy tale."
Mm. Mm-hmm.
"And so I knocked on the door and reality said, ""This is not a fairy tale."" Um, you're on board now."
Okay.
"And so I was like, ""It's not about you, you know, it's about everyone else."""
Mm. So something dramatic happened?
Yes.
That kind of shocked you from that fairytale life.
Mm-hmm.
- and to take care of all the others?
Yeah-
Okay.
"-Definitely, and the shock just continues."
"Okay. Well, I've really enjoyed having the time to sit down and talk to you about your values. I hope it's been helpful to you, and in the future, if I can help in any way to give some of those other values a little bit more attention, we can talk about it next time."
Thank you for listening.
Okay. All right? You are welcome.
Mr. Johnson?
Yes?
"Er, I'm here to talk to you about, er, your cholesterol and the, er, medicine your doctor prescribed for you."
"Er, I've talked to my doctor about my medicine, that's his job."
"But now, it's also my job, er, to help you understand how to use your medicine and, er, give you information about how to get the most out of it."
"Well, to be honest, I'm not even sure if I'm going to take the drug. Now, I know I have high cholesterol, I have to get that down, but on the other hand, this drug can cause severe muscle weakness and I just can't afford it. I'm a truck driver and I carry these heavy boxes of dolls in and I just can't afford it, so you know."
"So your doctor has told you that if your cholesterol remains elevated, you are at risk of a stroke or heart attack?"
"Yes, right across the board, but"
"Okay. Well, the side effect is something that is very, very rare, it's not really something to worry about, and the risk of stroke or heart attack is much worse."
"Well, right now it's muscle weakness that I'm worried about, and that's, uh, you know, that's the present, uh, I've got to do my job."
"Well, I-I understand that. Um, but as I said, it's very rare. If you feel muscle weakness, let your doctor know. It's not permanent, okay? Yes, it won't go into the blood - it won't get to the point where it affects your work -"
"Well, you know - why don't you just give me the medicine, I'll take it home and I'll think about it? But you know, I'm worried about my job."
"You really need to take it, and - as I said - muscle weakness is rare. If you feel muscle weakness, let your doctor know. He can undress or switch you off. It does not last."
Sure. Beautiful. Just -
It doesn't last.
Anyway.
"Okay? So a stroke or heart attack is much worse, so make sure you take your medicine with you while you're on the way out, and, er, one-on-one every day to lower your cholesterol."
"Okay, for sure."
Okay.
"Hi Kaylie, it looks like you are here today to pick up a recipe."
Yes. My doctor said he had called something.
Okay. It looks like cholesterol statin. Do you know how to take this medicine?
"No, not really."
"Well, you only take it once a day, did he tell you what side effects to expect?"
No.
"Well, some of the most common ones are nausea, vomiting, headache. There are some severe ones like dermatomyositis, liver failure, lupus, rhabdomyolysis, hemorrhagic brain infarction. If you have any of these, just call your doctor."
"Okay. Er, why do I take this medicine?"
"It's for your dyslipidemia. Oh yes, just one tablet a day. Do you have any questions for me?"
"No, I don't think so."
Nice. Have a good day.
"Hi Kaylie, I see you are here today to pick up a recipe."
Yes. My doctor said he had called something.
"Oh, it looks like he took cholesterol statin. Do you know how to take this medicine?"
"No, not really."
"Okay. Well, you take this once a day. Did he tell you what side effects to expect?"
No.
"Good. Well, some of the most common side effects are nausea, vomiting, headache. There are some serious side effects such as dermatomyositis, liver failure, lupus, rhabdomyolysis, hemorrhagia, brain infarction. If you have such, you should consult your doctor."
"Okay. Er, why do I take this medicine?"
"It's for your dyslipidemia. Oh, and you should take one every day. Do you have any questions for me?"
I don't think so.
"Great. Well, have a good afternoon."
"Hello Kaylie, I'm Lori, the pharmacist here at the Bulldog Pharmacy. I see that you have a new prescription for cholesterol statin 20 that was called today by Dr. Ferris. I wondered if you would have a minute to talk to me. I just want to make sure you know how best to take it and if you have any questions."
Sure. I'm just buying a few purchases.
Okay. Why did the doctor give you cholesterol statin?
"Well, he told me I had a blood test for cholesterol and that I should start."
"He's right. This medication is designed to lower your cholesterol level, and that means it helps lower your risk of a heart attack or stroke. How did your doctor tell you to take this medication?"
"He didn't really tell me, he just called me."
"Okay. Well, you take a cholesterol statin 20 tablet once a day, with or without food. When do you usually take your medication?"
"Well, I take all my other medications before I go to bed, so I think I could take them then."
"Okay. That's perfect, because cholesterol works best when taken at night, although you can take it at any time of the day, and you should take it every single day. It's important that it stays that way. Where do you store your medications?"
"I store my medication, er, on my bedside table, right next to my bed."
"Well, do you have children at home?"
No.
"Okay. This sounds like a perfect place for you. Medications work best if they are protected from light, heat, and moisture. What did the doctor tell you about the side effects?"
He did not comment.
"Good. Well, this drug is pretty well tolerated, which means it doesn't have many side effects, but you might have some mild muscle pain. If it seems really bad to you, then you should call Dr. Ferris and talk to him about it. Also, this drug can interact with many other medications, and even with over-the-counter things. So, ask your doctor or me before you start anything new. Finally, grapefruit juice can interact with cholesterol statin 20. So if you use grapefruit juice every day, I would probably switch to a different juice while you are taking this medication."
"So that I know we are on the same page, can you tell me again how you are going to take this medicine?"
"Sure. I only take one tablet before I go to bed with my other medications, and I think I will switch to orange juice. And if I notice severe muscle pain, I immediately call Dr. Ferris."
"Great, Kaylie. I know we went through a lot today. What other questions do you have for me?"
"Er, I think you answered all my questions. Thank you."
"Fantastic. All right. Well, here's your recipe. I even put it on auto-fill for you so it will be filled at the same time for you every month. And if you have any questions later, our phone number is right here on the bottle, and you can call me anytime. Thank you. Have a nice day."
"Hello Kaylie. I am Lori, the pharmacist here at the Bulldog Pharmacy. I see that you need to pick up a new medicine today. Dr. Ferris called me about cholesterol statin 20. Do you have a minute to talk about it? I want to make sure you know how best to take this medicine and answer any questions you might have."
Sure. I'm just buying a few purchases.
All right. Why did the doctor give you cholesterol statin?
"He told me that I had a blood test for cholesterol, so I should start taking this medicine."
This medicine will help you to lower your cholesterol level and it will help you to lower your risk of a heart attack or stroke. How did the doctor tell you to take this medicine?
"He didn't tell me, he just called it."
"Good. Well, you take a cholesterol statin 20 tablet once a day, with or without food. When do you usually take your medication?"
"I take all my other medications before I go to bed, so I think I could take them then."
"This medication can be taken at any time of day, but it works best when taken in the evening and it is important to take it every day."
Where do you store your medication?
I store them all on the bedside table next to my bed.
Do you have children in your house?
"No, I don't have children."
"This sounds like a perfect place to store these medicines. Medicines are best kept away from light, heat, and moisture."
What did your doctor tell you about the side effects?
He did not comment.
"Well. Well, this medication is generally well tolerated, which means that it does not have many side effects, but you may have some muscle pain or pain. If you find it really bad, then you should call Dr. Ferris and talk to him about it. Also, this medicine may interact with over-the-counter medications or even other medications, so before you start anything new, you should consult either Dr. Ferris or me. Finally, this medication can interact with grapefruit juice. So while you are taking this medication, I would avoid grapefruit juice."
"So that we know we are on the same page, can you tell me again how you are going to take this medicine?"
"Sure. I only take one tablet of the cholesterol statin, erm, in the evening along with all my other medications. And I think I switch to orange juice. And if I notice severe muscle pain, I will certainly call Dr. Ferris right away."
"This is great, Kaylie. I know that we went through a lot today. What questions do you have for me?"
I think you answered all my questions. Thank you.
"Good, good. Well, here's your recipe. I even put it on autofill for you so that it will be ready for you every month at the same time. And if you have any questions later, our phone number is right here on the bottle and you can call me anytime. Thank you. Have a nice day."
"Hello, Dr. Martin. I heard that you had a question for me. What did you want to talk about?"
"I'm sorry, but are you the pharmacist? I just had a question about citalopram."
"Yes, I am a pharmacist on duty. Citalopram, okay. It is an antidepressant and comes in strengths of 10, 20 and 40 milligrams. It is excreted in the urine and has a half-life of about 35 hours. For side effects there are sexual side effects, heart side effects and stomach side effects."
"Okay, but I just wanted to know if it interacts with phenelzine?"
"Oh, uh, yeah, I think that should be fine."
"Okay, thank you for that. I have an appointment to run."
"All right, thank you. Give me a call anytime."
"Hello, Mrs. Smith. I wanted to let you know that we will be giving Lilly some vaccinations at this time."
"Oh, I-I don't know if I'm comfortable with it. I've read a lot about it lately."
Hmm. Can you tell me more about your concerns about vaccines?
"Er, yes, I was right - I read that it is better to let them build up their immunity, just as naturally and so on in their immune system."
"Okay, so did you think that maybe it would be a better choice to expose Lily to these diseases naturally than to use vaccinations to help her become stronger?"
"I mean, I had chicken pox as a kid, and now I'm immune."
"That's right. Having chickenpox as a child means that you are less likely to have chickenpox as an adult because you have developed natural immunity. Er, but is it okay if I could offer you a little more information about the other vaccines we have - we would give it lily today?"
"Er, okay."
"Okay. So, uh, before vaccines were developed, children often, when they had natural contact with some of these diseases, caused death, disability, measles brain damage and, uh, deafness and blindness. Polio caused, uh, paralysis in children. And so it was sometimes a little gamble to allow children natural contact with these diseases, it could be dangerous."
"Wow, I didn't know it was that dangerous. I've never heard of polio."
"Hmm. Some of the things I mentioned to you are not familiar to you. Er, and I think that's because we have eradicated some of these diseases so well that many people your age, and even my age, are not familiar with these things. Er, what do you think of the idea of vaccination for Lilly after you've shared this information with you?"
"Er, I guess it's fine. I mean, I just want her to be healthy and safe."
It is really important that you make sure she is protected and that you make good decisions and research before you make any medical decisions for her.
"Yes, I just want to do the right thing."
"Hello Mrs. Smith, my name is Terri, I am one of the nurses working with Dr. Fields."
"Well, I remember you. Yes, we've met before."
"Yes, I think the last time you were there."
Yes.
"And I know that the last time Dr. Fields talked to you about it, maybe trying a Tai Chi course to see how it would work, and I wanted to check in with you and see how Tai Chi was going."
"Well, I went once."
Er-huh.
"Yes, and, erm, it was very nice to see and the teacher was very nice, but I felt kind of self-conscious because I'm still in my scooter."
Er-huh.
"And I had to sit in the chair. You know, I couldn't do what they were doing."
Mm-hmm.
So it was - I just felt confident.
"Er-huh. So, you thought it was nice and you liked Teacher, but you were a little self-conscious because you were in a chair?"
Very confident.
"Very confident, uh-huh."
Yes.
"What did you hope to achieve with, er, Tai Chi?"
"Now, as Dr. Fields told me, it helps with balance, and I still have the wobbles. So I really hoped that I would get to the point where I could benefit from what they had to offer. Um, yes, mainly my balance, mainly my balance."
"Er-huh. So you hoped it would help balance, but you didn't see it - maybe the results you were looking for?"
Not yet.
Not yet.
Yes.
Er-huh. What is your overarching goal? What are you working towards?
I want to go home.
Er-huh.
"Yes, I do."
"Mm-hmm, and what is important to you when you come home?"
[sighs] Everything. I want to be with my little dog.
Mm-hmm.
He is really so sweet and I miss my garden.
Yes.
"And I just miss being independent, going to sleep when I want to sleep, and getting up when I want to get up - and, er, cooking for myself."
"Er-huh. So you want to go home to your dog, your garden, back to your life, your independence?"
Yes.
Mm-hmm.
Yes.
What do you think you need to do to achieve this goal of coming home?
"Well, they told me that I had to be able to walk down the hallway and back, even with the roller, safely and not with the wobble."
Er-huh.
And I'm not there yet.
And do you agree that you need to do just that to get home?
Yes.
Er-huh.
I don't want to fall.
Er-huh.
"I-I had friends to whom this happened. So, er, I-I agree a little, with some hesitation, but I agree."
"Er-huh, and tell me how your physical therapy works?"
"Oh, it's better."
Mm-hmm.
It still hurts. I feel good. I feel better. I feel better. It's not quite as painful.
Mm-hmm.
"Yes, so."
"So it sounds like, erm, you can see that you're making progress in physical therapy."
Yes.
- and that you hoped that Tai Chi would help you shake. Uh-huh?
Yes.
So do you want to go back to Tai Chi?
"[sighs] Um, yeah, I do it because - my friend, I think I told you - I really love it and I just wish I could go back, and yeah, I do. I don't make much sense, but I do."
"Er-huh. I think it's important, er, that you know you're the one who has to make the decision whether Tai Chi works for you or not."
"Oh, I don't really know after a while."
Er-huh.
"Yes. It's like that - I can't do that - it wouldn't be fair for me to say it works or not. It didn't happen once, but you know."
So you haven't seen the results you want.
Yes.
-but because Dr. Fields recommended it and your friend did not -
Yes.
- and it sounds as if you are the lecturer -
"Yes, I do."
- it sounds as if you would like to try again and give it a chance?
"Yes, I would."
So what do you need to do to get back to Tai Chi?
"Well, I would have to do the arrangements again, it was a bit complicated, and, erm, I would have to clear my head to feel confident, because I-I know that no one really looks at me, but I have to convince myself."
Er-huh.
"Yes, and the arrangement, the arrangements a bit complicated."
"Uh-huh. So how safe are you on a scale of 1 to 10, with one not confident at all and 10 very confident that you can make the arrangements to get to Tai Chi?"
That I can make the deal?
Mm-hmm.
Five.
Five.
Yes.
"Er-huh, so."
"I mean, I know I can do it, but it's really hard."
"Er-huh. What is it that makes them a five instead of a one, no trust?"
That I do it on my own.
Mm-hmm.
And I would really feed - if I could have some support - as if someone could help me with that.
Er-huh.
"My daughter can't come to visit so often and,"
Er-huh.
Yes.
"So to make you feel more confident, would you like some help with these arrangements?"
I would do it.
Er-huh.
I would do it.
And is this something your daughter can do for you?
"Well, she could, but I'd have to wait at least a week."
"Okay. Um, so is this something we would like to help you with?"
I would do it.
Er-huh.
"Yes, yes. Is that possible?"
Of course we can make these arrangements with the rehab centre.
Er-huh.
"-and-and they have done this for other patients, so we can certainly make these arrangements if you want."
"That would be good, and in terms of self-confidence, I would have to do it myself."
Okay. So are there any other obstacles or obstacles on the way to Tai Chi?
"Um, I can't think of anything."
Okay.
That is the most important thing.
All right.
- the rules.
"Well, it sounds as if you are making progress in your physical therapy."
Yes.
"And that you want to give Tai Chi another chance, and that if we can help you to take the van to the rehab center, you will give Tai Chi another chance."
Yes.
Okay.
That's true.
"Well, erm, before you leave today, let's move on and, erm, I'll call the rehab center and make those arrangements."
Would you?
Sure. I'm happy to do that.
That would really help.
"And then, when you come back, I know that you have another follow-up appointment with Dr. Fields. I would like to talk to you again and see how the course went the second time."
Okay.
All right.
"Yes, thank you."
"Well, thank you for coming here today, Mrs Smith, and I look forward to hearing about the progress you are making."
Okay.
"Hello, Dr. Martin. I am Lori. I am the pharmacist on duty today. I understand that you have some questions about the drug citalopram. Do you have a minute to talk about it?"
"Yes, I do, but only for a few minutes."
"Well, do you have any specific questions?"
"Um, nothing specific. I'm just not familiar with the drugs."
"Okay. Well, citalopram is an SSRI drug. Its indication is for depression and it is usually dosed as a 20 milligram tablet, but it is available as 10, 20 and 40 milligrams."
"Okay. Er, what about side effects?"
"If there are any side effects, they may include GI effects, sedation or sexual dysfunction, but if you have a patient who suffers from all of these things, you can either try to reduce the dose or replace it with another drug. Do you have any other questions?"
"Um, what about phenelzine?"
"Oh, I'm not sure. Er, can I answer you this afternoon with this answer?"
"Oh, for sure."
Fantastic. Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Did you like the way your parents raised you?
Tell me how your parents raised you?
Tell me how you felt?
Okay. I guess I got bigger.
"Mm, how is that for you?"
"Er, scary, I think."
So you feel uncomfortable with changes in your body?
"Yes. I-I know there's something in it, I just don't know much about him."
""
"I know you want me to go to the doctor, I haven't called yet."
Why do you think it makes you so hesitant to call?
"I don't know, it seems overwhelming to me."
"What about her, seems overwhelming?"
"Well, I hate making calls, and I know I have to fill out all this paperwork. I don't know how to get there, and I hate needles."
"Mm. Some of your feelings, erm, the overload or logistics of the appointment, and some of them are just not pleasant for you with doctor's appointments and medical staff?"
Yes.
How can I help you with these things?
Can you help me make the call?
"Sure, we can do it together."
Can you go with me to the appointment?
"I cannot guarantee it because it depends on my schedule, but we can think about who can support you so that you feel better about participating."
"Hello, Rick."
Kia ora.
"Good to see you here. I see in your file that you are, er, [incomprehensible 00: 01: 18]."
"Yes, that's right."
What part of the [incomprehensible 00: 01: 22] are you from?
I'm from the South.
"Oh, okay."
Mm-hmm.
At the bottom? Bluff at the bottom?
"Yes sir. I'm from Invercargill, just before Bluff. My whole family is still down there."
"Oh, are they? So you were born down there and"
Mm-hmm.
-grew up down there?
Mm-hmm.
Country boy. How long did I grow up in Christchurch?
I've been up here since I was 18.
"Oh, so you've been here a while?"
Just a little while. Yes.
"Oh good, you have family out here?"
"Er, just my own."
"[incomprehensible 00: 01: 51]. Well, Rick, I'm kind of, uh, interested in it, you know, you and I are going to work together for a while. I kind of wonder what thoughts you would have today on your way here."
"Um, I was thinking about what you would ask me, what I would say. I was thinking about my children, about having to take a day off from work."
Correct.
It's a bit of a slut.
"Okay. I see you have a bit of experience with, er, coming to prevention services."
Mm-hmm.
How was that for you in the past?
"Er, it was okay. Er, it wasn't bad."
Correct.
"t know. Virtually nothing, really."
Okay. Similar insults in the past that brought you back this time?
Yes.
"One of the, um, things I've learned over the years, Rick, is that a lot of people go outside the door and don't come in and, um, you came in. What does that tell me about you?"
"Um, I hope it says I want to make, er, some changes."
Yes.
Mm-hmm.
So is this different from when you were here before?
Yes. And I still had to walk through those doors.
Yes.
"- but, erm, I just think of my children, you know."
Yes. So they are really important to you?
Yes.
Yes. And do you have your children with you full-time or
"No. No, I don't. I see her, er, once every fortnight."
Okay. And how is that for you?
It sucks.
Mm-hmm.
Yes.
What do you really want to do for yourself and your children?
I agree - I'd like to be able to see them whenever I can and whenever I want.
Yes.
"You know, I, um, they're my whole world and - and I messed things up."
Correct.
"So, you know."
"So if you come to me and you and I work together, then you make a program, how important is that for you and your children?"
That is really important.
"Mm-hmm. If I put it on a scale of, say, 1 to 100, where 1 wouldn't really matter, 100 would be really, really important, where would you be on that scale?"
"It's, uh, uh, it's difficult because I'm, uh, not a bad person. I've just done some stupid shit, but I'm not a bad person."
Correct.
I would be 100-100 per cent with my kids.
Correct.
If it means saying I can see my kids whenever I want.
"Yes. What do you think it would be like for your children if they were sitting here now and they heard you say that this is really, really important for you and for them? That you gave this program 100%. Well, how could it be for them to hear this?"
"Um, I-I-hope they would be proud of me. I don't want my kids to see me here, but I-I hope they would be proud of me."
Okay.
'Because I'm - yeah.
Good. Anyone else in your family who would be really proud - that you are taking these steps?
"Er, oh, my mother."
Yes. Is your mother still down in the South?
Yes.
Yes. Does she know you are here today?
No.
So how could it be for her if she knew you were talking like that today?
"Yes, I am."
Yes.
"I just don't know where to start, I don't know."
So do you think that this programme and the completion of this programme would be a good start?
"Yes, I hope so. So I would really want to do it, I really want to do something to help myself. I don't purposely package things for myself."
"Yes. So you and I will work together a little bit. And, um, and sometimes it can be pretty tough. And I just wonder, before we move on, when it comes down to it, that a lot of people help out. I just wonder if you're one of those guys?"
"No, that's important to me."
Correct.
"I have, um, I have - it's important to me."
"Good. One of the other things we're really aware of is, um, sometimes we do this work in isolation from others, and one of the things we want to ask people is, who are they going to account for? I think like with your children, er, your mother and other people you might interact with. Who else in your life do you think would you support, and who would you have to tell them that you're actually doing this kind of program?"
"I, erm, I'm currently separated from my misunderstanding and"
What was your partner's name?
"Er, Kirsty."
Kristy.
"I'd love her to know I do and that she knows I mean it, but, erm, I know she wouldn't actually do shit right now."
Right. Would you support your employer?
"Er, yes, I don't know. Maybe, but I don't know if I want them to know."
Okay. What do you think it might be like for you to explore this with them?
"Er, I don't know."
"All the other family members who live, er, close by, er, do you think would be supportive?"
I'm pretty alone up here.
"Okay. The reason I'm asking this, Rick, is simply, uh, you know, to be part of, uh, uh, being responsible is to stand up and do the program."
Mm-hmm.
"The other aspect is something like who we have to account for while we are running the program, so one of the challenges, one of the puzzles I'm going to face is, who else can we engage to support you while you're going through this?"
"Um, I don't know. I don't have, er, that many people."
Okay.
"I don't have that many people I trust to support me. My mates, I love them, but, um, yeah, I don't know."
"Okay. So how we do this work together and go through this program, erm, one of the things we - we don't want to - is to fall into the same trough that we did last time. So I-I just want to leave that with you so that you can think about when we next get together. There are maybe two or three other people that you think can be really supportive, that we-we need to let you know that you [incomprehensible 00: 10: 50] are going to make these changes and that you're serious about it this time. So let your mom and, erm, and, your partner, how could that happen? How does that sound to you?"
"Yes, let us think about it."
"Rick, I have a feeling you are doing this walk a bit alone at the moment."
"Yes, that will definitely be true."
"Your family is down in the south. I mean, who else do you think would be really interested in supporting you and rowing with you when you feel like this trip?"
"Er, I have a good relationship with my mother, -"
Okay.
- with my brothers and sisters.
Yes.
My mother is actually quite important to me.
"Yes. What would it be like for your mother, do you think, if you told her that this is something that you really care about and that you know that this time you really need to do this for her and for the family? What-could it be for her to hear?"
I think she would be proud of me.
"Yes, all right."
Yes.
"Brothers and sisters, that, er, would also be very helpful if you made this journey?"
"Yes. Yes. A good, er, good family."
"Good. So how would you get them to support you, come on board and give an account of this collaboration?"
"Um, I don't know. Um, you have someone who just listens."
"And, erm, I'm just trying to imagine what do you think your mother would say to you if she were sitting here with us now and heard you talk about it?"
She would tell me that she loves me. She would tell me that she believes that I could make it.
"MM. What do you think she wants for you, like she wants for your children?"
"So that they have a father, they can look up to him."
I have a strong feeling that this is what you want.
That's what I want. Definitely.
Where do you think you have the confidence to do this with the support of your whānau and ours?
"If I had their support for my family and [silence] I would say that it would be higher. I just know that I botched it in the past. If they were there to support me now, I would be 99% sure."
"This is a huge step up, isn't it? So it will be really important for us to bring your family on board, to bring your whānau on board."
Yes.
Tell me what you know about the flu season?
"Er, I know the flu can be pretty bad, but I'm in pretty good health, so I don't really feel like I need it. Er, it's just more for old people, right?"
"Mm, um, so do you think it's really just for people who are susceptible to disease?"
Yes.
Would it be okay if I could give you a little more information about the flu vaccine and its importance?
Okay.
"So you are right that you are young and healthy and do not have many complicated diseases that mean that you would probably be fine if you got the flu, but we know that older people are at higher risk, pregnant women, babies are at risk of severe complications from the flu, and when you get the vaccine it prevents you from passing it on to other people."
Okay.
"So, after sharing this information, what do you think of the idea of the flu vaccine?"
"Well, my grandparents probably wouldn't handle the flu very well."
""
"- and my colleague is pregnant, too."
Mm-hmm.
"So, yes, I guess I should get it for her sake."
"Okay, so you have some people in your life who are susceptible to possible illnesses, and this decision to get the flu will help protect them."
Yes.
Hello. Are you Julie Thompson?
Mm-hmm.
"Hello, I'm Bruce Berger. I work in the clinic and, er, I noticed you're there to pick up a prescription for Sarah's, er, emergency inhalation."
Mm-hmm.
- because of her asthma. I noticed that she was in the emergency room five times last year because of her asthma. How was that - how was it for you?
"It was really hard. Er, I hate to see her gasping for air. And, um, I'm really worried, you know, when she has to go. Er, that's it. It's really hard when I have to take her."
"Yes, it sounds as if you are prepared to do everything in your power to try to prevent this."
Mm-hmm.
"Okay. I also noticed that, erm, it was about three months ago that you picked up the prescription for your chronic inhaler."
Mm-hmm.
Do you have any difficulties with this?
"Well, I did some research on the chronic inhaler and I found out that there are steroids in it and that I don't want her to take steroids. I researched, er, some of the possible side effects and some of the health issues that can arise from taking steroids, and I-I just don't want her to take them at all. I don't want her to be exposed to them at all. And then, er, let me just get started and do it now. Er, because I'm sure it's coming, but I-I smoke. But I make sure I don't smoke around them so I make sure it doesn't affect them."
Okay.
-I want to let you know in a moment.
"Well, it sounds like you care a lot about Sarah. You don't want her on, er, steroids. You're worried about the impact this would have on her and you - you're working hard to keep your smoking away from her so it doesn't affect her asthma."
Mm-hmm.
"Okay. Er, would you mind if we talked a little bit about the chronic inhaler and the drug you're talking about, you know, the steroids, because, you know, I definitely don't want her to take a drug that contains steroids, like the ones you're worried about athletes. Er, can we just talk a little bit about it?"
Yes.
"Okay. Although, er, although this drug is not the drug it contains, it is in the same large family as the steroids you are concerned about, and these are called anabolic steroids."
Okay.
People build up and have masculinising effects.
Mm-hmm.
"If I could make an analogy, then a grape and a watermelon would be in the same family of fruits, you know, and of course the grape is much smaller than a watermelon. And if you eat a grape, you would be fine. If you eat a whole watermelon, it can make you very sick. If we look at the grape as the medicine your daughter is taking, then it's in the same big family, the amount of medication your daughter is getting is very small. Er, and not just that it's not an anabolic steroid, even though it's in the same big family. And what this drug actually causes is inflammation in your daughter's lungs. And - and it doesn't even get into her body. It just goes into her lungs. And as I said, I don't want your daughter to be a medi"
"Well, I don't think I knew they weren't the same as the anabolic steroids."
Mm-hmm.
"These are the ones that cause all the problems and everything. So, erm, if you can assure me that it won't have the same side effects and health problems."
"Yes, def-definitely not. I mean, you probably saw the name corticosteroid and thought, ""uh-oh."""
Yes.
"However, I would like to assure you that these are medicines that only get into their lungs and not into their bodies, and that they are not the same type of medicines that you are concerned about."
Okay.
Does it bother you if I talk to you a little bit about what your daughter's lungs are like when she has this inflammation and has to go to the emergency room?
Yes.
"Okay. If someone has asthma, his lungs are like hypersensitive. If I could use an analogy again, if you had burned the skin from the arm, if someone brushed against you before he burned the skin from the arm, it wouldn't bother you at all. But, if the skin from the arm is burned, you're literally reacting to it. Her lungs are extremely sensitive. Er, and how the skin on your arm would be if the skin had burned off. And what can this medicine do? This chronic inhaler reduces the inflammation in her lungs so that her lungs don't remain extremely sensitive, because otherwise everything in the air reacts like dust, pollen, er, with it, er, in a way that wouldn't normally affect us."
"Oh, okay."
And so this chronic inhaler can really prevent that. Okay? That's why it's so important to use it.
Mm-hmm.
"The other thing I wanted to tell you is that unfortunately, erm, even though you smoke outside and keep the smoke away from her, the smoke on your clothes, because her lungs are so sensitive, can also affect her lungs and cause her to react. Well, something I want you to think about is that if you use the chronic inhaler every day, she may not be sensitive to the smoke on your clothes, but she may be sensitive anyway, because her lungs are just very different from ours. Er, honestly, I would be happy if you would give up smoking for you too, because, as you know, it is not really good for you."
Yes.
"Er, and it would certainly help her. Er, but what I want is you to keep an eye on what happens when she uses the chronic inhaler, and if it still flares up when you are around her, if there is any, if there is smoke on your clothes because it can flare up."
"Oh, even if it's just my clothes?"
"Yes, yes."
She's so sensitive.
"She may not be using the chronic inhaler, erm, but you have to keep that in mind. Obviously, it would be best if it didn't come on your clothes, or if you stopped smoking."
"That's right. Um, so it would help um--you know, the thought of quitting smoking is a pretty daunting aspect."
Mm-hmm.
"I mean, I know people who have tried to quit and that's it - it's really hard, you know, so I know it would be better -"
"Very difficult. It is very relaxing,"
Yes.
And it's hard to replace it with anything.
"Yes, it is. Um."
"So, erm, any thoughts about what you can do to help at this point if you don't decide to quit right away?"
"Well, I thought, uh, if it concerns, you know, that it's on my clothes, if I just smoke while she was at school, and then change before she comes home. Would that help?"
"Oh, it sounds like it would be great if you could do that. Of course, you don't smoke in the house, you know - you know."
"Oh, absolutely. I never. Never."
"Um, yes. If you are willing to do that, it would certainly help."
Okay.
"Er, if you ever get to the point in the street where you're ready to stop, er, both for yourself and for them, we'd be happy to help you."
Yes. [giggles]
Okay.
It's really difficult.
So it sounds as if you are prepared to let them use the chronic inhalation.
Mm-hmm.
"- trying to get the inflammation under control so that she doesn't have to go to the emergency room and do everything you can to keep the smoke away from your clothes. And I think you're going to have big changes in terms of, er, they don't need to go to the emergency room, and you probably won't have to use the rescue inhaler much or not at all."
"Oh, really?"
"Yes, because you get that inflammation down."
"Oh, that's great."
Okay.
- because it is always scary when she has to use them.
Yes. So we go on and prepare these two recipes.
Okay.
"Use the chronic inhaler every day, hold the rescue inhaler around when she needs it. Er, and let's see how that works."
Okay.
Okay?
That sounds good. Thank you.
"Good, good."
"Hello, Sal. Thank you for coming in today."
No problem.
"I have seen that your doctor has made the referral and, er, I appreciate very much that you are taking the time to make this appointment."
"Yes, it's a bit awkward, I'd say, but I'm here."
So you made it here.
Mm-hmm.
- and do you have a feeling for what some of the concerns of the doctor were that led her to refer you?
"You know, smoking has changed, and now it's, you know, to cut back on drinking, get rid of those extra smokers, get rid of my dog. I don't know what else to do."
"So your asthma has increased and there is a lot of stuff, not just asthma?"
"Yes, there is a lot of stress, too. My wife is still on maternity leave, she's not getting paid, she's just with the baby, and I'm the only person working at the moment, and I also have to change all these things that are going on in my life."
Mm-hmm. Almost -
"Yes, that's a lot."
It sounds almost overwhelming.
"Yes, yes, it's overwhelming."
"Well, we have about 15 or 20 minutes together and I wonder if it would be okay if we took a few minutes and just looked at the different things going on for you, and maybe you could let me know what would be the most helpful time to spend some time on?"
"Yes, it just feels like everything is over the hill, but I think we have to start somewhere."
"Okay. Well, one of the things we use are these - it's kind of a worksheet and it's basically a worksheet for setting the agenda."
Mm-hmm.
"So if you were to list all the different things that people around you are saying you need to work or change, what would some of those things be? And, Sal, just because we write them down here doesn't mean you need to change them."
Okay.
"It really is - you are in the driver's seat, so you have to put all your cards on the table, so to speak."
"Okay. Um, okay, that sounds good. As long as I don't change anything and we're just kind of putting, er, I think pen on paper or something."
Yes.
"Er, okay, so my asthma."
"Okay, asthma is one of them."
Yes.
What else?
"Um, the fact that they want me to get rid of Oscar, that's my dog."
"So your dog, and - and the doctor says the dog is -"
"Well, he says yes, it's a major factor contributing to my asthma problems."
Okay.
"What I don't - I don't - I don't buy it and I can't just get rid of it, but it's something that's there."
It's quite shocking when you say you have to get rid of your dog.
Yes. The dog was there before my wife. I know I had it longer.
Hmm. So this is a huge stress at the moment?
"Yes. Yes, it is - it's a lot of stress, it's like my best friend, so that's one of the important things. Also, I guess I cut off the last cigarettes I've been working on."
"Okay, so smoking and - and I'm working towards quitting smoking - does it sound like a goal for you?"
"Um, finances are a problem at the moment."
"Okay, so money."
"Time, I had to come to all these appointments and take time off from work, which is obviously the money factor, isn't it?"
Right. Right. So the appointments and the time.
Mm-hmm.
"Um, and some of those things are kinda related, I think we're seeing them already."
"Yes, yes. Yes, there is something going on. And, erm, my drinking, I have to limit my drinking as well."
"Okay, wow. So a lot is happening right now, Sal. Anything else that concerns you?"
"No. It's just overwhelming when you see what they are, you know?"
"Right. Well, where would you start - I mean, if you had to pick somewhere one or two kinds of high priorities or things that we could talk about in our time?"
"I think - I think the thought of the dog definitely disturbed me, that was once."
Okay.
"And, erm, my asthma is out of control, too. So maybe those two."
"Okay, and these are pretty related ones."
Mm-hmm.
- sounds like. Okay.
"I understand that your asthma symptoms are simply out of control, so we need to look at some ways you can recover and not be back here."
"Mm-hmm. Yes, I definitely don't want to come back here. But, erm, the doctor said Oscar, my dog, is related to my asthma symptoms."
Yes.
The ridiculous part is I've had it for 12 years and now it's a problem.
"Well, you sound a little surprised, but I'm sure you've seen some of the material the clinic has given you about asthma symptoms and how to treat your asthma, and pets are a really big source of problems in that regard."
"Yes, but erm, let me just be clear, I have seen the materials, I have them."
Mm-hmm.
"-I have even read it. All I have done is take medicine, so I do not know so much about it."
"Well, erm, wait a minute, Sal, what do you mean by you-ha- When you know you're being informed - I'm just surprised because I understand from your chart that you have a young baby?"
Yes.
- a new baby.
"John Carlo, yes."
"- and you are very concerned about your health, you want to be there for your baby and that you have already taken some steps, you have almost given up smoking -"
Mm-hmm.
"I know it will be difficult to do that, but there are always people who will adopt animals. I am sure you have friends or family members."
"Erm, that's a bit too much for me now. First of all, John Carlo is being cared for. That's fine. He doesn't have asthma from the dog. That's just me."
"You're the one I'm worried about, Sal. You're the one I'm worried about, okay? The symptoms are worse. You've had two or three severe asthma attacks. And - and you know how - that's, er, a life risk that there are some adults with severe asthma who can actually die from their symptoms? It's really something that needs to be taken very, very seriously. I can't emphasize that enough."
"So, Oscar is going to let me die? He hasn't let me die in 12 years, and the doctor says, ""Oh, I don't know if it's the stress, the finances, the drinking."" So what do we do when we say Oscar could let me die? I've had him for 12 years."
"Sal, what, er, do you understand that your asthma, what happened 6 or 10 years ago, is getting worse and worse? You know very well that the buffers, the strength of the medications are getting higher and higher, and there is only so much that can be done with medications alone. You know that."
"Well, they can continue to give me more medication and give me the strongest, and I'll keep Oscar."
"Sal, you are almost the strongest. And if Oscar is so important to you, then you put Oscar higher than your baby, than your wife? Like, er, that doesn't make sense to me. Do you understand how important that is?"
"I understand, but I don't think you understand my situation. I've had this dog for 12 years, so I'm not going to just get up and get him out of my house if I don't even know if that's the main thing."
"Er, okay, well."
Barbara Roberts?
Yes.
Hi there.
Hello.
"My name is Dr. Betty. I am one of the new family doctors in the practice. First of all, what would you call yourself?"
"Well, you can call me Barbara, that's fine. Thank you."
"Okay, that's fine. Okay. So, Barbara, I see you today, um, but I think it's usually Dr. Brown who sees you, right?"
"Yes, Dr Brown is my doctor."
Okay. What made you see me today?
"I have terrible problems with my stomach and, erm, Dr. Brown just doesn't seem to be able to get to the bottom of it. And I thought maybe, erm, I would come to you to see if you could help."
Okay. Can you tell me a bit more about your abdominal problems?
"I, uh, uh, I oscillate between constipation and diarrhea. Uh, sometimes I have something like convulsions, and sometimes it stings. It's a real stinging feeling. Uh, I often have the urge to go to the toilet and, uh, and I pass very smelly winds."
Good. So there are a lot of symptoms.
""
- and some of them sounded -
Yes.
- rather annoying for you.
Yes.
Okay. And how long has this been around?
"Well, I, uh, I put it down to a vacation I had about four years ago in Egypt. I had, uh, a terrible bout of illness and diarrhoea, and, uh, and I don't think my stomach has ever been right since."
Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. So do you think it started about four years ago after that holiday?
"Yes, yes."
Okay. And what treatments have you tried for this?
"Well, uh, Dr. Brown gave me some muscle relaxants in the beginning."
Mm-hmm.
"Um, but I was in the health shop and - and they were really helpful. They gave me a lot of different, er, tablets and medicines."
Correct.
"- for different things. Um, no, oh, and Immodium."
Correct.
"I have Immodium in my handbag all the time, just in case. Yes."
"Correct. So, these different tablets that you can take from the"
Hmm.
- the herb shop -
Hmm.
- how do you take them?
"Oh yes, different tablets, you know, I don't have the same problem every day."
Correct.
"- so I take a few tablets with me, erm, symptoms, and"
Correct.
- other tablets for other things.
So am I right in thinking that you may be opting for everyday life?
Hmm.
- what you take with you
Hmm.
- Depending on what your stomach is doing?
Yes.
Okay. Okay. And what about the tests? Did you have tests for these problems?
"Yes, er, I had, er, gastrogas in the early days - what are they called?"
A gastric colonoscopy.
That's it.
You pulled the hose from top to bottom?
"Yes, yes."
Okay.
"Um, and at the same time I had a barium enema."
Correct.
It was very uncomfortable.
Okay.
"Um, but um, no, I tried it - well, I don't think he tried enough tests because he said afterwards that they didn't find anything."
Correct.
-and he-is-he-just didn't send me off anymore. That's it now -
Correct.
- as for him. Send me back to the doctor.
Right. It sounds as if you are not happy with it.
"Well, you know, I think the NHS is actually running out of money, right?"
Correct.
- decided that I had enough tests.
Correct.
"And, erm, you know, when you go on the Internet -"
Mm-hmm.
- there are plenty of tests he could have sent me to.
Correct.
"Er, if I had a bit more money I would go private."
Correct.
I just don't think he got to the bottom of it.
Right. So you feel that not enough has actually been done to carry out tests?
"No, he isn't. There's a lot more he could do. I'm sure."
s right. Okay. It sounds as if you have had these problems for about four years now.
""
You have a lot of different symptoms in your stomach.
""
"Um, you've tried a lot of tablets."
""
"- and you have carried out some investigations, but you are not entirely happy about this - that you have not been investigated thoroughly enough."
Yes.
Is that it?
I would say yes.
- if I understood the story correctly.
Yes.
"Okay. And may I ask you, Barbara, how all this affects you day by day? How does it affect your life?"
"Er, well, it had quite a big impact. Er, I mean, the first thing, the biggest thing I guess, is that I-I switched from full-time to part-time."
Mm-hmm.
I just couldn't sit comfortably all day.
Correct.
"Um, so I went part-time, but in the end, I, uh, about a year ago, I stopped working altogether."
Right. Right.
"Um, I miss that."
Correct.
I miss the girls. We used to go out at least once a week.
Correct.
"To the pictures or for a drink, that's one thing."
Sounds like you liked it.
"Yes, yes. Yes, we always laughed."
Right. Okay.
"Um, I used to go to Swing and Shape."
Mm-hmm.
"It was, uh, once a week, but you know, it was that I didn't feel comfortable, I never felt right to do all these exercises. I was always afraid that I would fall short, so I stopped."
Correct.
"Um, then -- Well, my husband and I went out to dinner."
Mm-hmm.
We don't do that any more.
Correct.
"Um, mm. Yes, that's a lot."
"Yes, it sounds as if your life has really changed in recent years."
""
- quite a lot because of these symptoms.
Yes.
It sounds - it sounds like you are reviewing the things you used to do.
""
Correct.
""
So what is it that you would spend your average day doing?
"Well, I potter around the house."
Mm-hmm.
"- Um, I may spend a little too much time watching TV. I am a little dependent on daytime TV, I have to say."
Mm-hmm.
"Er, they attract you, don't they?"
They certainly do.
"Um, I read a bitter message."
Mm-hmm.
"- the old magazines, but, er, in general I am at home."
Correct.
Yes.
"Okay. Okay. And have there been times in the last four years when you have noticed significant changes in your symptoms? For example, were there times when things were better for you?"
"Er, well, last year, um, my son got married."
Correct.
"- and I have to say, I was afraid that I would, um, not cope with it."
Mm-hmm.
"That I wasn't feeling good enough, but surprising enough, um, I was in good shape, and I think it was about three weeks in the summer to prepare for that."
Mm-hmm.
- and the whole hoo-ha of the wedding.
Mm-hmm.
But I was good for it - in really good shape. Yes.
Correct.
That was a good time.
Correct. And what were your gut symptoms at that time?
I barely noticed them.
Right. Okay.
"Yes, it seemed, er, it seemed, er, clarifying."
Right. Right.
Which was good.
"Right, that's interesting."
""
And are there times when your abdominal discomfort bothers you more? Looks especially bad?
"Er, well, I am - I have a bit of a bad patch at the moment."
Correct.
"It's especially, er, uncomfortable. Er, I have to say, I notice it when my husband is gone."
Correct.
- he travels with his job and
Correct.
- may be away a few times a month.
Er-huh.
"Um, and it's not - it's not good very often, I have to say."
Right. So you realize it's a bit worse when your husband isn't there? Okay.
"Mm. Maybe I think a little more about it, I don't know when he's not there."
"Right, I know you've seen Dr Brown on this in recent years."
""
What does he say he thinks you might be wrong?
"Well, he thinks it's all in my head."
Correct.
"You know, he says it's stress."
Right. Okay.
""
And what do you think?
"Well, I mean, it can't all be in my head. I get too much physical pain."
Correct.
"- so that it is in my head. I mean, it is real. It is real pain."
Mm-hmm.
Um -
And have you thought about what you think might be the cause of this?
"Well, I mean, I thought it was maybe an infection that hadn't cleared up."
Mm-hmm.
"- in the early stages, but, uh, I think, uh, I mean, sometimes I think it's IBS. A friend of mine has that and it sounds similar, and then"
Correct.
"- Another time I think: ""I wonder if it is an ulcer."""
Correct.
"Um, on a really bad day I start to think it could be cancer."
Correct.
"Um, my mother-in-law - my mother-in-law died of cancer last year and she had a, er, growth that"
Mm-hmm.
- the doctor did not examine.
Correct.
"But when they found it, it was as big as a football field."
Oh dear.
- and it was - it was too late to run it.
Right. Right.
"You know, when I go to bed at night now, erm, I just feel like making sure nothing else is going on."
Correct.
"And, er, yes, I do worry about that."
"So you are some kind of incentive, have a feeling at night?"
"Oh, yes."
To see if you can feel anything?
Yes.
Correct.
"I just want to make sure nothing changes down there, you know?"
Right. Okay.
""
"Okay, so to make sure I got the story right, you've been seeing Dr. Brown for a couple of years."
""
They have tried a variety of medications.
""
"- some prescribed, some not."
""
- from the herb shop. None of them really made a big difference.
Mm-hmm.
"- but you may feel that you have not done enough research, and sometimes you worry that it is something as serious as a"
""
- a cancer. Is that - did I get it?
Yes.
- History right?
"Yes, yes."
Okay.
I would say that.
"Okay. Barbara, what did you hope for today?"
"Well, I thought, you know, you're a new doctor here."
Mm-hmm.
- and you have just completed your medical training. I wondered if you could see the problem with new eyes and a new perspective.
Correct.
"- Um, you probably know about different tests, new tests that my doctor does not know, new developments."
Correct.
So maybe you could send me for some other tests.
Right. Right. So you were hoping that I would send you for further tests?
""
Okay.
"Well, I think there has to be something that makes a test powerful."
Correct.
- could reveal.
"Well, I think Barbara, after hearing your story and hearing about the symptoms, I'm not sure that sending you now for further tests that we could do for you would be the most useful thing, and the reason for that is that you - you've had some of the most important tests over the last few years, and they haven't shown anything, and your symptoms haven't really changed that much, so it's very unlikely that we would send you for further tests now - that they would show something different than we already know. So please -- I think it would be a waste of time if you did more tests."
"So, so, do you think it's all in my head? You're going to be like Dr. Brown. You think I'm imagining it all?"
"Er, no. I think that you are clearly in pain, and that you clearly have a lot of physical symptoms, and they are clearly getting in the way."
""
-Your life and cause a lottery
""
- disability.
""
I guess - I think the way I think about these things is that they're not necessarily all in the mind or all in the body.
""
"Sometimes these things can go together. Er, I think I remember how you told me the last year when your son got married, er, and you were very busy."
""
- and quite happy that the symptoms have somehow lessened.
""
"And, erm, if your husband is gone, which you don't particularly like, your symptoms will sometimes seem somehow greater. So, I guess what I'm wondering, Barbara, is whether there might be some kind of connection with you between how you feel in your mind and what's going on in your life, and - how much your symptoms worry you. Do you think that's a possibility?"
t realize that my mind can cause so much pain.
"Mm. I'm not saying that the pain is in your head. Um, I guess what I'm saying is that sometimes the way we feel and the way our life goes can affect how we perceive our symptoms."
No.
- I think I wonder whether it would be a good idea now to try a different approach to your problems.
What approach?
"Well, I think when I think a little bit about those other areas of your life, er, I think about the fact that your life has really changed in the last four years. It really seems to have shrunk."
""
And it sounds like you're not doing many of the things you used to do.
No.
- used to have joy. Is that true?
"Well, I just can't."
Yes.
I can't do it anymore.
"Yes. And I think I'm wondering -- Er, it sounds like you gave up on these things because you felt you couldn't do them, but I wonder if what happened in a funny way, the fact that you're not doing these pleasant things now, has somehow penetrated into you."
""
- dissatisfied with the way in which your life is at the moment. And - and I think I wonder if this can make your symptoms worse.
"Oh, I don't know."
""
I don't know.
"Well, I think what I would ask is if one of the approaches we have to take now is to think about what you do with your life and what you do with your day, and maybe try to bring back some of those pleasant things, you know, even if it's just a meeting."
""
"- once a week with your girlfriends, and whether it is even possible to do such things."
""
- Improving the quality of life. I am also thinking of the tablets you take.
Mm-hmm.
"And the fact that you - you seem to take quite a lot of them, and I wonder if it's worth sitting and looking at them and maybe trying to rationalize them a little bit and really decide which ones help you, which ones do nothing and which might even worsen some of your symptoms, I think."
Hmm.
"What would you make of trying this slightly different approach for about two or three months, just to see if it makes a difference or not?"
"Well, two or three months is a long time when something is going on. I mean, it happened to my mother-in-law, you know."
Correct.
They - they left them and -
Mm-hmm.
- did not recognize it and -
"Well, I guess if - if we decided to work together like this -"
Mm-hmm.
"- With this new approach I would see you regularly, we can keep an eye on your symptoms and if they change, we can investigate them if necessary."
""
- pretty clear that nothing new is happening that we are missing.
""
What would that sound like?
"So, erm, what do you say then? That I should come back and see you?"
I think that would be a good idea. I think we have only just started talking about it.
""
"- and I think you might need a bit of time to think about it and then maybe come back. Maybe, if you are booked for a double space next week, and that would give us a good bit of time to think about this new approach."
Mm-hmm.
"And if you could maybe bring your tablets or make a list of them, we could look at what you take and maybe go from there. What would that sound like, Barbara?"
"Okay. Well, uh, to make an appointment for next week."
Yes.
And come and see you again -
Yes.
- and talk a bit more about it?
"Yes, I think so."
Okay.
I think that would be a good start - a good start.
And I make a list of the tablets I take.
Yes.
I don't bring all the bottles down.
"Okay, all right."
Okay. All right. I will do that.
So should I see you again next week?
I will make an appointment for next week. Yes.
"Okay. All right. Thank you, Barbara."
"Okay, thank you."
Goodbye.
"In summary, the Minnesota State, Mankato Safety Report states that you were stopped on Stadium Road last Friday for driving under the influence of alcohol and then transported for detoxification. Also, you are only 21 years old. Is the report correct?"
"I-I guess, er, I don't really remember much. I like it that it was a week ago, so I was kind of drunk."
"Okay. Such behaviour could suspend you, is it not a matter of concern to you?"
"Hmm. I mean, not really. I'm going to be 21 in a few months. Um, as soon as I turn 21, the cops can't give me a minor and I mean, I'm not a heavy drinker like my friends or something like that. I'm not wasting myself at all. And, erm, I just have to be careful. I just don't get caught. I'm just trying to be like a normal college student."
"What did you think when you got in your car after six beers, you could have caused an accident and killed someone."
"I called my roommate for a ride. He was sleepy, so I kind of had to go home. And that's not even my fault. I give him rides all the time, but I haven't done anything."
"If you continue to celebrate like this, your problems will only get worse. You will probably face expensive legal citations, poor grades and health problems. Get out of school and disappoint your parents. You don't want that to happen, do you?"
"No, no. As I said, it's not even my fault. How, are we done here? I have lessons in 15 minutes."
"Your behavior is not what Minnesota State University expects of its students. If you want to be a student here, you need to show that you are able to follow our rules. Do you think you can do that, or else you will be suspended?"
"Look, I like to go to the [incomprehensible 00: 02: 29] and I understand what you're saying. You, you're making some really good points and I'm going to think about it. Okay?"
"Okay. Well, your sanction is that you will be sentenced to a university suspended sentence and you will have to attend an alcohol education seminar that will cost you $150. Moreover, disciplinary action is progressive and cumulative, meaning that further violations are associated with a suspension of one semester or more."
"$150, are you serious? I can't pay that. Well, I'm through with that."
"Hello, Mike. I'm Kathy. I'm glad you're coming in today."
"Hi Kathy, nice to meet you."
"I'm sure there are so many other places you'd rather be than talking to me today, but, er, you're here, and, er, thank you."
Okay.
"Um, I wanted to ask you first how you are physically. Um, I want to make sure you're okay when you're feeling okay. And, er, because your safety is of, er, paramount importance."
Sure.
-Will it be okay?
"Yes, absolutely."
"-um, we-we're--you're probably here because of your speeding ticket. That's what I've collected."
"Yes. I got a DUI, and I sped up, er, during the DUI, obviously."
"Oh. Oh, okay. So, um, around that, erm, do you ever feel - you feel bad or sick when you're there?"
"No, I'm fine."
"Okay, well. I just wanted to make sure that, er, er, and, er, if the last time you drank was -"
The night of the DUI is the last time I drank.
"Er-huh, yes."
"And then, you know, erm, I think I'm here because my lawyer wants me to undergo an evaluation."
Sure.
"-erm, with you, and, erm, I'm really not sure what it means or anything like that, but, erm, he said I should come here and, erm, just tell the truth is what he told me."
"Oh, okay, I appreciate that."
Yes.
"Um, and if there is any information you need from me, please, er, ask yourself. Um, the reason he asked you to come in was because of the blood alcohol level of 2.8."
Okay.
"So, erm, that was legally over the limit you were supposed to drive."
"Is it bad, or is it high?"
"Well, it's high, uh, you know, they--"
Okay.
For driving.
Okay
"And so, uh, the officer at the scene, uh, when you blew the 2.8, he did that -- he-- there was a problem."
"Yes. He freaked out, well, out."
"Was he freaking out? Yes, yes."
"I think he was exaggerating a little bit, but you know what."
"Right. So, uh, I'll just ask you a few questions, uh, if you don't mind, about your drinking. And - and - and - so, uh, you said that the couple was the last time you drank two weeks ago?"
Yes.
"Yes. Okay. And, erm, what did you drink that night and how much?"
"Er, my boyfriend had a, um - a get together, because it was birthday party in, er, downtown, and, er, you know, it's not like it was a normal thing, but, er, I drank too much that night. You know, I just, er - and I used bad judgment. I shouldn't have driven that night."
"Yes. Er, it was me - maybe you could tell me how much you drank."
"Um, I don't really remember. I know, uh, I don't know, I probably had five or six drinks, I would think something like that."
"Mm-hmm. Five, six drinks, eh?"
"Um, yeah, they were a bit bigger. I don't really know - I didn't really count, so I don't really know."
"Oh, okay, so I might have five or six guests."
"Five or six, that sort of thing."
"Um, yeah. And-and, w-what were the drinks?"
"Um, absolute vodka."
Hmm.
- and seven out. Yes.
"Oh, okay. So, uh, you said it was pretty much just five or six. Do you understand -- how often do you use that? And you said it wasn't."
Yes.
- not a normal occasion for you to drink so much?
"Usually I drink one or two, and that's like, you know, I did that, uh - you know, I felt a little drunk when I was - you know, when I was drinking, I just used, uh, bad judgment. I really shouldn't have been driving."
"Right. Yes. Um, so you don't usually drink that much. Um, on average, maybe a week, how much would you say you drink?"
"Um, sometimes I drink, uh, you know, maybe one or two, and then I don't drink for a while, you know. So it's not really one - there's not really a pattern."
Uh-huh
"-You know, it's not really like an ah- it's not a habit, you know,"
Correct.
"I-I don't know if I would consider myself an alcoholic. You know, I just know, uh, uh, you know, it was bad judgment."
"Right, so it doesn't get in your way."
Oh no.
- every day.
Absolutely not. Mm-mm.
"Right. Oh, that's good."
Yes.
"So, erm, if you look back, Mike, erm, when did you start to think that if you were drinking alcohol, most of your life?"
"Um, there really was no time I don't know. I-I don't really understand the question. I mean, there really wasn't - I don't really drink on a normal basis, so I don't know - [Crosstalk]"
"So is that - that's a complete, er - a question that even applies?"
Yes.
Okay.
Yes.
That's fine.
Yes.
"That's fine. Okay. Um, so what about the, er - the first DUI, could you tell me a little bit about it? This was your second?"
Yes.
And that's why I asked you earlier in your life if that was not the case.
"It seems that every time I drink, er, more than a few drinks, I get into trouble, and the two times I did, I got into trouble both times. [Crosstalk]"
It was those two times. Yes.
"Yeah, pretty. I mean, it sounds weird, I know, but, uh--"
That sounds like bad luck.
"Yes. In fact, that has followed me - that has followed me pretty much my whole life, the bad luck of what has happened."
Yes.
But alcohol doesn't really have that.
"Oh, okay."
Yes.
But that bad luck?
Yes.
Yes. Does alcohol go hand in hand with bad luck or right?
Yes. It certainly seems so. Yes. It certainly seems so.
"Yes. Oh, okay. Yes, what about that? The--Are there other incidents that might occur to you that it seems, er, er, alcohol was there, and then your luck just took a turn, or it was just those two times?"
"Um, you know, I don't really know, um--I don't really, erm, get into a situation where I-I-I-drink too much. Um, you know, I-I realize it's my second DUI, but, erm, erm-uh, it's not something that, erm, like a normal everyday process for me."
Mm-hmm.
"Um, you know, usually when I drink, I drink one or two drinks and then I stop. Um, so it's not like, um -- you know, it's not like it's something that's become a problem in my life, you know."
"Oh, good. Oh, good. And so, where do you usually drink, er, your drinks? Is it at home or, er, outside, after work, social drinking?"
"Um, it's usually social."
Mm-hmm.
"Yes. It's usually social. It would be, you know, maybe at events or something like that is usually when I would, um, maybe drink more than one or two."
Mm-hmm.
"I probably should just call a taxi or something, you know. I wouldn't have this problem."
Would that help?
"Um, probably, I think that would help. I think that would be something I should work on, er - I should work on it."
"So it sounds as if you've already thought about, er, how to get around safely."
"Yes. Yes, or I can just stay at home. If I was drinking, I probably could stay at home, so I wouldn't have any problems."
You have thought about it a lot.
"Yes, a bit."
"Yes, good."
"Yes, obviously, because I just don't do it - you know, I don't like getting into trouble, and I don't, er."
Trouble is no fun.
Yes.
No.
Yes.
"Yes. So tell me a bit more about it, erm, if you five - if you find yourself and then this - thought comes to do something else than get in the car, that comes and goes, or - or do you think - is that something you could do next time?"
"Um, oh, I will never get in the car again if I drink again. Yes, I would never do that again."
This what-what-was-different?
"Er, I don't want to lose my licence, you know."
Hmm.
"I don't, er, you know, I don't want to lose my license."
Wow. You need your license.
Yes.
-to move around. You need your license to work.
"Well, and then I also sell cars for a living, so --"
Oh.
"-Um, that would be, um -- you know, I don't want to lose my job either. You know, I think it would be connected somehow."
Mm-hmm.
"And you know, me - you're not going to call my work or anything for that, are you?"
No.
"Oh, okay."
"No, no."
All right.
"It's all in your hands, er, to have that."
Okay. I just didn't know how it works.
Oh no.
"Because I think if they found out, I might be in danger of losing my job."
"Well, you're here. And - and I've got you, uh-uh, you've got to be credited with that. It took a lot to get in today and, uh, if, uh, if someone actually speaks for themselves, what I-I hear you say, uh, call a taxi or stay home."
Yes.
So what does it look like for you to stay at home? Is that something you - you know - talked about drinking at an event? Would you stay at home?
"Well, you know, the Super Bowl is just around the corner, and this could be an opportunity where I might see myself drinking that day."
Mm-hmm.
"So, maybe I would just do it, erm - I think I just let people come to my house instead of going somewhere else, you know."
Would that work for you?
"Yes, I think so, and that's probably a wiser thing. I don't want to go through that again, you know."
"Yes, yes."
Yes.
"Er, er, would people come and drink at your house, and then they'd be fine?"
I think so.
Yes.
Sure.
Yes.
Yes.
"So, an event at your home."
""
"Yes, well. That sounds good. Mike, has there ever been a time in your life when you thought about, er, not drinking at all?"
"When I had my first DUI, I didn't drink at all for about six months. And, uh, I-I just didn't think that, uh, I really had a problem with it, so you know, I-I started drinking again. But, you know, it wasn't uh - you know, it was a little different last time because I drank a little more last time than I do now. I don't really drink as much as I used to, you know, uh, and after you know, I stopped for six months, so I kind of knew I didn't have a problem."
Right. Six months. That's a long time.
Yes.
How have these six months been for you?
"Um, I know it was kind of weird. My friends didn't really hang out with me much."
Friends?
"Yes. You know, I, er."
"What? If you don't mind asking what friends they were? I don't want to get too personal, but the friends who usually drank with you or only with you."
"No, my friends."
-social circles. Okay.
"Just my social circle, I think, um --"
"Wha-wha-what do you think she did, n-not hang out with you?"
"Probably ""because I didn't"" - I didn't drink with them, I think. I don't really know. I mean, it seemed, um --"
Did you ask them?
"Um, no. I really couldn't because my girlfriend really wouldn't let me hang out with them. You know? I mean, it was, um -- She said if I continued hanging out with them, you know, she wouldn't be with me anymore, and I just thought it would be better for me to calm down a little bit and, er, maybe it would be better with us, you know."
And your girlfriend is important to you.
Sure.
- and this relationship was important to you.
"Well, it was until she left, you know."
"It was important then, yes."
Yes.
Why would she leave?
"Er, she left when I started drinking again."
"Oh, after the six months."
"After the six months she said, uh - you know, it's kind of, I don't know, she just said it wasn't going to work out and, uh, she decided not to continue the relationship."
"Oh, okay. So-so, er, you started drinking again, and then she left?"
"Er, it was about the same time. I really don't know which one came first. It was about the same time. Er, we got a lot of arguments. I just didn't feel right. You know, I-I-I-wasn't - my friends weren't there. I, uh - you know, I missed going out with them."
Did you feel isolated?
"Yeah. It was kind of weird because I felt like she was trying to control me, and, uh - and uh, you know, me, uh - and she was telling me all the time what to do, and I just didn't feel right in the whole situation, so it was pretty much like, we both decided, you know, it just wasn't the right thing to do, so."
And so you're an independent guy.
Sure.
- and no one will tell you what to do.
"Well, I guess. Sure. Yes."
"Yes. So, have you, er - then you started drinking again, and that was - if you could just give me somehow a small time frame for how long ago that is, that these six months were completed -"
"The first was, er, three years ago, and then, er, this one was a few weeks ago, so, er, it's been a couple of years, you know."
"Yes, absolutely."
Yes. A few years have passed.
"So, in what way has, er, drunk, er, somehow, er - what's the good thing about drinking for those few years, and then maybe not so good?"
"I just drink to be social, you know, I don't know that it really changes anything about me. It's just, uh - you know, I drink just to be social, you know."
Mm-hmm. And the friends who didn't hang around with you have come back?
"Yes, absolutely. Yes. As soon as my girlfriend left, I could go out with them again, you know. [Laughter]"
Didn't you get on with your girlfriend?
"Well, she didn't want me to go out with them."
Yes.
She thought that she really -
She was separated from your other friends at the time and
Yes.
- these relationships just did not come together?
"She blamed the first DUI. She said, you know, because I was out with them, it was quite a lot, you know, they made me drink too much that night."
And what do you think?
"I think she was right. Yes, absolutely."
"So, you -"
"I mean, if they hadn't given me those shots, you know, toward the end of the night, I would have been fine. You know, I could have driven, and I wouldn't have done it, uh - I wouldn't have hit that mailbox."
It would have been nice if they hadn't done that - if they hadn't given you those shots.
Yes.
"Oh yes, the letterbox, where did that come in?"
""
-first DUI you get.
"Yes. I was there - it was like I was a few blocks from the house and I, er, rolled onto the neighbor's lawn and took out her mailbox."
That must have been scary.
I don't really remember much of that night.
"Oh, that was blackout?"
"Er, I don't know if I was blackened, but I just don't remember much about it."
Correct.
I wouldn't really call it a blackout.
"Oh, okay."
-Remember how that happened.
I am sorry. I did not want to assume that
Yes.
- that was blackout - forgive me.
Yes. Yes. Everything is fine.
"Um, so it was kind of like that girlfriend--Your girlfriend, I don't know, well, her name. Um, your girlfriend decided -- The mailbox and her."
"Yes, Mary-Mary, just [paraphrase] Well, after I got the mail -- after I hit the mailbox --"
Mm-hmm.
"-Um, I stopped drinking, you know, for about six months, and, uh, you know, and we tried to fix things, but it just didn't work out."
Yes.
- it just didn't work.
Oh.
I think at that point she became a bit too possessive.
"Yes. You felt that she was the only person you had in your life, needed your friends and -"
"Um, I think she just wanted to control me and I was tired of being controlled."
"No one wants to be controlled, er, yeah. Yes. Er, and in what way, well, do you feel like you were controlled by your friends at all times? You said they made you drink those shots. It sounded like you were maybe feeling a little controlled? But -- [Crosstalk]"
"No, I was - they were right - no, they weren't - they didn't really control me. They were right - they shouldn't have given me the last few shots, ""because they knew I was pretty, you know, uh, everything was messed up before."
Yes.
"-You know that when they - when they - you know when they gave me the last, you know, a few shots, that kind of brought me over the edge."
"Right, they weren't looking for your best interests at that point."
"Pretty much, pretty much."
And then sent you off by car.
"Yes. I mean, I guess it was my decision to do the other recordings, uh - you know, but I - I don't know. I really don't remember too much."
It's a throwback again.
Yes.
Yes.
"Yes. You can blame it a bit afterwards. I mean, it works for me. [Laughter]"
"Looking back? Oh, yes, they will - it will - they will take the blame. Um, so you're still standing -- Do you still have, er, you know, you started drinking again, and then, erm, the second DUI, what? Is it the same circle of social circles, the same friends?"
Yes. [Crosstalk]
Same kind of situation. [Crosstalk]
"I mean, they've been my friends since high school, you know, er, since high school."
So they are important to you?
Absolutely.
"Mm-hmm. Yes. And sometimes, erm, people have friends who are friends, but then there are friends who stay in our lives and are constant."
Absolutely.
"Yeah, okay."
Yes.
"Have you ever had, er, interest outside, er, the social drinking, the friends, er, like, what do you do when you're not with them?"
"Er, well, just like I'm going to do stuff around the house, you know, uh, mow the grass and stop doing work on the yard, otherwise, uh, I don't know."
"Yes. And any other relationship, if you don't mind asking me -- [Crosstalk]"
"Er, no, I'm single now, so you know, I don't really know, uh -- [crosstalk]"
How does it work?
"It's all fine, you know, I'm dating a little bit, but, uh, you know, I just don't want to get serious right now."
"Oh, what - how serious does it look now? Um--"
"Um, I just don't want to date someone regularly. I don't really feel like I want to be in a committed relationship."
"Yes. That's fine, yes. That's good. It sounds like you know yourself pretty well."
Absolutely.
"Okay. Right. So, erm, now that we're looking at - erm, your second DUI and, erm - well, Mike, if you don't mind asking me, what would you do differently now, erm - erm, now?"
"Well, I think I really want to think about it."
That's when the court sent you and we kind of have to figure out what would happen if you go out and do it again.
"Yeah. Well, I mean I-me, er-me, er-I wouldn't drink that much, and if I did, I would call, er, a taxi or, er, you know, get some kind of ride home, I think, ""cause, er, you know, I just don't want to get into trouble, you know."
Yes. Is there anyone you could call?
"Er, I don't really think about it. I think I would have to think about it, because if I went out and had a drink, I would have to think about it. Yes."
Correct.
"I think I could call it taxi rank or something, I don't know."
They will come.
Yes. I think it will be something.
"Yes. They will come. As long as you have the money, they will come and get you. Yes."
"Yes. I think if I take some money, I might put it in my wallet."
Yes.
"- and I like to put it in for emergencies, so I have money. If I'm drunk, I can just call a taxi, and I use that money to get home."
"Oh, so if you were using your cash, would it be elsewhere?"
What is this?
"Your cash would be elsewhere, not in your wallet?"
"Probably in my front pocket, I guess."
"Okay, yeah. So, yeah."
Yes.
That makes a lot of sense. Then you would have hidden your money somewhere else.
"Yes. Well, if I, er - if I put it away, I still wouldn't spend it, you know, [incomprehensible 00: 18: 48] have it."
Mm-hmm.
There is a plan that I would have to implement.
Sounds like a good plan.
-to come home. Yes.
"Yes. So, erm, how often do you think you need this plan in you?"
"It would probably be my wallet for a while, I would think, ""because I - like I said, I don't really think I have a problem with, er - drinking, you know."
Correct.
"- Think that, as you know, it was an isolated incident."
Mm-hmm.
"And - and I, uh - you know, I just, uh -"
"And then - yeah, and then you said, if you want people, uh, you drink for the Super Bowl. Was it the Super Bowl?"
Yes.
"I'm sorry, I'm not a football fan, but the Super Bowl is coming up, right?"
"Yeah, well, you've got to have a few people at the Super Bowl, you know."
"So, you'd have them in there and, um, I'm just curious about the people leaving your house, would you worry about them, there would be a taxi."
"But I don't really hang out with people who really drink a lot. I mean, they are - they don't like each other - I wouldn't call them drunk, so, I mean, they can, you know, they can handle it."
So it's up to them?
"Sure, I'd think so."
Mm-hmm.
Yes.
"It sounds as if you have - you have thought about it, and you are ready to do a few things that - the wallet, er, money in your wallet and - and for the taxi,"
Yes.
"Do you have people who want to socialize for an event, and that you still have your friends and core group - and, er, be careful. What were the six months in which you didn't drink? If you would decide not to drink."
"You know, it was a - it was, uh - it was pretty good. I just didn't feel like I had my friends around me, and it kind of seemed boring. I mean, I felt good physically and, uh, you know, me, uh - I was more punctual to work, I was doing really good work and so on, uh, but, you know, it was just, uh - the hard part for me was that I just didn't have any friends around me. I just kind of felt - I felt isolated. I just didn't feel comfortable, you know."
"Six months is a long time. There was, um -- Try to think back, were there other people? Was it - was it just you?"
"Well, my-my-girlfriend-my girlfriend and I tried to figure it out, but it just seemed like we were arguing all the time, you know. It just didn't seem to like - you know what I mean? Like the non-drinking part was good, but it just didn't seem like anything had changed."
All right.
You know.
If you didn't - if you had a plan to maybe not drink the one you mentioned -
Yes.
"-um, er, your friend Mary is not part of your life -"
No.
-right now.
- and I really do not see that it works very well.
"Is there anything else that, um, somehow, er, would fill that - the Friends area, you think?"
"Well, I don't know. I mean, it's a - I mean, my friends drink anyway. So, it's kind of difficult - it's kind of difficult to be with them, and then - if I don't drink because it's like that - I just don't feel like I fit in, you know."
"But, yeah, I understand what you're saying, for sure. Er, there are those friends who drink, but they don't drink as much, I heard you say."
"Yes, they don't drink that much, but they - they seem to - you know how they drink, you know."
Mm.
"I mean, it's just beer."
Correct.
-It's not like they drink whisky or something.
Yes.
"You know, but they're going to drink beer, and that's right - you know, for me I don't know. Sometimes, erm, I don't know - you know, I intend to have a few drinks, and maybe, you know, I'm going to have more than a couple, you know -"
Mm-hmm.
"- and then I don't know what a legal limit really is. So, I think I can drink something? Like two or three drinks an hour, is that what it is?"
"Um, that's one drink an hour."
"One drink an hour, okay."
Mm-hmm.
I have to remember that. [laughs]
Or a shot or two.
"Yes, a shot."
-a glass of wine or beer.
Okay.
""
But just one?
Mm-hmm.
That's it.
"Yes. Er, the, er - the idea of, er, having friends and not drinking, is this something that would even, er, be a reality?"
"Yes, I guess. I-I think I probably know a few friends who don't drink and I don't really, er, probably -"
Who are they then - who-who-are they?
"I don't really have many good friends. You know, I have some acquaintances who don't drink, they drink."
Would they?
- Pretty much everyone I know likes to drink.
"Yeah, what do you think, what would that do to the relationship, that you don't drink, but you're still with these people - these friends?"
"Yes, me, uh--"
Would it work and --
"t know. But, it's strange, I-I believe that, you know, somehow, when I go there, you know, and - and I'm connected to them at all, it's, uh - you know, we - you know -"
It's uncomfortable.
"Yes, exactly."
What makes it uncomfortable?
"Well, ""because they drink and then - and when I drink lemonade, they screw me up a bit."
So how about riding around with you?
"Well, they just rant with me until I get to know them - you know, until I have a beer with them, you know."
"Oh, and - Oh, I see, yes."
"You know, I mean, right."
"Yes, like a kind -"
"- They are just like goading me, I don't know."
"Oh, yes, yes."
"You know, I really don't feel like being an outcast, you know what I mean, they're my friends, you know."
"Right, so do it -"
"I've been with them since, you know, like in high school, so I can't do that."
"Mm-hmm, and -"
They mean a lot to me.
"- it is [incomprehensible 00: 24: 05]. I-I-I know that you, um- you value friendship and - and friendship is very important, erm, and I just wonder how important, erm, it would be for you, erm, to remain friends with them and still have your-your-sobriety."
"I guess it probably wouldn't be a bad idea not to hang out with them a little bit, I think. You know, I mean, I-I-I-yes."
And see what happens.
"Yes, for sure. I think that would be something I could probably try."
"Yes, yes, how important would it be - would it be? Zero is not so important and 10 is pretty important that you -"
"Now, if I have to get my license back, I think it would be pretty important for me not to hang out with them for a while, you know."
Mm-hmm. Okay. [incomprehensible 00: 24: 52] something you would like to try. Okay.
Absolutely.
That sounds good.
Yes.
"Well, perhaps that is something we could talk about next time, if you like."
"Yes, yes."
Yes.
"I think that would be a good idea. Er, will it help me get my license back, just like - how - the plans I made really help me?"
"Well, I would certainly tell the people who need to know."
"Okay, good."
"- about the plans you aspire to. Um, the I--There would be, er, someone who could read that assessment-Mm."
"The choice is up to you. And, um, it sounds to me like there's no reason why you can't do that. You've thought a lot, and you have plans and anything else you can come up with to keep yourself out of the driver's seat when you've been drinking."
"Um, probably just not really drinking that much. I mean, if I just didn't drink, I wouldn't have to worry too much about it."
Then you wouldn't have to worry.
Yes.
"Yes, because worries are not fun."
Yes. That's right. Yes.
"Good. Well, thank you Mike. I appreciate that."
"Okay, thank you."
Thank you very much.
"Hello Mary, how was your day?"
Good. Where do you want me to sign?
"Well, you can sign directly there, and it seems that you do not feel like speaking today."
Not really.
"Okay. You know, it seems like you had a school day. I noticed that you missed your first lesson today too."
"Yes, whatever. I just, yes."
That doesn't really seem to worry you at the moment?
"It's like every day the same thing, I don't really know why. Like, erm, so I signed your paper, why are you asking me all these questions?"
So you wonder what the point of those visits is when I come home to you.
Yes.
Okay. Would you be okay if I somehow explained again what this program is about?
I think so.
"You know I'm going to drop by every day just to make sure that you're here and follow your GPS and respond to it and make sure that it's charged every day and that, erm, if you leave the house without permission, we're aware of that as well. Um, and somehow, just to get to know you when I come for those visits, erm, you know that's kind of like my role as your caseworker just to monitor your everyday things."
So you just want to know my business?
I'm sure it's pretty curious at times.
Mm-hmm.
"I know, er, some customers had difficulty understanding that I really care about you, and you know that when we first met, you had expressed the aim of ending this program as quickly as possible."
Mm-hmm.
So I know it's an opportunity to be here when you have to be here.
Mm-hmm.
"Nevertheless, one can be a little annoyed that this is something we still have to do."
"Yes. I think I'll be here if I have to, but I can't make any promises that I won't go."
So you're still a bit worried that you're not quite sure you can do this successfully?
"No, because it kind of feels like you need to know my business? Why don't you care?"
"Um, and I'm sure it's kind of confusing, because I'm sure you have a lot of other people involved with the courts in your life right now, I'm sure I know your mother is also looking after you and there's this one other person who's kind of monitoring you as well."
Mm-hmm.
I'm sure it's pretty overwhelming.
It's like a lot.
Mm-hmm.
And you get the feeling that there are all these rules.
"Yes. And there are, and I am sure that sometimes she really struggles."
Mm-hmm.
"Um, and I know that some customers expressed how much they valued their freedom, they didn't realize how much they really valued it until it was over."
"Right, I think that is the only thing I want now."
Their freedom?
Mm-hmm.
What are some ways to regain your freedom?
I appreciate how you sign your papers.
"Mm-hmm, that's a step, just sign the papers when I pass by. Even though it sometimes looks like it's kind of annoying, it's something we have under contract."
Mm-hmm.
How do you still feel like you can regain your freedom?
"Don't do it again, so I don't have to be here and be stuck in my house and all these people come to me and know my business."
"So this is something that will motivate you not to do what you did, not to commit this crime, and, erm, ""because you don't like us dropping by?"
Yes.
"That's fine. Well, I know you're making an effort. I appreciate when I drop by every now and then that you're still signing the paperwork, even if you sometimes feel it's annoying. So, thank you for, er, at least doing that."
Mm-hmm.
"Okay. Um, before I leave today, is there anything else you want to add or share with me?"
Not really.
"Okay, just so you know, I have to come back to see you again today."
All right.
All right.
Bye.
For me.
"So, erm, anyone who is in the South Whisky program should pick at least three goals they want to work on over the next 30 days, because what we're going to do is we're going to monitor you and review within 30 days how you're going to pursue your goals. In other words, we want you to pick something that's relevant to you, that you're willing to work on. So is there anything you want to change your work on either at home or at school, erm, [incomprehensible 00: 00: 30]?"
"Um, I have to start getting school on time for my first lesson. I always miss this class."
"Okay, so is it something for you to be on time for the first hour for the next 30 days?"
Yes.
Okay. What a great goal. So why do you want to make this goal for yourself?
"Er, so people are going to fall off my back."
And who are these people?
"My mom always says, you know, go to school, my dad's going to be like, you know, if you don't get to school on time, I can take you back because of sanctions, and I don't want to go back to school."
Do you want to avoid that in any case?
Yes.
Okay. So the first hour of going to school is something you will work on to achieve your goal.
I will try.
So what are some concrete steps you need to take to get to school on time from the first hour?
"I can't get up in the morning, so that's tough, and when I get up and then I get dressed, I miss the bus, so I usually end up walking or seeing if I can find a ride, so there could be a number of different reasons why I'm late."
"Okay, so isn't it just an important thing?"
No.
"So if you know that a few things can really get in your way, what do you think would be the best way to get to school on time? What do you know what to do?"
Getting up on time would probably be a good start to getting me there on time.
How long would it take you to get up?
"[sighs] If I want to catch the bus, I probably have to get up at 6: 15 and sometimes it's just so difficult because I go to bed so late and I don't know if I can make it."
"So you're still not sure if you could do that, but you say you really want to do it because you don't want to go back because of sanctions."
Correct.
Okay.
- and see how it goes.
"Okay, so are you willing to try it at least?"
Yes.
So what time would you have to go to bed at night to make sure you get up at 6: 15?
"I go at midnight now, so if I try it at maybe 11: 00, I can try it at 11: 00."
"Okay. Okay, so are you ready to go to bed at 11: 00 a.m. and set your alarm clock at 6: 15 a.m. the next morning?"
Yes.
When would be a great day for you to start?
"Er, either tomorrow or the day after tomorrow."
"Okay, so if I were to write down here, erm, what do you think - what do you want me to write? Tomorrow or the day after tomorrow?"
Let's start tomorrow.
"Tomorrow. Okay, great, so who could help you get to bed on time and make sure you get up on time at 6: 15?"
My mother.
Your mother.
Mm-hmm.
Okay. Anything your mother could do to help you with this?
"[sighs] When my alarm goes off, when I don't get up, she can come in and wake me up and remember that I told you I was going to get up so I had to do it."
"So it's almost like you want your mother to tell you that this is for you. It's not like your mother wants you to get up, as if you want your mother to remind you, ""Hey, remember, this is something you want for yourself is to be on time for your first lesson."""
Exactly.
Great. What could possibly stop you from not getting up at 6: 15?
[sighs] Don't go to bed on time.
Not going to bed on time.
"Yup, this is going to be a fight for me."
"Okay. So if you are tempted to stay up later,"
Mm-hmm.
- how could you react instead?
Just go to bed and turn off the lights without having my phone.
"Okay, so a phone is a distraction for you."
"Oh, yes."
- and even turn off the light and make it dark?
Yes.
A kind of reminder that it's time to go to bed.
Let my mother check me to make sure everything is cleared away.
And also the support of your mother.
Mm-hmm.
Great. So how do you know your plan is working?
"When I'm at school on time, when the bell rings and I'm in class."
"So when you are in your class and the bell rings, you know that this is the goal."
Absolutely.
"So what I've heard so far - what a great goal again, what a great goal. You've already had a few insights into how to do that, so it's really important for you to come at the first hour because you don't want to go back to sanction days. You don't like all these extra people controlling you and all these things. You already have a plan to go to bed at 11: 00, turn off the lights, put your cell phone away. Even your mom's support will really help you, erm, get up at 6: 15 in the morning with that alarm. I know it seems really early in the morning, but you seem ready to do it. And if you're not able to do it, your mom will help you as well."
"Yes, I hope so."
What a great plan and you said you would start tomorrow.
I'll give it a go.
"Great, thank you."
You are welcome.
So what's going on?
"I just want my call, that's it."
"Correct. Yes, I was told to call, was taken away."
[Mocks] Yes.
What happened?
"Some of them - one of the officers, it's as if he had it for me or something. I don't know - I don't know what it is. Something about not making my bed, something about my attitude. I don't know, I just want my call, man."
"Okay. Yeah, it was weird when I got that report, uh, because for the most part since you've been here, uh, you've been like, uh, model residents, uh, who always make their beds, uh, pretty, uh, respectful of the staff, all the other residents. So, uh, has it got to do with you coming out in three weeks? It's got to be pretty tough."
"I just want to contact my mum, that's it."
"Mm-hmm. Yes, you used to be in contact with your mother almost every other night, and now you haven't even spoken to her for a week. I can imagine that's quite difficult. I remember you saying something about how your father's birthday is approaching?"
My father's birthday is tomorrow.
Okay.
"And I just wanted my phone call so I could talk to my mom, that's it."
"Like I said, it's been, um, a long time, and this is basically the first time we've seen this behavior from you, so I know that a lot of other guys are just about to get out, er, a lot of fear, a lot of frustration because they haven't been out for a while, and then the pressure of being out begins to level off. So is this something that's going on with you?"
Hello. You are [incomprehensible 00: 00: 02]?
Yes.
"Okay. Er, what brings you in?"
"Well, I should come to learn something about myself - how to deal with my diabetes."
Mm-hmm. I see - I see that your A1C or your blood sugar is very high.
"Yes, that's what the doctor said. She - she really instilled that in me. She said it - I think it's really serious stuff. She talked about losing my sight, mm, my feet, mm, problems with a lot of other things, and it really scared me. Er, so [sighs] You know how to do all that, I guess that's what I need to learn, but it just sounds awesome."
"Mm-hmm. Well, you have to take your medication. We, er, will have to start eating, er, you know, losing weight, changing your eating habits, exercising, er, getting your diabetes under control, because your doctor is right, it's very serious."
"That's, erm, that's a lot to do, and I'm not sure - I'm not sure I can do all of that, and on top of that it's - if I don't do all of that stuff, is it happening to me?"
It can.
[Sigh]
"So, uh, you know, we have to start doing all the different things to get your diabetes under control, because your number is very high."
"Well, I-I [incomprehensible 00: 01: 35]"
"Hello again Mr. Green. It's really nice to see you again. If you remember the last week, we looked at your results here and you have a disordered glucose tolerance and you were a bit worried about type 2 diabetes, your blood pressure and cholesterol have gone up a bit as well. So we meet today to talk about some things you could do yourself to improve the situation and, as you know, all sorts of things can affect your health, so can we just have a little chat, but how is it going?"
"Well, I suppose you're going to give me an argument and tell me that everything is self-inflicted and I need to change my mind and give up the things I enjoy."
"Actually, I don't do that because you're the boss. It's up to you what you want to do with your own health."
The doctor said I would have to take tablets for the rest of my life.
You don't seem too happy about that.
"Well, I feel good, but the doctor said it could save my life."
"Well, there are a lot of things you can do yourself to improve the situation, so what we can do today is work through some of those things: smoking, diet, exercise, weight, weight loss, all of those things. So we'll just start and see how you feel about it."
"Okay, what should I do first?"
"Well, it's very up to you, you're the boss of your own life. Where do you want to start?"
Where do you think I should start?
"Well, I could tell you my opinion. Um, and I can give you a lot of information, but I think you know the score pretty well, and I think you would know what I would say."
"Yes, erm, tell me, stop smoking and lose weight and get more exercise, right?"
"Absolutely. Spot on. So quitting smoking would have a huge impact, it would have a big impact very early on. Losing weight would also have a big impact because it would help your blood pressure, your cholesterol and also your risk of diabetes. So what would you think of these things? Er,"
"Er, I loved losing weight, but it's so hard to give up the things you enjoy."
"It's really hard, it's hard to know where to start, right?"
I really should do it. Or shouldn't I?
How important is it for you to lose weight?
"Well, I want my children to settle down and my grandchildren to grow up, and I should be a role model for them."
So can it be that your family is important to you?
"Yes. I want to be there for them, but not a burden for them."
"Yes. So, where do you think you can start with that?"
"Er, I've been thinking a lot about her lately and I want to be there for her, so I have to do what I have to do to improve my health."
What is the first thing to think of?
"You know, first of all, I could limit my drinking. Um, that increases my weight and my blood pressure, right?"
"Yes, that would be a really good start, mm-hmm."
My wife says I drink too much at weekends.
So I think she should really support that.
And I suppose I could cut out the crisps and pies at work.
So what would you do to make sure you don't get hungry at work?
I will start eating soup at noon. I suppose a big bowl of soup would be much better than two cakes.
"Yes. Well, a big bowl of vegetable soup. You could probably call that one or maybe even two out of five a day, so it would be a really good starting point."
"Well, there's one, one, er, I've done that, I've stopped adding salt to my food, the doctor said it would help with my blood pressure."
"And the other thing you may not be aware of is that salt intake is linked to the loss of calcium from our bones, which makes the bones more fragile, so reducing salt intake will really help here too."
"Well, I didn't know that. Um, that's good to know. I tell my wife, erm, she still loves her salt a lot and her mother had osteoporosis."
"Well, maybe you can help her too, and that would be good. Well, I think you've got off to a really good start, Mr. Green. You're very well aware of what you need to do, and you've obviously thought about it and put some good plans into practice. So you're going to reduce your alcohol intake, you've already started to reduce your salt intake. Um, maybe next time we could talk a little bit about smoking and exercise, if you're willing to do it. How are you feeling now?"
"I feel like I'm making a start, but we should take one step at a time and see how it goes. But, erm, the next day, if we look at it, the numbers could be much better."
"That's great, so should we meet at the same time next week?"
"Yes, I'm fine."
"That's great, so all the best."
"Thank you, too."
"Er, welcome. And, er -"
Thank you very much.
I would say my name is Mark and I work here at Green Recipe.
Mm-hmm.
I know something about you from the doctor's referral letter.
From my GP?
"From your GP, yes."
Er.
"But before we come to anything, I would like to ask you perhaps a little bit about what prompted you to come here today and get a little idea of what is going on for you."
What motivated me to come here?
""
My GP.
And what did he have to say?
"Well, uh, you know, I kind of had my, uh, control."
""
"And it turned out that I could apparently have diabetes 2. Well, that's what he says."
Correct.
"Um, I-I think I feel completely fine. I-I am, you know - I understand that people with diabetes are a little bit fatter than me."
""
"But, erm, that's really why I'm here. I'm almost at his command."
"Right, so he gave you a directive?"
He says he'll put me on some kind of program if it gets worse.
""
"But like I said, I'm feeling absolutely good now."
"So it kind of came as a surprise, it made you feel okay."
Yes.
"You go to the doctor and he says, ""You have type 2 diabetes."""
"Mm, I'm very surprised."
MM. Did it come out of the blue for you?
"Yes, I think so."
""
""
And you said that you somehow do not fit into this type II diabetes.
""
-They were therefore overweight.
I understand that.
""
"You know, and I'm not overweight."
""
"I-I take care of myself to a certain extent. Um, but I'm a busy person, I suppose I burn the calories."
""
I really don't know.
""
My lifestyle -
"Hmm. So it doesn't quite fit in your head, type II diabetes and"
No.
-Your lifestyle?
"No, not at all."
"That is a big surprise, and how did you react when he told you about it?"
"Well, I thought he must be joking, to be honest."
""
- You know why you are - look around.
"Mm, mm."
"Um, I just felt like um-- I mean, I don't think he's wasting my time, because why would he?"
"Yes, yes."
Right?
He has a lot to do.
"Er, absolutely right."
""
He has a job to do and obviously the tests have passed and I have these signs of diabetes.
Correct.
"Right? Um, I just think that - well, I just don't fancy it, Mark."
""
Um -
How do you feel in your head?
I feel absolutely fine.
- and what the tests say does not fit together.
"Yes. Physically, I feel absolutely good."
""
I am - I've seen nothing wrong with myself at all.
Hmm.
"I mean, I get around, I sleep pretty well."
Hmm-hmm.
I'm the kind of person who knows
Hmm.
- I am-I am compos mentis. So I do not -
Yes. What is the problem? Mm.
What's the problem?
"And how did that happen, you probably think as well. Well, how did that happen?"
"Well, er, yes."
""
"-I have to admit that I did not do too much research, but was a bit busy."
Okay.
"Um, but he-he said something about, I don't know, family or whatever. I don't know."
Yes.
And I don't know if it's hereditary.
""
I think he said something about it being hereditary.
So he mentioned that it could be a family affair.
Yes.
- maybe from your parents or something.
"Yes, it could be."
""
"-because, erm, my mother mentioned -"
""
"- that, er, my father had diabetes -"
Correct.
"2. And when I think about it, erm, his brother"
Mm-hmm.
"-er, I haven't seen him in years."
Yes.
"But he might well have, because he is"
""
- a pretty cuddly guy.
Correct.
He's pretty big.
That's how he fits into the picture.
"Well, the stereotype, -"
"- if you think about what he-he--yes, he is stereotypical."
"Yes, I guess."
"A bit taller, maybe doesn't look after himself so well, and he sits on that foot"
"Yes, I mean, as far as I know, I had never seen him."
Yes.
'I don't know how many years.
Mm. So did you get this knowledge as a witness that there was a certain family history of diabetes in the past?
"Apparently yes. Yes, apparently yes."
Doctor mentioned this as a factor.
"Mm, I mean, it's hereditary, right?"
"Yes. We know that in people who had parents or were in the past, an inheritance or genetic factor plays a role."
"A genetic factor. So does that mean that if you have, er, a family history of it?"
""
"- if it is a gene, is it more likely that you will get it?"
Right.
""
But it is not inevitable.
Right. Okay.
"Because his genes or the inheritance factor are not the only factor that causes him or is involved in his passing, so there are other factors that come into play."
I am sure you will tell me what they are.
"Well, you mentioned some of the things that you know, and one of them are hereditary factors. You mentioned that the doctor mentioned that. And what else do you know or have you heard? You say you haven't had much time to do the research. What else? Other things that you have."
"To be honest, Mark, I honestly don't know. I mean, I honestly don't know what the cause is because I never had a reason. It came from the GP and it set me back."
Yes.
"Um, the inherited thing I thought, well, maybe that's the explanation."
That makes a bit of sense.
"And why go any further, it's there?"
Yes.
Can't help it.
Yes.
"They live a pretty long life, they did, all right."
They got away with it.
Relatives lived relatively well into their 70s.
Okay. I don't know if it would be helpful for you to want to know a little more about some of the factors that play a role in type II diabetes.
Well.
If that would help.
"If there is something you think it is - yes. Yes, of course."
"Well, maybe I can tell you what I know from working with other people and what I have experienced in working with people."
Okay.
"We know that there is a strong family or hereditary factor, so that's one aspect. So it tends to happen a little later in life, rather than something you might get as a teenager, that kind of diabetes. So it's a later onset. It takes a bit of time to maybe develop, and the main reason, er, the main aspect of it is that you've heard about insulin."
"I heard about it, yes."
So this is a hormone or chemical that allows you to process sugar in your body.
Correct.
"And type II diabetes typically has resistance to insulin in its cells, fat cells, or muscle or liver cells. You cannot use insulin, so sugar builds up in your system."
Are you saying that they can't digest insulin or not?
"You need insulin in your cells, individual cells in muscles or fat, or wherever, to consume excess sugar or to process sugar."
"Oh, I see. So - it's like that - it's like a balance."
That is true.
So insulin you-you.
Kind of like you.
You have raised the bar yourself.
Yep.
"Or something, and what compensates for that in the body is insulin, which breaks down the excess."
Yes.
Or digestion? Should I say excessive sugar?
That's a good way of thinking.
Is that the case?
Exactly. And what happens with type II diabetes is that your fat cells and liver cells and muscle cells are resistant to insulin. It's almost as if they say we can't use that.
Why?
"We are not quite sure, there is still a lot of research into how this is happening and how it could be modified, but what we do know is that one of the most important things in tackling this problem is trying to change or modulate the amount of sugar that is in your system."
Right. Okay.
"Yes. So there are a couple of things we know that people with type II diabetes need to be careful and think about whether they want to control the amount of sugar in their system, which is the main problem that causes some of the health problems that people with type II diabetes have. Too much sugar and if it's not able to be utilized in the blood cell, in the fat cells or liver cells and the muscle cells stay in the blood, and that can lead to circulatory problems. So, high blood sugar and low blood sugar can be a problem. So sugar is the main concern with type II diabetes. And you mentioned a couple of things that the doctor mentioned earlier - you mentioned some signs that he was a little bit worried about. Well, what things have you noticed in the last few months or so?"
You mean that personally?
Yes.
"Well, I didn't know. I mean, the thing is, you see that - I mean, I thought about it a little bit and I thought, well, over time, when things happen slowly, you don't really realize it."
Yes.
As you get older.
Yes.
"I mean, I don't jump - I don't jump over five bars like I used to, you know, erm, unlike, erm, I'm running with my back now, I tend to spend more time in the bar with my old mates, you know."
Yes.
"At the rugby club and so on, yeah. And, um, the fish I hook, I'm not chasing the kings anymore, I'm reaching for the snapper now, that's a bit easier, you know."
A quieter lifestyle.
Absolutely.
Yes.
"You just do it. Um, so I think you're less demanding on your body, you realize, and you don't really want to do these things anyway. You know, you let the young people go home."
Yes.
"So I come back to this diagnosis I got from my GP and he says, ""You have diabetes 2,"" well, that's how I should feel, right?"
Yes. It should feel like something is really wrong with you.
"Yes, I mean."
"How did you feel the last month? So you say you are very busy, you do a lot of work."
"Yes, I mean, I'm a busy person. Good? I uh, my job uh, I work in insurance, so I always hop from one place to another."
Yes.
"Um, I didn't notice that."
Mh-hmm.
"I really didn't notice how, um, okay, I bite - I suppose sometimes I run out of breath."
Okay.
"If I rush too much - that's right. Er, I suppose, erm, I don't go up the stairs in twos anymore, I use one after the other."
So sometimes a little energy is not quite there? The vitality.
"Oh, certainly the energy I have is not what I had. I mean, I have to sit down, you know, I'm busy, but I have to sit down, er, I have to sit down and relax with a cup of coffee, you know, and, er, things."
"Yes, Mh-hmm."
"Um, more than I would normally do."
Yes.
"But that would be it, that would be it."
Mh-hmm.
"Um, is it getting worse? I don't know. I-I-guess. What's worse? Is it getting worse? Well, to say it, I don't really notice."
"You didn't notice it. So it's a progressive, you know, you've just seen that as you've gotten older, things have slowed down. You know the activities you used to do, but that's kind of what's happening."
"Yes, yes. Er, at least I think so. I mean, I don't know if you're telling me to be more active or my GP is telling me to be more active."
Mh-hmm.
"Um, like I said, uh, you know, I don't do regular sports, I have to say, no more."
Yes.
Um.
Okay.
But maybe I don't know.
"Hmm, a bit of a mystery."
"I mean, I have, um, well, I mean, I have a great lifestyle. I mean, when it's very good. I mean, I've got all my mates in the rugby club. And I've got, um, you know, even in the summer, if that's a bit damn good. I used to coach rugby and I used to coach cricket when I was done. So I've got the guys at the cricket club, um, you know, for the, um, summer evenings. And, um, and then, um, then of course we've got fishing, and that's all of us together. We're a big gang, really."
Really? So what I'm hearing is that there are actually many aspects of your life that are really good.
"Oh, I think my life is great."
Is it going well from your point of view?
"My life is great, and then you turn around and say, ""Hey, you gotta - you're sick, you're sick."
"Yes, that's not right."
"But you see, he said to me that he would put me on a kind of, er, daily sugar monitoring."
Mh-hmm.
And I will have to take regular tablets.
Correct.
"Frankly, the only tablets I take are some kind of paracetamol."
"Yes. If you get a headache, erm."
"For a small part of the head in the morning, you know."
Yes.
Um.
So the idea of having to test your blood sugar and take medication is kind of out of the blue.
"Come on, you know."
And you know that's a bit too much.
"Well, life is too short."
Too much.
They know it's the truth.
"Yes, OK."
"I mean, you know -"
"And you're here today and that's probably something inside you that you thought I was going to do well, you know, I'm going to come and see what they have to say, and I just wonder, for this session, for the time we have today, there's a bunch of things that we could talk about. You mentioned a few things about your lifestyle and, um, medication is one thing that the doctor told you you you have to do, and a bunch of things that we could talk about today. What area would you consider useful that you'd focus on?"
"Well, there's something that made me think about it, and, uh, I broke up -- My wife and I split up a few years ago. And, uh, you know, we've been married for many years."
Hmm.
"And uh, I think she used to take care of me because she did the cooking and stuff like that."
Okay.
And I have to say I'm not the best cook in the world.
Mh-hmm.
"Um, and being on the run all the time, and when I get home, it's time, you know, to go to the rugby club or whatever it may be, er, we're out with the pals. And, er, I think my food may not be as healthy as it was when she was there. She's moved to Hamilton to live with her mom when you met her mom. Anyway, uh."
"So if you are on your own since the separation, get divorced and notice that the things you eat and how you eat have changed."
"Yeah, I mean, pals and their wives are pretty cool sometimes."
Hmm.
"Because, you know, they're going to invite me to dinner and so on."
"Yes, yes."
"And yes, yes, yes, yes. I guess, you know, that's when you split up, well, or for some reason, in life."
Hmm.
"You start looking at someone else's home life, you think, ""Hmm, I use d to have that."""
"Hmm. Yes, yes."
"And you think, ""That's good food, isn't it?"" and you know it."
Yes. And you - part of your wife has done a lot of this for you?
"Oh, she would do all the cooking. Yes, yes,"
Yes.
"I mean, I never bothered boiling an egg in water, you know."
"And so she kind of took care of what you ate and healthy things you had, things you spread out in front of you, and off you went."
"I mean, I was only responsible for the wine, you know."
Mm-hmm. And now you have to think about what you want to eat and sometimes you don't eat the best.
"Well, that's what I'm saying. Maybe I'm not thinking about it. Maybe it's the thing."
Okay.
Maybe it's just me -
Hmm.
"You know, because it's - you know - the pizza shop just down the street."
Yes.
"And then there's -- I mean, okay, I'll admit that lunch time, occasionally, er, I'm hungry and McDonald's is very convenient."
Yes.
or Kentucky Fried or whatever.
"Very attractive, isn't it?"
"You know, it's very simple, and then, uh, you think to yourself, well, I mean, I think to myself, maybe I should have some vegetables here or whatever, but then you go to the supermarkets, you know, and you can get your, uh, TV dinner."
"Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm."
So you bring them in and open them and put them in the microwave and there's vegetables.
"Yes, they look pretty good on a plate, don't they?"
"Yes, it looks good - it looks good, you know, and so on. I mean, it will happen occasionally if I have a night inside, but from the point of view of cooking, no, I haven't boiled anything, um, except boiling the water for the kettle for a cup of coffee."
Yes.
- for ages.
"They are decisions about what you eat and what is in your diet, it is not what you are actually aware of or what you had to think about in the past."
Yes. I miss her breakfast. I have to say we used to have a nice breakfast.
So one thing that has caught your eye is diet and eating habits.
Well -
- when you eat. That's one aspect. What other aspects do you think you are?
"Well, I used to be a pretty heavy smoker, right? I mean, I smoked a pack in half a day. And I knew it wasn't good for me."
Correct.
"I mean, the thing is when you're a - I mean, I've always smoked. So, but when you're young and you're an athlete, you know -"
You kind of juggle these two things and you're friendly.
"Well, you know, the two things that balance them, and everyone else is."
You still walk and have a cigarette?
"You know, you almost put a cigarette down the back, right? You know, just before the game starts -"
"Hmm. Hmm. Yes, part of the culture."
"Yes, part of it, and it's changed a bit now because in my day when we played, it was obviously a lot more of a social game spent at the rugby club."
Yes.
That's why you played and it was a big buddy-buddy thing.
Yes.
It was rugby and cricket really was the same thing.
Hmm.
"Um, but now -"
"But over the years, have you actually reduced or stopped smoking altogether or temporarily?"
"Well, me-me, yeah. I got a little bit kind of - I got a little bit, you know, a little bit nervous and I thought, ""I'm going to cut this out."""
Hmm.
But I like smoking. I really enjoy it. So I reduce it to about 10 a day.
"Okay, so you wanted to cut back."
"Yes, yes."
It has been noted that it has an effect on breathing and the health has not been so good.
Yes.
"If you linked this to your smoking, you were able to reduce your smoking."
"Yes, yes."
So you took our decision to do that?
"You know, she'll say, ""Why don't you give up? You've gone so far, why don't you just stop?"" But I don't want to."
Hmm.
"It's-it's-- I-I enjoy it, um -"
"Yes, and it's hard to stop something you enjoy, right?"
"Well, yes, I mean, you know, the thing is that you get to do it, you know, you have to do it - if you do that, you, er, you have to do some kind of regulation."
Hmm.
"You know, I think we have to show a certain amount of strong will."
Yes.
"So you say, ""Okay, well, you don't have a cigarette unless you have a cup of coffee. [laughs]"
Hmm.
"Of course it's a bit of a double-edged sword, because then I found out I was drinking more coffee, you know."
But they go so well together - and sugar in coffee?
"Oh, yeah, yeah. I have two sugars. A few sugars in the coffee. Yes, yeah."
Hmm.
"So, as I said, let's cut it short."
Hmm.
"But the problem is that coffee, we're up to 8 or so, 10 cups of coffee a day now."
"You drink more coffee. So what I've heard from you so far is if I can just start over again and you come in and say, ""I went to the doctor."" You forgot - it sounds like you just went for a checkup."
"No, you know, there's a friend of mine, one of the guys at the rugby club, he said - he said, ""I'm going to my annual, you know -"
The MIT.
"Guarantee of fitness, that sort of thing, you know. And I thought now that's an idea, not been on one of them."
"Do you have to look at that, why not?"
"So I'm 55 and you read in the newspaper, you know, at 55 you want that - you know, heart disease is more common."
Hmm.
"- and all those things that you get in this medieval period, so I thought, ""Well, I'm going to have one."" And honestly, when I went along, I was very confident. I thought, you know, the doctor will say, ""Hmm, I wish I was as healthy as you are,"" something like that."
Yes.
"Um, but unfortunately, er, he-he came up with that, and it's the only thing I think he really came up with."
So everything else looked pretty good?
"My cholesterol is pretty good, not so bad."
"Cholesterol good, weight good."
"Yes, yes. Not so bad."
"Um, you smoke, but you've managed to reduce that."
"Well, I reduced it, yes. I mean, that's three years, mind you."
"And everything else, you know, you tick the list: the tyres are good, the oil is good."
Absolutely.
So we look good.
And then we come to the following:
"And oh, hold on."
- too much sugar in the tank or something. I don't know.
"Yes, there's something wrong with that, er, bit."
"Yes, yes."
And it doesn't quite fit with how you see your own lifestyle.
No.
"Because you -- it sounds like what you've done, you've made some conscious efforts to make yourself aware of some of the things you might think are important."
"I mean, yeah. I mean, you know, the thing is, you see, the thing is, and I mean, and you probably mean that - I think you've heard that before, but people, they're turning around, oh, uh, you know, doom prophets, you shouldn't drink."
""
You shouldn't smoke.
Yes.
"And then I think, ""Well, maybe I shouldn't be talking."" And then, ""Well, maybe I shouldn't be alive."""
"So it's like a domino effect, and they're all just going to sit there."
"You know. I mean, what-what-is-going-on here? That's - that's - the life of so many people."
Mm-hm.
"And uh, I suppose you know, when it comes down to it, and somebody said, ""Well, you can solve this problem by taking a pill once a day, uh, you know, it keeps it low and there won't be any problems,"" then I-I could do that, but what I don't want to do, uh, said the doctor or implied that I would have to change my lifestyle."
It's a bit like having to change everything.
"Yes. It was over, and I said, well, no. I'm sorry. [coughs] I'm not going to change my lifestyle. I have to get to where I am. I'm reasonably happy. Okay, I wish I wasn't separated. Okay, I wish my kids were still there, uh, you know. One of them is now in, uh, back in Europe playing rugby in France."
"Yes. And your thought was, yes, right, I hear that, but actually I don't want to make all these big changes in my life."
"No, I don't want that because I don't feel I have to."
Feel like you have to. Yes.
"I mean, you know why?"
""
"Um, I can't argue with a doctor, Mark, because I don't know anything, you know."
"The test is the test and the experience, yes."
"So, I mean, what-what-what-what-do you have?"
"I don't know. I think it's up to you where we start, and that's the question that goes through my mind, you mentioned a few things that you have already tried hard or been aware of, you mentioned diet, you mentioned your smoking, those are two very important aspects that we often talk about here when it comes to how people work."
Does smoking then have anything to do with diabetes?
"It can have an impact, yes. So smoking affects, er, your blood system, so it hardens the arteries, er, and over time it can have a significant impact on wound healing. So people with type II diabetes often need a long time to heal when they get a cut or bruise or something. Smoking reduces the amount of oxygen in your system, so the time it takes your body to heal can be further limited."
Oh.
So we know that smoking and type 2 diabetes go hand in hand.
It doesn't help.
-is not a good combination.
"Is it okay to have one without the other? I'm sorry, that's a stupid question. [laughs]"
"Now, the question I have for you is, where would you think that would be a good starting point for you? If you were to make any changes, even small changes at the beginning, instead of just thinking, oh, I would have to change everything that sounds like you are not ready to change an entire lifestyle, and I don't think that's what we're talking about here. Where would you feel most comfortable at the beginning, if you were to make any changes at all?"
"Where would I start? Well, me - what if I reduced the sugar in coffee? If we could have long blacks, no milk and no sugar."
"Yes. Hmm, that could be a start."
I think I could - I think I could probably handle it.
"Hm. What we also find is that people make these small changes, small changes, and it starts off kind of well, it makes them."
Something like a rollover effect.
"rollover, the domino effect begins, and they begin to turn to other aspects."
"Domino's effect, yes."
"So instead of thinking, ""Oh my God, I need to change all these things. I need to quit smoking, I need to move more, I need to, you know, start eating more fruit and vegetables,"" you could start with these little changes, and then"
"I mean, how much exercise should I do per week?"
"Um, I hesitate to give a recipe for it because I think it's really up to you, and I think it depends on how things go, how much you have to do."
Correct.
You mentioned earlier that doctors are talking about monitoring your blood sugar.
Yes.
"So it depends on how it goes. Let's say that if you start doing that and exercise a bit more, you have longer blacks instead of short blacks with a lot of sugar. And if you get the sugar down and you notice that the blood sugar starts to drop, then we're moving in the right direction."
"Okay, so -"
"So I think it's really down to how things are going for you, and you get that feedback, and if that's going in the right direction, you go on and do a little bit more of it."
"So, a say that, really all I have to do for this moment is that I can forget everything, but I can cut out the sugar, erm, in the coffee and the milk - I don't know, but you might as well, you know, sugar-free milk is stupid. But, erm, if we do that, do we start with that?"
I think we start where we feel comfortable.
"Well, I mean, it's not hard to do."
Apples for breakfast.
"You start at breakfast and get an apple, a bit of apple and so on. Um -"
So what I am hearing from you is that there are some very useful small starting points.
Maybe.
"No big changes, but a few little things you could do."
Yes.
"And it kind of dawns on you that there might be some ways to make some changes here. Let me ask you this. Um, let's say you're starting some of these things and starting to make some of these small changes."
Yes.
"Um, where do you see that in the next three, four, five years? Do you know where do you want to be in three or four years? What would be your ideal image?"
"You know, and it's difficult because I don't feel unhealthy now."
No.
"So, I suppose it would be fun - maybe I should join one or two clubs, I think, because I'll be with pals."
Yes? You like the social aspect?
"I love the social aspect and, um, there is - I know there is a bar in this club too. So, don't get me wrong, I don't drink."
"No, no, I understand that, I understand that."
"-till-- You know, I'm not an alcoholic or anything like that, I -"
"So part of this whole fitness and exercise programme is actually the social side, isn't it?"
"So yeah, to get that balance, and maybe that's what I'm really missing in life, and maybe that's what -- I mean yeah, I get up sometimes in the morning, and I guess I feel a little --"
Yes.
"You know? Even after a decent night's sleep, you know?"
It's not quite true.
And you need - I get this cup of coffee and maybe it's me -
And the coffee helps a bit because it spoils you?
And that gets me going. Yes.
And the sugar in it helps too.
"Yes, the sugar gives me a boost, I think. I-it's fantastic."
"So what I hear is that your life, your work, your routines are like that - sometimes you drive or you have to stay awake, sometimes you get up in the morning and you don't quite have the momentum or the energy. You need a shot, and then you just need more shots all day to keep that energy up."
"Hmm. If I forgo sugar in my coffee, it's milk, black coffee, right?"
Yes.
"when I find a social form of exercise, like squash."
And an activity that is slowly coming to an end and is something you do for a slot.
Yes.
And then there are perhaps a few social aspects.
"Yes, and then -"
You can see some advantages and some joy in it.
"And then, you know, give it, say, six months, I don't know how long that would take, then go back to the GP and say, ""Check me again."""
That sounds like a great plan.
"And so it might be, er -"
"Yes, sounds like a good idea."
Maybe it's an idea. I mean -
"I think everything you do has to be something you've decided to do. You know, just start where you want to start. You've mentioned some really good ideas on how you might get a little bit more exercise into your life and do something like squash or something like that. You've mentioned some really good ideas on how you can reduce the amount of sugar you - you - consume during the day, and coffee is a good starting point. Having an apple for breakfast, I think you've mentioned that, a bit of fruit."
"Yes, as my wife used to do."
"These are some really good ideas and good starting points. So when you think about it like this, what - where do you stand now? What is your - what - where - where do you think now?"
"Well, you see, I mean, I think, ""Actually, that's not a bad idea,"" because [giggles] it would mean I could socialize harder, right? No, no, I'm just joking. Er, but, er, yeah, I mean, why not? Why not? Why not? It might be fun, it's a new way."
"What is there to lose, what to gain?"
"Well, it seems like there's something to win, and -- I mean, what do I lose? I don't know until I do it. But I think if I do it and do what I enjoy doing, I'm not going to miss what I don't do. Does that make sense?"
"It makes sense, yes."
"Er, yes, I don't mind."
"So when you look at it, there is probably more to win than to lose."
"I'm going to talk to Billy about it, um-- Billy is, er, he's the gym guy."
Correct.
I'll have a word with him because I'm at the club tonight.
Yes.
Really.
"So you have to work these things in your head. You know, and you have to train where to start."
"Yes, I think you say where you are now, where you are going, where -"
Yes.
-and-and-and-that's what I have to do. I think I'm at a dead end.
Stuck?
"I'm-I-am-I-am-I-content, er, I'm sitting in this mess and, er, my doctor has actually diagnosed me with diabetes 2."
Yes?
"- which, as he says, can be managed, and you seem to imply that it can be managed."
"Yes, yes."
"Er, maybe that's actually a blessing."
Better not.
"- because I think to myself: ""Well, if one day I get a diagnosis of diabetes, I just keep going."""
Move on.
"""I'm sitting in the corner of the bar chatting, talking and probably getting fat."" I don't know and I'm making it worse. And, yes, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe."
"So it was a bit of a shock - a bit of a shock, but now you kind of reflect that."
"Yeah, that's cool."
Maybe that's the case.
That's really cool.
"Mighty -- From my perspective, from your perspective, you think, ""Well, what's the problem? Everything's fine."""
""
"But now you seem to think: ""Maybe things weren't as good as I thought they were."""
"Yes, I mean, I think you're quite right. I think you -"
Things could be better?
"I don't know you're going to be seated, do you? No, it seems so - no, that's actually pretty exciting. It's pretty [incomprehensible 00: 31: 28]"
"Yes, I feel it. I feel it in you, that you -"
"I think to myself, I think, ""Oh,"" I think, go -"
Fairly strengthened by the idea of -
"Yes. I mean, that's - that's - that's cool, it's like an old challenge again."
"To make some of those changes, yes."
"That's good. And, um -"
Are you up for the challenge?
"I mean, I never thought about it, but when I think about it now, it's, ""What am I doing here?"" Why am I like that? Why am I just happy to be floated?"
So think about when you were - that's an interesting question to see what you think. You were - you were a coach. You - maybe you will be a coach again.
Yes.
"What would you say if you were talking to yourself, if you wanted to, you know if you were the coach saying, ""Right."""
"Oh, if I was obscene - if I was somehow obscene -"
"Yes, what would you say?"
- as it were?
Yes.
"If I was watching myself, what would I say? I-I--Well, I would say, you know, are you happy?"
Yes.
That -- Are you satisfied with this performance from you and your team?
"And, I suppose, our own personalized a bit like that, there are many different aspects that need to be customized."
Yes.
"Modified and looked at to get the best out of ourselves, to get the best out of the chances we have."
"I think you're right. I think um--And again, you put them together and it's-it-always-it-is-kind of an individual team job, isn't it?"
"Yes, yes."
"That, okay, do a little bit of that and do a little bit of that."
"Some good things in which I am good, and there are other aspects that we consider ""good."""
"Yes, but I really don't have to give up anything, do I?"
It's not about giving up your personality or
No.
-You fundamentally change who you are.
"No, it's not."
"It's easy to tweak things. Just fine-tune a few areas and be a little bit aw-conscious of an aspect of your life, like food choice or whatever. Well, Mike, I-I really enjoyed listening to your perspective and your story a little bit, and it helped me a lot to get an idea of where you're coming from, and a little bit of who you are and what happened in your past. And - and we also talked a little bit about what's going to happen next, and you came up with some great ideas. What I hear you say is that before you meet the GP, things will be alright. Well, as you would have it - as you know, as you saw it, you just do your thing and keep working."
Mm-hmm.
It comes to mind and speaks a bit today about how you felt. At first it can be quite a shock. It didn't quite fit with how you saw things.
"True, true."
"And as we talk, I hear you say that things may not have been quite as good as you thought."
"Now that I'm thinking about it - now that I'm thinking about it, maybe."
Yes.
Maybe they were.
"And what I'm also hearing you say is maybe that--it's now more likely in your mind that you could make some of those changes instead of, you know, making big changes in your lifestyle. It's not about changing who you are, it's not changing big facets of your life, but maybe small steps that need to be taken."
"Yes, you see -"
"What you think about, what that might be."
"MM. When your life comes to a standstill,"
""
"-your family separates, or whatever, and you have nothing left, I-I think you stop really caring. Er, you know, you stop caring for yourself"
Yes.
Because everything is simple.
No one there either.
"No one there, [crosstalk] it's true and stuff, -"
Yes.
"-you know, -"
Mhm.
You don't care.
So now is the time.
So maybe that's [crosstalk]
- to take a little more care of yourself.
"Maybe a little selfish, but maybe why not?"
Why not?
"Why not? Yes, that's a good idea."
"Yes. So we have run out of time, but I would like to ask you one last question: where from here, what happens next?"
"Oh right, well, what we were talking about. Now you know, er, okay, er, coffee. Right? No sugar."
Do you start with that?
That's where I start.
Yes.
"Um, I'm going to, er, I'm going to talk to Bill, er,"
The gym.
"-about the gym, but"
Yes.
-I like the idea of actually playing squash again
Yes.
- or something else -
Yes.
- and I will go to the rugby club and I will - I know that will be accepted. I will offer my services again because -
Yes.
- it was reasonably successful.
Yes.
"And, er -"
And you also mentioned that you might go to the doctor again and inform him a little bit about the current situation.
"No, [counter conversation], well, okay, yes, I don't have that - yes, I go back and say - well, look, I'd rather not go to the doctor and say, ""I'll do this, that, that."""
Yes.
-this and that.
Mhm.
That's between you and me.
Yes.
All right?
That's fine.
"But that is exactly what I am going to do. All right? And as I said, I will inquire, I will start with that."
Sure.
"-I give up, erm, I give up the V-drinks, -"
Mhm.
"-I think, uh, look at a better wine. [Laughter] Um, and I would really be interested."
Are you going to make a start?
"I'll be really interested - and, er, but it's pretty exciting, Mark."
"Well, just to help you, because there are probably many other questions that you could have, other questions that could arise after this session."
Yes.
"- Before we leave, I just want to give you some information that could help you."
Not too much.
"Not too much, just a few things that might give you a bit of background on the"
"Yes, yes."
-some of the things that
"Just give me a bit of background, really."
"-to type-to type-II diabetes and some, -"
"Oh, yes, and what is it?"
[incomprehensible 00: 36: 53] some of it.
"- because I don't really know. Yes, yes."
"Um, and I would be happy if we could meet again to catch up with you and make an appointment before you leave."
Okay.
-see what small changes you have managed. I would be really [incomprehensible 00: 37: 07] -
What are we talking about in a few months?
It's really up to you. Probably a bit earlier would be good.
What in about a month?
That would be great.
"Yeah, okay, I'm ready for it."
What does that sound like?
"Yeah, now-now, that makes me, um, that's very gentle to put my head on the block."
Because you don't know the timeframe?
"- And that doesn't bother me, because, um, yeah, that's cool."
Mhm.
"Yes, yes. I will see you in a month."
Yes.
Don't worry.
"Excellent, excellent. Thank you, Mike. [Scam]"
And I appreciate it. Thank you.
"Hello, Mr Stowe."
Hey.
How are you today? I am Bruce Berger.
Pleasure to meet you.
"I, er, I am a case manager with your health plan. I understand that you have come today to talk about your diabetes."
"Yes. I'm supposed to learn how to deal with it. I've just been told I have diabetes and apparently it's pretty bad, uh, she said my blood sugar is sky high, and then she put all these enormous consequences on things that can happen. It just sounds so catastrophic and, uh, and then she told me I have to do all this stuff. And man, I'm kind of disappointed right now."
"So you've just seen the doctor and, uh, you know, you sound like you've just gone blind, uh, with, uh, not just like, how scary that seems, that you have diabetes and that, uh, she's told you a whole lot of things that can happen to your eyes, your circulation and all that other stuff."
She mentioned that my legs had problems and
"And so you're kind of reeling from it all at the moment, uh, and you sound a bit pretty, actually quite scared."
"I don't want that to happen to me, but then when she reels off all these things that I have to do and I kind of go, oh, you know, I'm not sure I can do it at all, so it's kind of sitting - well, you know, I'm sitting here thinking, oh my God, this is - this is going to happen to me."
That's how it sounds.
"And it's disheartening, just as disheartening."
"So it sounds a lot like, erm, in addition to the fact that you have something that you're really afraid of, having consequences in terms of anything that can happen, which also worries you, are all the different things you have to do to get it under control. You can't imagine doing all these things, so you almost feel like all this bad stuff is going to happen."
"Yes. It looks like a huge task that I might not be able to handle. And then all this horrible stuff happens to me. I mean, it's a bleak-looking situation and much worse."
"Okay. And I want to help you break this down into a few feasible chunks so that we can lower your blood sugar. I, you know, on the one hand, your doctor is right, you know. Your blood sugar is very high and we want to lower it so that these consequences do not occur. Er, and - and there are a number of things you need to do to lower your blood sugar. Er, you know, on the other hand, we can take this step at a time so that it is not so overwhelming."
"And I would like you to be able to tell me what you can do right now. You know, for example, that there are basically three things that need to be worked out in diabetes: Take your medicine as prescribed, and frankly, if I were to work on one thing right away, given that everything seems so overwhelming, that would probably be the first thing - because that will have the greatest effect. What does that sound like so far?"
"Well, I don't think taking the medication is too much of a hassle, especially as I understand that my blood sugar is really high."
So that's easy to do.
"Yes, I'm pretty good at taking drugs."
"Yes. ""Because it looks like you just have to take your medication once a day after prescribing, er, er, that sounds doable now."
Yes. I think I could probably do that.
"Okay. The other things that need to be worked on over time would certainly be to change your eating habits to eat healthier, er, not necessarily less, but healthier. And the other thing would be to get more physical activity, um, and that doesn't mean going to the gym by the way. That means things like running more, maybe using a staircase instead of an elevator or an escalator, that sort of thing. Er."
"Well, she also mentioned monitoring my blood sugar levels and all that, and it felt like a lot of mumbo-jambo to me."
"Yes. And that really means giving you feedback on how these other things work, so it keeps you on the task."
"Oh, okay."
"So it helps you to know that when you take your medication, when you change your eating habits, it really affects your blood sugar because it will stop you from having all these other problems."
"Well, I like it that I, you know, that - that we can do it step by step. I mean, that - that takes some pressure off."
Okay.
"And to be able to talk to you and do that while we're going along, rather not - I-I wasn't sure if I could just, whining, turn this huge program into [giggles] into a reality. Er, but to take one step at a time and I, you know, that - taking the medication, I think that's not a big problem. I can, I'm pretty sure about that."
It sounds as though you are very committed to this.
"Yes. I think I could. Er, as long as there are no major side effects, but, erm -"
"Well, Mr. Smith, that's your medicine."
Fine.
Blood pressure is a bit too high.
Yes.
Okay. I wonder if I could raise the issue of your weight.
""
I wondered if we could just spend a few minutes talking about your weight.
"You're joking, aren't you? I mean, look, I took my time on my day to come here."
Yes.
I'm being held in your waiting room.
Yes.
-for 45 minutes.
Yes.
This is not acceptable.
Yes.
You know?
Yes.
When I make an appointment with a customer for 10: 00-
Yes.
-I expect them to start at 10: 00 and not at 10: 45.
"Right, and you - so you are busy enough, and -"
"Yes, I have other things to do."
Yes.
I have customers coming.
"Yes, yes."
You know?
"And it was not, in essence, easy for you to take the time to come down, and you had to wait in the waiting room, and now I have raised the issue of weight just when you are thinking of going."
"Yes, I mean, okay, fair enough, er, I must have my blood pressure."
"Yes, yes, yes."
"drugs, but I really don't have time to talk about my weight. I mean, you know, I'm aware of my weight."
Correct.
I am aware of the problems and I am also aware of the solutions.
Correct.
"Um, so I don't really need a discussion, it's just that I have too much to do at the moment, you know?"
Right. So it was a bit of a hurry for you to come in.
Yes.
"And, I regret the wait in the waiting room."
"Well, it's b - it's bad form, you know?"
"Yes, yes, that is, er, and that is not easy for you, because you want to go so fast, and here I ask you to spend only a few minutes with me."
"Yes, but I have a lot of work to do."
Yes.
I have to go back to the office.
Yes.
I've got a lot of work to do.
Yes.
- I have to deal with that.
Yes.
And every time - every moment outside of my day -
Yes.
-means that I have to work in the evenings -
Yes.
- or on weekends.
"Yes, it matters."
"Well, if you're self-employed, you don't have a choice, do you?"
"Yes, exactly. Exactly. It's up to you, just a few minutes."
"Well, I'm here now, so yeah, okay, if it's a few minutes, yeah?"
I promise.
"Okay, because I really need to keep going."
I just wanted to ask you how you feel?
"About what-what, losing weight? Well, of course, I-want."
Yes.
"Er, yeah, I mean, who doesn't? I mean, I'm aware that I'm above my, uh, uh, b-b-b balance, but I know now that it's causing problems. I obviously mean that I'm running out of breath when I have to cry something, and I realize that I have that blood pressure."
Correct.
"-Um, and maybe that helps."
"Right. That way you can see the relationship between your weight and your health, and you want things to get a bit better."
"Yes, I mean, there are more other things, but I mean, yes, the weight is a- is a- is something I'd like to get rid of. They get off [inaudible 00: 03: 17]"
Do you want that if you could?
"Yes, I mean, I know, uh, that - the theories of a bit of regular exercise, uh, a balanced diet. Uh, but unfortunately, because of my lifestyle, because she's self-employed as an accountant, she finds the time, uh, to exercise, but also to find the time to think, ""Okay, I'm going to go shopping for this, that and that"" -"
Yes.
"- ""I prepare a meal."""
Yes.
For me it is very often -
"Ready meals, and that sort of thing."
"Yes, yes. Food on the run, you know?"
"Okay, yes."
Willow.
"Let me see if I can sum up what you said, um, and then we'll see what comes next. Um, you lead a busy life."
Yes.
"Um, you run a business, and you have a lot to do."
Yes.
"Yes. Er, you are aware of the correlations between your health and your weight and to some extent you are concerned about it, and ideally it sounds as if you would like to do something about it, it is just that your life is busy and hurried, and you tend to use ready meals to get the job done."
"Yes, I mean, because of my lifestyle, food is just fuel to a certain extent."
"Yes, yes."
"You know? Um, because I'm juggling all these balls and I don't want to drop any."
"I get it. I get it. So if you could fit it in, you'd like things to be different, but it's not that easy."
No.
"Okay. Can I suggest that you see me again in a few weeks, just to chat about it?"
"Um, okay, I'm ready for it, but it's going to be the same problem as, A, finding time."
Correct.
"- and B, if I can make an appointment -"
"Right, right."
I don't expect to have to wait half an hour.
Exactly.
"- or whatever, ""because it is -"
"Exactly. I'll tell you what a nice solution might be if you make an appointment first, and I'll give you an appointment at 8: 30."
That would be good.
"And the purpose of this visit will be to take a look at how you really feel, how you can move forward, and how you can somehow fit into a healthier lifestyle in the hectic work life you have."
I might take a look at my schedule to see if anything comes out of it.
Yes.
"-can be arranged, or I can give something away"
Yes.
"So I can come here and say, OK, I've looked at my schedule, I've looked at things."
Fine.
- whatever.
"Good, and see if you can fix it, and also think about what we have been talking about."
"Yes, of course."
Good stuff. Okay.
"Okay, thank you. Sorry, I'm a bit off."
"Well, I'm glad we found out and I think you'll feel better in the next few days."
"Oh, thank you to the doctor. I will just let it go for a few days quietly."
"Now that I have you here and we have a few minutes left, I would like to raise another issue: I have noticed that your blood pressure and weight have increased a little over the last few years. We didn't really have time to talk about it before, and I can perhaps offer some useful strategies. Would it be okay if we were to spend a few minutes discussing weight and health?"
"I know my weight is a problem, but every time I try to lose it, I win it back. I don't know what to do."
"I know how you feel. Weight management can be frustrating. Maybe we can just start figuring it out together, and I'll be here to help you overcome the challenges."
"Okay, thank you doctor, but I'm just worried about losing weight now because work is so busy and the kids take so much time."
"Yes, that's understandable, we both know there's a lot in weight management, but there's no need to figure it out today, especially because things are so busy for you at the moment. Maybe we could put our heads together and think about something small that fits sensibly into your life, and then we can take further steps when you're ready."
"Okay, that sounds great, so what should I do?"
"One of the things that plays a role in controlling weight and health is activity. Physical activity benefits the whole body. It is healthy for our joints, our stress levels and, above all, for weight management. Perhaps we could talk about some ways to add activity that fits our lives."
"I knew you would say that, but I don't have time in my schedule. I can't afford to go to the gym for an hour every day."
"I don't have an hour to go to the gym every day, but one of the great things about physical activity is that lots of it can be very helpful in any kind of activity, for example, some of the activities you enjoy."
I like to run.
Me too. Walking is a great exercise.
"Wait a minute, isn't walking too gentle to help you lose weight?"
"In fact, just a few minutes of walking is really healthy and worthwhile, and if you have time to do more, that's great. Walking is also great because you can do it anywhere, it doesn't have to be in the gym."
"Oh, wow, that sounds good. You know what? Remember, I have some time before I have to go back to work and see a beautiful park on the way here, maybe I can take a short walk after this appointment."
That sounds great.
"And you know what? I used to really like dancing, but I haven't done that in so long."
"Well, dancing is a great exercise, mainly because it's fun."
Hmm. And I know that my family would support me if I could just find a place where I could go dancing.
"Oh, that's great to hear your family are so supportive, and I bet there's a dance class somewhere near you or maybe even a dance fitness class in the gym."
"Yes, and you know what? I really like to try it out."
Would you like to do some research and try it out?
"I'm pretty excited about it, what else have you got?"
"Well, small steps can do a lot. Even things like occasionally using the stairs instead of the elevator or parking a little further from the door when you walk into a store can be ways to increase exercise in everyday life."
Mm-hmm. I can.
How about we start there and move on in a couple of weeks so we can see what happens and then maybe talk about some other strategies that could help.
"Diet, the D-word."
"What we eat is certainly important for weight and health, but just as we did today, we can talk about a few small steps that can fit into your life, and especially those that make you feel good."
"Yes, I like that. Okay, I make an appointment and start dancing right away, Doc."
This is great. I will see you soon.
"So, uh, tell me about the exercise."
"Well, erm, I've been to the gym a couple of times since we last spoke."
Do you have that?
I have.
That's fantastic.
"Yes, and actually my pants feel a little bit better. I'm very happy with it."
What else have you noticed but that your pants fit better?
"Um, I feel better."
Mm-hmm.
My back -
For my sake?
"Well, my back doesn't hurt nearly as much."
Wow.
"And, erm, but it seems like it's like that, um--but it's still hard. I'd like to go more often or I - I guess I just need to be a little bit more patient with myself because it's, er, I'm not, er, I'm not - I want to be able to spend more time in the gym, but right now it's about, not, um--Well, I think I need to build on that."
Mm-hmm. So what would you do - what would help you prepare for it? Spend more time there.
"Um, well, I guess just stick with it and don't get it wrong."
Mm-hmm.
"Like last week I only got there on Thursday during the week, -"
Mm-hmm.
It's been a frustrating week for the gym this way.
Mm-hmm.
"I was kind of busy with a few other things, but, um -"
Mm-hmm. But you made it - you made it one day.
I-I have -
-instead of zero days.
"Yes, and indeed I did it again on Saturday."
That's fantastic.
Yes.
"Even with that, you know, pretty awful schedule."
"Yes. It was a bit hectic, you know. And, uh - but I don't like it too much because there are all these younger guys who can lift a lot more weight than I can, or they can stay on the treadmill longer and it's a little daunting, you know. ""Because I don't know if you've noticed, I'm not a talker and they are. And it's a little disheartening to think about how much work it takes to get back there, you know, somehow."
So you want to be buffed?
"No, but, erm, when I'm not in the gym, and I'm my normal rational self, I realize that I'm, you know, way, way beyond the age at which I really want to do that, let alone spend the time it takes. But then, while I'm in the gym, and I see those smart young guys, you know, lifting a lot of weight and all that stuff, you know that -- I don't know, the urge to be buff comes up in me."
"Well, but at the moment it sounds as if the pants fit better."
Yes.
-really sounds like it gives you a good feeling about yourself and -
It is.
What other positive things did you notice about the exercise?
"Well, I've noticed that I - I've still got a lot of work to do on my diet. I've - I'd like to say that I've changed my diet, erm, by working out in the gym - but not much. I've gotten a bit better with it, but I'd like to do a lot more."
How did you get a bit better?
"Um, a little less junk food. Um, like sometimes when I feel like, ""Oh, I think I'm just going to go eat a candy bar,"" or something worthless, I actually have a second thought before I do it."
So you are on the second part of the thought. And what do you think - could make you actually do it if you wanted to?
"Well, I think, uh, when I really start to see some results in the gym, it's kind of, uh, I think the way it works in my head is when I've trained really hard and I - and I - say I've lost a pound this week."
Mm-hmm.
"- You know, and then when I look at this double or triple vertigo quad-decker with Sunday ice cream, you know that someone is eating, I would say, ""Wow, that would be about two hours on the treadmill."" Then - then that would probably be - The- that would stop me from ordering one of them."
"Oh, okay. The reward just wouldn't be worth that two-hour treadmill compared to that double fuzzy brown thing."
"Right, decadent - why do they include the word decadent in their diet?"
"'Because it's decadent, it's beautiful."
Okay.
"Yeah, yummy, so -"
"Okay. But it seems to be going so far, so well. I-I think, you know, I can, you know, er, I-I-am-pretty happy with who - how it's going to go. Um, I really am - I'm glad we talked about it last time because it was the impetus to let me go for the first time in a long, long time."
"So, Liz, what is something you want to change, or maybe that you are feeling two things right now?"
"Um, I really want to start training again, definitely be back, have a routine and just be healthy."
"Okay, and - why would you want to make that change?"
"Um, I'm sick of feeling the way I do. I'm kind of sluggish, especially with winter coming up, I think I want to have more energy."
Mm-hmm.
"Um, I don't like how my clothes fit or don't fit me."
Mm-hmm.
Except I don't feel comfortable.
"Yes. So you are not comfortable with the way your clothes fit, as you said."
Mm-hmm.
What are some of the reasons why it would be good for you to make this change?
"Um, I know sport is - in the past it has always made me feel good. I felt good in myself, and only in general, exercise, as I know, makes me feel good. I want to be a good example for my children. I want them to feel that it's a part of life."
Mm-hmm.
"So, I want - I really just want to get back into the routine."
So to get healthy - to feel healthy for yourself and to be a good role model for your children?
Yes.
"So if you decided to get more exercise into your everyday life, how would you do it?"
"Um, I don't know. I'd probably have to sit down with my husband and try to find a good time for me to be able to do what he would do with the kids at home, and I would do that, whether it's in the morning, in the evening, maybe at the weekend."
Mm-hmm.
Just to find the time or what works in our schedule.
"So it is this balance of doing something for yourself, but it sounds as if you do not want this schedule to have too much of an impact on the family routine."
"Right, yes."
"On a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is not important and 10 is very important, where would you rank the importance of doing more exercise?"
"Mm, I'd like to say a seven or an eight, that's so important to me."
"Okay, so why not five or six?"
Because I'm really sick of being overweight.
Mm-hmm.
"No, I just don't like being unhealthy. It doesn't make me feel good, so I'm motivated to change, it's easy to get there."
"So in summary, it is important that you do this: you start to feel lethargic, you do not feel healthy, and you know that you have other people in your family watching you, and you want to be a good role model for them so that they know that this will only be part of your life, your movement. But for you, you just have to deal with the logistics a little bit when you have to schedule time for yourself so that it doesn't interfere too much with your family."
"Exactly, yes."
"If you know that, what do you think you will do next?"
"Mm, I'll probably, I don't know, find out - now that it's still reasonably okay outside, I might pick out days where I'll go for a walk or a run, erm, maybe I'll look for a gym near the house so I know I can go there quickly, or maybe there'll be a day care center there, erm, yes, maybe I'll just start looking for it and find ways to do it first."
This is great. It sounds like you have a few options and instructions on how to do this.
Yes.
"I don't know, I just have a lot of difficulty losing the rest of the weight. Um, at the moment it doesn't matter how much I try to train, run or whatever, it doesn't matter how nothing else comes out."
"Right, so you've reached a plateau in your weight and despite all the things you're trying to increase your activity, it doesn't seem to work on the scales?"
"No, and I don't know what I'm doing wrong, because I keep trying the exercise, but nothing happens."
"Right. So you feel like you're turning your wheels, you're doing more sports and it doesn't show any results on the scale?"
Yes.
And you don't feel that good about it?
"No, and even when I get home, I go to the gym, and then I realize that nothing happens, and I come home and try to talk to my mom or even my dad about it, and no one cares."
"Er, so you feel like you're doing it all by yourself?"
Yes.
At home or do you think they will support you but not give you - they will not give you what you need?
"No, and my father in particular is right - not only does he not want to support me with this, but he also feels that I need to regain my weight."
"Oh, okay."
""
Tell me about it.
"It's like I'm losing weight, it's like I'm kind of disconnecting from my family, and he thinks I'm trying to shape myself to fit into this perfect American image, and I just want to be healthy, I just want to have a good body and he doesn't see it that way."
"Hello, Natalie, I'm Dawn."
"Hello, Dawn. Nice to meet you."
Nice to meet you too. Thank you for coming today.
Thank you for having me.
Yes. Tell me a little about yourself.
"So I'm, um, 28, and I moved to Arizona about six months ago. Um, I really enjoy spending time with my family and hanging out with friends whenever I can. Work keeps me pretty busy. Um, but I'm really, erm, trying to make a few changes to my diet and physical activity. I'm not really happy with where my weight is right now, and, er, so I thought it would be good to talk to you about some of those things."
"Yes, do you feel a little dissatisfied with your health patterns?"
"Yes. Um, I'm really starting to notice how I feel sluggish and just not - my mood has changed a lot as well, which I thought at first because it's getting colder outside, um, but I also think it might have something to do with my activity or lack of it, and also with the kind of food I eat."
"Okay, so do you feel a little less energy and know that in the past, if you were more active and ate differently, you had more energy?"
"Right. Yes. Especially in times when I am more active, I notice the biggest change in energy and mood."
Yes. Tell me more about those earlier times when you were active.
"Yeah. Um, well, I played sports in college, that kept me pretty busy, and that was really fun, um, and I think back now to so much that I would have stuffed myself into a 24-hour period, and I wonder how I did that, but I think it was because I was so physically active, um, I just had a lot more energy all day, mentally and physically, to, um, go to school full time and still meet up with friends and do all that stuff. Um, when I think back to that, it was probably the highlight of my life when I felt best physically, mentally it was that time."
"You had energy, and you were like the Energizer bunny, just keep going and go and go."
"Um, when I get home from work, I'm pretty exhausted, uh, it takes a lot for me to want to be physically active when I've spent all day staring at a computer and thinking and working. And so, uh, yeah, that was probably my biggest problem, uh, that's when work's over, I go home and I'm not really doing anything. Um, just trying to relax by watching Netflix or something else, right?"
"So now that you're working and having a career, your days are just as full, erm, and your energy level is not what it used to be. Whatever - do you have any ideas as to why that might have changed?"
"Um, well, I think part of it is that when I was in college, it wasn't a real option to go, like, I had to go to practice or I had to do these things because in a way that was my job that was paid for school, um, and now there's not the same commitment to other people or scholarship money anymore. So that's definitely shifted, um, but I-I feel like an urgency to go, it just doesn't seem like the step that's missing for me is actually going to the gym or being more active somewhere."
Right. So in the past it wasn't up to you if you had the choice to get physically active. Now it's up to you and - and you look back on the last few years and say: I want to do it differently.
Mm-hmm.
I want to be more physically active than I was before.
"Yeah, yeah, I think so. Um, that doesn't mean I want to run a marathon, but I think it would help me a lot to just have a better perspective on life, um, and a better energy - if I take up any kind of activity."
And you've noticed a mood-brightening effect of exercise.
Mm-hmm.
"Tell me more about it: What do you notice on the days when you are physically active, specifically in your mood?"
"I'm just happier and more optimistic, and I think even my outlook is more positive, so if I'm sitting in traffic and not physically active, I'll probably grumble about it, but if I'm sitting in traffic, and that was me, I just have a different view of things and I already feel like I've accomplished something that day, so it just kind of helps with that ripple effect into my day where I like to do more things."
"Yes, you feel more accomplished and less irritated by the small things."
"Mm-hmm. Yes, exactly."
"You came to Arizona six months ago, you're trying to find new rhythms and patterns for yourself. You look back over the last few years, and in college you were really active because you were an athlete, and now it's more up to you to make that choice of physical activity, and you discover that, erm, not being active has affected your energy level and your mood, and that's something you're looking for more, both energy and a mood boost."
"Yes. And then also to, um, like I said, I'm not completely satisfied with my weight, um, so I hope that it would make a difference there and maybe help me, er, if my type of activity is solved or improves, then my diet, maybe go with it and get better."
Yes. Tell me more about your weight concerns. When did you start to feel dissatisfied with your body?
"Er, probably about three or four months ago. Er, yeah, just my clothes started to sit tighter, which wasn't so comfortable, and, er, yeah, just not really super happy with my appearance, which has never really been an issue in my life so far, er, in my life. I was usually pretty okay with that, and then in the last three months I just felt, uh, like I had a much more negative outlook on it."
"Mm-hmm. Okay, so it sounds like a kind of vicious circle and - and maybe the lack of physical activity has made you less confident in yourself. I wonder if that's part of the puzzle, too, since you mentioned that it was a big difference from what happened in the past."
"Yes, I think - I think the activity piece and then the food I eat is not that great, so it kind of does the same thing, I think, with my appearance or the way I look at myself."
"Okay. So until a few months ago, you had a pretty strong self-confidence, a pretty strong body image and, um, you hope to somehow get back to the place where you feel good."
Mm-hmm.
Great.
"I mean, I've worked really hard. Sometimes I can't come home for dinner, so I have to go out for dinner at Applebee's or something - but she seems to have a bigger problem, I really don't know what the big deal is."
"Okay, so what I'm hearing is that you don't feel your health is bothering you right now, do you?"
I-I-feel-good.
Okay.
"I mean, my work is really labor intensive, so I usually work out most of the day in the hot sun, so I usually sweat out as much as bad things I put into my system, so -"
Okay. Have you noticed that you have gained weight or something like that?
"Well, a bit, but nothing like that. I'm not a blogger, I'm not bloated or anything."
Okay. Okay. And how about a visit to the doctor?
"Well, maybe I went to the doctor last year for a physical examination, but - I mean, everything seemed to be fine, so -"
Okay. But do you feel good?
Yes.
"Okay. Um, and so what I hear is that you - you feel your wife might overreact to it, uh?"
"I know that she loves me and I know that she wants me, er, she wants me to live long and be healthy, but sometimes, especially when you work hard, like eating out in these places, you feel a little better in your situation."
"Sure. Sure. Okay. Um, and so I would like to give you some information about, um, maybe obesity or diabetes, if you are interested or open to it."
Sure. [incomprehensible 00: 01: 33]
Okay.
"So I hear again that your overarching goal really is not to give up on the things you would like, but to reduce how much you have."
"Yes, I think so."
"So I would like to ask you some kind of scaling question on this issue, because I hear that it feels really important to you that you are high on the scale - on the high end of the scale."
Yes.
"So I'm going to ask the question like this, on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is not confident at all, and 10 like ""I'm very, very confident,"" where would you now put yourself on a scale of confidence to start this new plan?"
Right now I'm probably -
Mm-hmm.
-Will say a six.
A six.
"But I know if I go home and see the food, it's probably going to drop to a four."
"Okay. All right, so let's talk about it, um, so let's just assume we'll be at a four."
Right?
Okay?
I guess.
So why are you with a four and not even a lower number? Why are you not like a zero or a one?
"Because I have wanted to do this for years, I want to"
Okay.
- since I started to become aware of my body.
Okay.
"As always since I started as a teenager, it was always a goal of mine, especially ""because all my friends play football and I liked it."""
Er-huh.
"hike, and are super thin, but really healthy and active."
Okay.
"And I'm just like, well, I'm not."
Okay.
"But I want to be like that - I don't want to be as thin as a stick, but I really want to be as healthy and really active."
Okay.
And you know how to look beautiful.
"Okay, all right."
I want to be able to look beautiful.
Okay. So what would help to boost that confidence? Whatever - because that sounds like what we really need to focus on. What will help you feel more confident?
I don't even really know.
Mm-hmm.
"-Honestly. Like, I mean, I know that I have to keep telling myself."
Mm-hmm.
- that is what you want - that you have wanted -
Er-huh.
For years.
Er-huh.
"Like, you can do it. Because how -"
Okay.
"I know I can do it, just as I can do anything."
All right.
I can do anything.
All right.
"I know that, but it's hard to get to the point where you can't"
Okay.
- do something.
"Well. Well, if it's fine, just for a moment, let's put aside the change in eating habits and look at another time in your life when there was something you really wanted to achieve and that you did. And what's it about you - what was it about you? What strengths did you bring to the table that enabled you to tackle something that felt like a challenge and enabled you to succeed?"
"Hello, Liz. Well, thank you for meeting me today."
Sure.
"So what do you want to change or, er, work towards?"
"Well, [sighs] I've been thinking about training lately. I really want to start training again. It was in my head, I know I need to do it. It's just the motivation to do it."
And you have been talking about it a lot lately.
Mm-hmm.
"- the feeling that this is something you need to do soon because, um, often, you just talk a lot. And then there's no action. And if you really want to see results, I think it's something that needs to be done. And, you know, stop being lazy with it, and just do it."
"Well, I don't know if I'm really lazy. I think it's just that I have a busy schedule."
Yes.
"I just need to find the time to do it. And, yes, I might lack a bit of motivation, but I think it's more timing and trying to insert it."
"And that sounds like a lot of excuses to me. So I feel like you told me beforehand that you have a gym membership, so I think that's something you just have to put in your schedule, so for you to really see results that you want, I think you have to go about three or four times a week and really fit into that hour of training, er, on a daily basis."
"But I think part of the problem is that I don't have time three to four times a week - three to four times a week, or even an hour. I mean, hour is a long time, because if I train for an hour, it means I go away from home to get there."
Mm-hmm.
"I mean, it's not just one hour, it's realistically two hours."
"And if it takes two hours, then it will take two hours. Again, if you want to see the results you want, you have to start, and you have to start now."
"Well, oh, okay."
"Well. Um, I'm looking forward to talking to you tomorrow and I hope you can tell me that you went to the gym."
Okay.
Thank you.
"Hello, Mrs. Smith. I'm Denise. I'm the social worker here at the clinic who works with Dr. Fields and the rest of the team. And, erm, I know you were here today to see Dr. Fields, and I - I just wanted to let you know that I usually work with people who are like you - have situations that are similar to you and who have come home from rehab. And, erm, so I'd like to find out a little bit if you're okay with that, how you've been doing since you came home."
Pretty good.
Yes?
"Yeah. Um, I'm glad to be there."
Yes. What are you really happy about?
"Er, I'm glad to see my dog, he's very cute and it just feels good to be home."
Yes.
"Yes. And my garden is coming, and my neighbors have something - it's good. It's good to be home."
"I know, I understand that it was really like that - that was your goal. That was a really important thing for you to be able to come home and it sounds like you really enjoyed parts of it - and I know you went there - both the physiotherapy and the tai chi and how is that going?"
"Well, erm. I - I didn't make it - went to physiotherapy this week, and that - or Tai Chi, actually."
"So I wonder if something happened that made you not go. You're looking down a little, erm, down."
"Yes. Well, erm. Actually, I-I had a little half-fall, I didn't fall down, I didn't fall down completely, but I-I did - I think I still had the wobbles and I was hoping that physiotherapy and Tai Chi would take me further than it is, and I-I still don't have the balance. So I think that maybe I pushed too hard, that maybe I should go back, you know, and somehow I shouldn't try so hard to keep moving."
MM. So you worked really hard.
Yes.
- through this whole thing you worked really hard to get home.
Yes.
"And you - you have continued to work hard, both in physiotherapy and Tai Chi, and you have looked after your house and done all these things."
Yes.
"And you've had this fall or half-fall, and you feel like maybe - maybe you've put too much pressure?"
"Yes, yes."
Yes.
"So I am-I-I-cut back, and I-I don't know if I should really continue Tai Chi, because it is very demanding."
"Yes, yes, it's a lot of work."
"Er, it's all very well - but, um, yes."
What are you worried about?
That I will fall again.
Mm-hmm.
"I'm really going to fall and hurt myself, and that way, if I don't move as much, there's less chance of me becoming it."
"Yes, yes, yes. And - so that you do not want to hurt yourself."
No.
And what are your worries about it - it doesn't sound like you - you feel like you've hurt yourself this fall.
"No, I didn't - it was just scary and it was like a signal that maybe I was doing too much."
Mm-hmm.
Yes.
Yes. And what happens if you get hurt or something happens?
"Well, if - if I lose my balance and fall over - I really hurt something, and then - I couldn't be home anymore, and that's not what I want. I want to stay home. So I want to do what I need to do to stay home."
And it feels like the only way to stay really safe and not fall is to do nothing to hide in some way.
"Yes. (laughs) Yes, you put it very well, hunker down."
"Yes, yes."
"I-I, you know, not so extreme, but yes, I think - I think maybe, er, yes, I was-too-strong-pushing."
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
"And I'm not sure about Tai Chi any more. I think physical therapy, I can understand that, but I'm not so sure about Tai Chi."
Yes. So physical therapy is possible - you can still see somehow that it helps you build up your strength.
Yes.
- would probably have helped you to break through your fall this time.
"Right, right."
"Er, I wonder what you remember - what Dr. Fields said about Tai Chi in relation to falls. Did she talk to you about it?"
"She said that they did studies and they found that it was really preventative. I think she - I forget the percentage, but yes, she was really excited and she does it herself."
Yes.
Yes.
"Yes. So you feel a little cheated, as if it's not like, ""Look, and I did that, I did my Tai Chi, and all of a sudden, I - here, look at that, I fall."""
"That's a strong word, isn't it, ""she revealed."" Um, wow. A little bit, but I know I know it's true. I mean, my friend who does Tai Chi, she loves it. Maybe it's just not for me, you know."
Correct.
""
"So you're just starting to think a little bit about whether it might be useful or not, and, you know, it really depends on what works for you, and what-wh-what you decide will help you stay safe, and I'd love to work with you, as Dr. Fields would, to help you develop a plan that will help you feel as safe as possible in your home."
Correct.
- and to keep you there and to feel safe.
Yes.
What do you think of this?
"Absolutely, that means - because I don't - now I am - I feel it -"
Yes.
"- really a bit scared, what if I fall over and - and nobody comes and I lie there for two days, you know. Maybe I heard about it."
"Yes, right."
"So, erm, ""because I'm alone."
"Yes, yes."
""
So it really kind of strikes you that you're alone there and that this could happen and that you don't know what to do.
Yes.
"What do you think about it? What have you heard that others have done, or what are - what are - what thoughts do you have?"
"Well, I think there are some things that could be done - I know people who live in a dormitory, they have a cord that they can pull, but how do they get the cord? Um, is there anything else - anything I could do just to communicate when - if -"
"Yes, yes."
- if something happens?
"Yes, yes. I know what worked for a lot of people - the people I worked with have something similar - it's called a lifeline and they can wear it around their necks and it's plugged in and - so if you need help, you can push the button."
I think I've seen something like that on TV.
Mm-hmm.
Does it really work?
It really works.
"""Because you know they sell so much stuff on TV, it's like you can [speak out]"
Right. Right.
"It's crazy, it's crazy."
"No, it's something of which there are a few different, er, you know, a few different products out there, but it-it does-it can really help, er, and-and it kind of gives you that sense of security that you have at your fingertips."
Yes. I do think I feel a little scared.
Mm-hmm.
-You know that this is happening and -
Yes.
"So, yes, it's probably a signal to make a few changes."
Mm-hmm.
"As if I don't want to go back to the hospital, do I? I really don't. Do I?"
We will work with you to help you stay at home and be safe for as long as possible.
Yes.
"So what do you think will it take, er, because you're the one who really knows how you're feeling in the house and how you feel about your safety. What do you think? The lifeline is a possibility, that's something you can consider."
I definitely will - I definitely want to.
""
I definitely want to.
"Mm-hmm. What do you think, does it take to feel safe?"
"Well, I - maybe she - when I first came home, they had someone to show me a few things in the house, but maybe a refresher on it, and they told me to exercise and - er, I guess I could - maybe support, maybe I'm looking for - maybe a buddy or something, somehow be reminded of it. I feel a little bit, you know, I moved and things felt more positive, it's kind of like two steps forward and -"
"Yes, yes."
"- one step back, but now it's one step forward and three steps back. [laughs]"
Mm-hmm.
"My daughter is very good and she calls me, but you know, she lives in Seattle, she lives."
Yes.
- far away.
Yes.
I don't want to impose anything on my neighbours or friends.
So they would like a bit more support.
Mm-hmm.
- and maybe a bit more connection -
Yes.
"-that-that, erm, that has to happen. Do you want some suggestions?"
Yes.
"Um, so one of the things that we have here, we have - we can get some cases - what they call case management services and that could be someone who comes to your home and helps you figure out some of the things that need to be done, as you just said, give you a little refresher in terms of home security -"
Correct.
"- and, er, and - and maybe it also helps you to organize and connect to other services that could be out there or do things, um, like that. I don't know."
"Yes, that would be good. Do you think I should try to return to Tai Chi?"
"Yes. I wanted to say the other thing that I would say - that I would consider it because the Senior Centre, and I know that you were really active in the Senior Centre before that -"
"Yes, great place."
"- and I wonder if you feel that there is support there. You have a lot of activities in the Senior Centre that - and I don't know what was in Tai Chi, what that might be - not only serve the purpose of the exercise, but really help with some of that support."
"Yes. I guess I've gone to extremes in some way. I tend to do that. [chuckles] Yes. So, keep moving?"
"Yes. It sounds so crazy, doesn't it? Just like what I hear from you when it feels like it's inside, it feels like it's unsafe to move."
Yes.
"And yet, we know that we cannot create perfect safety, but we know that the more you move and the more active you remain, the less likely you are to fall and the safer you will become."
Really?
Yes.
"Oh, okay."
Can't stop it all?
Er-huh.
- but we can make it less likely.
"Okay. Okay. Okay. I-I am ready to start over, so to speak."
Mm-hmm.
"Yes, it's scary."
Yes. Needs a lot. Needs a lot. And you are the only one who can know what you are prepared to process this fear for.
"Well, I'm ready to process my fears and difficulties of being in my little house with my little dog and my little garden. I've been there a long time - since my husband and I got married, and that's where we lived, and I don't want to give it up yet."
"Mm-hmm. And that is a strong enough motivator for you and gives you enough single-mindedness that you are willing to push through that fear, that even though it is there and that, that sense of freedom and freedom."
Yes.
concern for safety.
Yes.
Yes.
"-I am, and I feel like I have some help."
"Yes. Yes. Well, we can definitely talk about it when you come back in."
Okay.
"-again, and-and-"
So am I a baby?
Not at all.
Okay.
Not being a baby - that's a pretty normal process.
Really?
"Absolutely. It is an absolutely normal thing to feel that, and especially when you have suffered and are suffering from something, the stroke and trying to rehabilitate yourself and find a way to come home and go through the wobbles, that is perfectly normal."
Really?
"Yes. And indeed you did - you really showed me a lot of strength and courage anyway, because you persevered and worked through, and not everyone does. And you found a way to come home, and you really seem to feel obliged to stay at home. You - you have a lot of strength there to work with."
"Thank you, thank you."
And we can work together to make sure that is the case - and I know that Dr Fields is very interested in that as well - we can work together to do what we can to keep you there.
"Well, and she's not going to put me back in the hospital?"
Not yet.
Not yet? [laughs] Okay. Yes. I was kind of - I-I was kind of hesitant to tell you -
Mm-hmm.
""
Mm-hmm.
"-that, but, erm, erm, I'm kind of glad I did it. I'm very glad I did it."
"I am really glad that you have done so, and I really appreciate it, because that is the only way we can work together."
Yes.
- to make you feel safer and I hope that you go home today with a feeling of security.
Yes. So the clerk will be able to come and refresh himself.
Mm-hmm.
Me?
We will cast a spell over you.
And - and this is - yes.
Mm-hmm.
"I mean, that alone, knowing that I have communication that I have - that was my biggest fear, that something -"
Mm-hmm.
"-would happen, and I would have no one -"
""
- any way to tell anyone.
"Well, you have some good plans, and we will look at them and make sure they happen."
Okay.
All right. Thank you.
"Oh, hello Scott."
Hello.
"Um, we talked a little bit earlier and you said you wanted to talk about sport."
I do.
What's wrong with that?
"Well, I just can't seem to get back to the gym. I don't want to - I used to train quite a bit, and in the last, I don't know, a couple of years I've done right - I've stopped going. I was busy, and now I'm out of the habit, and I really do, I don't know, I feel like I need to go back."
"Well, I mean, I think you might have to sit down and write down a list of reasons why you need to go back to the gym, and then write down ideas on the other side of the list about what will help you get there."
Okay. Um. All right. Um.
Which gym do you belong to?
"Er, I belong to the Sports Fitness Center."
Okay. And how far is it from your house?
Just a few miles.
"Just a few miles. Mm. So you know, you could like to ride a bike or walk there, and it would be too [incomprehensible 00: 01: 12]."
"If I went that far, I probably wouldn't even have to go to the gym, would I?"
"This is a good idea for the cardiovascular system, but also for your, um, weight lifting, that [inaudible 00: 01: 32] [crosstalk]."
[inaudible 00: 01: 33] Training.
"Yes, yes."
It would be important.
"Yes. Why-why do you want that? What do you want to do with it? You want to look different, don't you?"
"Well, I-I-I-would feel better. Mine-I-could wear more of my clothes. I've grown around the middle and I want to, er, you know, get back to where I was, you know, get into a 34, 36 waist, you know."
Okay.
I-I feel more comfortable - I feel better. I think that's the main thing.
"Okay. Yes, because your health is really more important to me than your appearance. I mean, don't get me wrong, I understand what you're saying, but you know, it would be great to put on those jeans again, but -"
"Yes, yes. It-it-it-I-am - I am not getting younger than me [incomprehensible 00: 02: 18]"
"Mm-hmm. Well, I think you know what to do. You've done it before."
Yes.
Yes. Only a matter of time - you just have to do it.
I need to win time.
Yes.
I need to win time.
"Yes. And that could mean, you know, like giving up an hour of sleep, getting up an hour earlier in the day and going and then doing it. That's what I do."
"Yes, OK."
Yes.
All right.
"So the next time I see you, you know, that's what I want you to do is get up an hour earlier and, um -- you know, because getting healthier is more important than sleeping, you know. I mean, I know sleep is important, but -- And then bring back that list that we talked about."
Okay.
Okay?
Okay.
"All right, so see you next week."
Okay. Very good. Thank you.
All right. All right. Bye.
"Thank you for coming, tell me what has happened since we last spoke."
"Well, I, erm, I got an interview. Um -"
"Wow, that's so great."
"Yeah, but I couldn't go, uh, because my kids, I didn't have anyone to watch them. And, uh, you know, so that was kind of a game over. I just had to cancel the interview and that's a pity because it was a really, really good job, but I don't know."
They sound disappointed.
"Well, because it is - it is, you know, I didn't really have a choice. I think I have to do it - I have to make sure my kids are looked after first. And, uh, you know, I'm worried that it's going to continue."
There will always be times when you miss chances.
Yes.
"Mm-hmm, okay. Well, tell me, um, on a scale of one to ten, how important is it for you to get a job?"
"Um, it's about 10, because yes, I mean, I'm the only one supporting my kids and, um, you know, it's just that what I get from welfare is just not cutting it, so I really need to have a job and soon."
Yes. You are-you-are-you-are-it.
Yes.
You have to take care of your children.
Mm-hmm.
"Um, and tell me on a scale of one to ten, how confident are you that you're going to get a job?"
"I mean, right now I think I'm about three. I just feel like, you know, even if I'm able to get an interview and get childcare, you know, when I turn up, I have this resume that I have - it's not impressive and it has all these job gaps, and I'm not as educated as other people who get into the same job, so I just feel like, uh, I don't know that I'm fit to work."
"So it sounds as though the issue of childcare has got in the way, so it would be really helpful to find something that would work for you."
Yes.
And then it sounds like you don't feel great about your resume and your experiences.
"Yes. Yes, because it's so limited and I wasn't in work, and even when I was working, I mean, it's not, I don't know, it's not the stuff that I feel can lead to the job I want now."
Okay. What do you want - what do you want?
"I just want something that's stable and where I can be, you know, even if my kids are in daytime childcare, that I can be at home every night and spend time with them and, erm, you know, you really like getting something where I just make good money and - and I don't have to worry about money all the time."
"Yes. Yes. So if you had consistent work, it would change your life in many ways."
"Yes, that would be huge."
"Mm-hmm. It would provide the income you need, and you wouldn't worry so much."
Yes. And it would be nice to just know what I'm doing and just have my routine.
Right. So you know every day where you are going.
Yes.
"Okay. And you know what happens for a day, for a week."
"Right. Well, it would be good if I knew, you know, that my children are also taken care of."
Yes.
- so I don't worry about them while I'm at work.
Right. Yes. Because you are the kind of parent who wants to make sure your children are doing well.
Correct.
"Yes. Er, so tell me what it would take to get you to like a five in confidence, to be a bit more confident when it comes to getting a job?"
"Well, I think the priority would be to have the opportunity to do the interviews."
"Okay, yes."
"Er, so chi- you know, cares, has a bit of childcare, having-"
Mm-hmm.
"- to have someone I trust, someone I can call when I know I have an interview."
Yes. Because you definitely have to go to an interview to get the job.
Correct.
"So if you have looked after this part, reliable childcare would definitely help."
Yes.
What else would get you to a five?
"Um, I just wish I had more experience or, erm, more education. It seems like everyone has a college education and I don't have that on my resume."
Okay.
I am asked about training and further education and -
"Mm-hmm, mm-hmm."
"- Um, you know, I just, it, as soon as I asked about it, I just feel like I'm not good enough."
Okay.
- because I don't have that.
"So yes, if you had something on your CV that revolves around education, maybe a certificate for a field you are interested in, then you would be proud of yourself."
"Yes. Well, something that I could talk about in the interview as well. You know, even if I were some kind of certification that I could say I could talk about, you know, with confidence."
"Mm-hmm. Okay. Whatever - do you have any ideas about what areas you might be interested in to get more education, more training?"
"I mean, I think I just don't really know what it's going to be because I need a job now, so I'm not really sure."
Like what happens the fastest.
"Right. I almost feel that this is more important than what interests me, you know, because I feel like I'm not going to go back to school for four years now."
"Okay, and if so, it sounds like you're doing something you really want to do quickly, like a short certificate."
"Yes or something - yes, something that I could acquire right away that would, you know, put me in some sort of job now, even if it's not my long-term goal or, you know, my career - just gets me into something and then I can always focus on that."
"Yes, something like a short-term transition to something else."
Yes. Great. Exactly.
But that would be stable and would pay off well?
Mm-hmm.
"Okay, and allow yourself whatever you can afford."
"Yes, because even these jobs don't feel accessible to me at the moment. They seem, you know, like if- maybe if I was better at the computer or you know."
"Okay, so does it help to acquire computer skills?"
"Yes. I think so - I think so, because I can't - I don't really have anything on my CV that is mentioned -"
The technology.
Yes.
"Mm-hmm. Okay. Whatever and so far sounds like it's really important to get a job right now and you really need the money and you really need to take care of your kids and it sounds like you have some ideas on how to get to those job interviews, and then when you're at the job interview you'll have more confidence in your skills, er, you're going to have a child - reliable childcare certainly sounds very important."
Yes.
"Er, just like maybe doing some kind of certificate or getting some courses and training in computers?"
"Yes, that would be great."
Okay.
That would be great.
"What would you do next, you think?"
"Well, find the childcare resources -"
"Okay, okay."
- seems to be - seems to be -
This is a priority.
"The priority ""because I can't even do an interview without that."
Yes.
"And then, er, I mean - I guess I'm going into some kind of training program that, you know, is short."
Yes.
"- as if there might be a weekend, I mean -"
"Hi, Hannah. Nice to meet you."
Hello.
So I understand that you were referred to me by your GP because you had some anxiety disorder.
"Yeah. Um, yeah, I guess it kind of - it kind of started like five, six years ago."
Okay.
"Um, it's escalated a bit. Um, I just moved out recently, um, from my parents ""life. So just a bit worse, I think."
Okay. Is this the first time you leave home?
"Yes, I am - yes. It's actually the first time, yes. Um, I went a few years ago. I just thought it would be easier to stay at home, so."
"Okay, so it was a pretty big step and a big change and it sounds as though that was the reason you went to your GP."
Yes.
So how did that change things for you?
"Um, I don't know, it's kind of, I didn't really tell anyone, so I mean, it made it better in its sense. I feel, hopefully, it's like that, it's like that - it's going to help, but I don't know. I don't like to think that I'd have to like to do that. I never thought I'd want to be the kind of person that actually needs to go and get help if that makes sense."
Okay. How do you feel to be here today?
"I don't know, hopefully it will help."
"Okay, so you'd say, you're a little worried about today."
Yes.
"Okay. So I guess, just back to the question of why you went to the GP and how you got here today, so it sounds like you've been scared for a few years. Um, but you just recently moved out of your home for the first time and, um, and that's what made you go to the GP. How did that change things? What were things like after you moved out?"
"Um, I thought they were better, but ""because I thought I had to be somehow independent, and I guess, actually much worse. So I am - I just stay in the house a lot. I don't have friends or anything. I mean, my family comes to visit a little bit, but it's not - I don't know. It's kind of scary because I was just like that - it was just supposed to end the flight on my own, which I always thought I'd like to, but I don't really like it."
Okay. So what other difficulties did you have?
"Um, I mean, I'm a photographer. Um, so I'm kind of - it's kind of kept me from getting work, my fear, and because every time there's an opportunity to, er, interact with people, I tend to just turn them down. So it was kind of making things difficult in that regard and uh, just kind of wise friends and everything. I just kind of feel more and more lonely, so it's kind of kept me from making friends and, you know, liking relationships and stuff like that."
"Okay. So you said that, um, your difficulties get in the way of doing certain things. So it's them, they prevent you from doing a certain kind of work, and as a freelance photographer, I think that can be kind of a problem, and they hinder you, or you feel like it hinders you, er, socially. You're not able to make new friends and meet new people."
"Yeah, yeah. Um, it was kind of easier when I was at home because obviously I mean, I was my parents, so it's okay, but you know, they would, I would go to places where, um, or I would have people there, but more and more I just find myself in a crowd. I mean -- I went out for coffee with my friends like two weeks ago and all the time I just kind of wanted to go home. So I don't want to, I just don't want it - I don't want it to happen. I don't want to lose everybody."
"So you kind of worry about how, where this is going to lead."
"Um, yeah."
So you said you first noticed the fear about five or six years ago.
Yes.
So they would have been about 19 years old.
Yes.
And what was going on at that time?
"Er, I guess I had finished school about a year before. Er, and I mean, I-I've always been a little bit shy, um, at school, but it was never, um, as if it didn't affect things as much as it has in the last few years, I think. It just started when I - like my friends went to university, and, I don't know, I felt like I was expected to move out or do something, and then it just kind of escalated. I just stop going to parties, or I would just say no to invitations or I don't know, I thought my job would help because I mean, I love it."
What kind of work is the most difficult for you in your job?
"I guess if it's like that - I have to work with other people somehow. Um, I don't like that. It's like trying to do an event or something where there's a lot of people, not just photographers, but actually, you know, when I like to be with people I don't know, I kind of say, you know, I mean, I want to do it, but it's just scary, so I just don't do it."
"So I think, tell me a little bit more about what happens then. So maybe we'll focus on an invitation to work with a group of people, er, you know, it's going to involve, er, taking photos with - with a group of people, and you're going to have to have social interaction."
"Um, just, I mean, I get really hot and sweaty, and I don't - I feel like everyone's kind of looking at me and thinking I'm just that stupid, and I feel like they're all going to stare and think I just can't do my job, and I'm just an idiot, and I mean, they're going to think I just look like a weirdo and I'm just trying -- I mean, I'm just kind of just trying to get myself out of the situation or just focus on something else, so I like to shoot shots where it's just me and the camera's causing me -- then I can just focus all my attention on it instead of, you know, having to be with other people."
"Okay. It sounds like you have a lot of thoughts going through your head, then at the point where you get this invitation, and you think, ""People are going to look, people are going to stare, people are going to think I'm a weirdo."" So there's a lot about what you're thinking - what others are thinking, people are going to think."
"Um, just makes me feel like an idiot, makes me feel like I shouldn't even bother to try anymore. I should just go home and I right--I think I just don't want to be in that situation. I just feel like everyone else is doing well and they're normal and I'm just the freak, that's not how normal things are done and -"
Okay. Can you give me an example of a current situation? Maybe we can focus on that.
"Er, like a work situation or fair?"
"Yes, the time when you might have done a job with some people and felt the social anxiety you describe, that was a kick."
"Yeah. I did a job where it was kind of a nature thing and I had to work with a lot of different people. Um, and, um, when they told me about the job, I thought it was going to be good. I thought it was just going to be a couple of other photographers, but there were actually people and, you know, I was photographing people in the trees and stuff. And I guess - they were asking me to, uh -"
It's quite interesting: was it a fashion shoot or something?
"Yes. Yes. It was a fashion thing. I think it was for some sort of - I'm not sure if it was a campaign or something, but it was -"
Okay.
"Yeah, it was, yeah, it was really cool, but I find it - found it really hard to try to focus on it because I was like that - I kind of felt really anxious and -"
So it wasn't what you expected?
No.
How long ago was that?
That was two weeks ago.
"Okay, so it was only recently."
Yes.
So what were the thoughts that you had in your head that day when you found yourself in this situation?
"I felt really - just kind of hot. I couldn't really breathe and I just felt like I just wanted to get out, and I really, really hard, just trying to focus, and just, you know, holding the camera and just not thinking about anything, but I just felt like everyone was looking at me and liking me when they say ""action"" and they're trying to get me to start and I just felt like everyone just thought I was really stupid and I shouldn't have been there and -"
"I can tell you that you get a little anxious, even if you only think about that day."
Yes.
"Okay. So you're describing a lot to me there. So you're saying that you, you were kind of hot and sweaty, you said you held the camera."
Yes.
"W-what was, you mean, you're trying to hide behind it somehow, right?"
"I was just trying to focus on it. I just thought if I could just hold it really tight, it would be right - I don't know. I would just kind of get through it and just be able to concentrate."
So you hold the camera very tight.
Yes.
W-Why was that? Why was it helpful?
"Because I felt really hot and red and I just thought, at least if I can do it right - I don't know. It sounds weird, but I just tried to keep my hands still. ""Because my hands were kind of sweaty and shaking like a load, and I could just tell everyone that they were looking and could see them, and I just thought if I could hold on to it, it wouldn't be so remarkable, but -"
"Okay. Okay. So it sounds like a lot of thoughts were going through your head. Um, you said you were worried that everyone was looking at you. What other thoughts were there in your head?"
"Just--I was just stupid and it was just real--it really felt like everyone was just staring and just thinking that I - just like - I felt like everyone was looking at me and just, they could say it. And then I just thought about what she was doing?"
You could say what -
I was really sweaty and just -
"Oh, that was all they could see."
Yes.
Okay.
"Yeah, erm, I tried to wear black, so that kind of tries to cover it up and just so many layers, so they can't say, but, I mean, my hands as they were shaken so. I was really red and just wish I wasn't there."
"So, I mean, you've described it to me a little bit, but if you think about how you look that day, how would you say, how would you think, how do you look?"
"I just think it was very stupid and, like, I think my face was really red. I felt it reddening and I knew that I was probably sweating and shaking, as if my hands were definitely really shaking. Um, and far and wide - it was like definitely really noticeable. Everyone could definitely see it."
"Okay, and what did you do - how did you try to hide it or hide it?"
"Um, well, I tried to grab the camera again, just look down, just try not to do anything weird or - ""Because they could probably say I was weird anyway, but hopefully usually - I just tried to focus and look down, not try to look at anyone as if I wasn't kind-hearted - and just kind of deal with it as well as I could, but -"
So you avoided looking at the people. It sounds as if you had worn black in the preparation anyway.
"Yes, no, I always do it, even when it's really hot or I'm just wearing a lot of layers and just ""because otherwise I'm really sweating and people would like it, so."
"Okay, and how did it end?"
"Um, well, it went on like that for about an hour, and then, um, people went, um, after every shoot, people go out for a drink just to celebrate that we did it. I would do it right - I went home straight away, just got in my car and went home. I just didn't want to be around them, especially after they saw I was weird, and I just wanted to get home right away."
Okay.
"Something clicked, I'd had a pile of drinks and, er, and I knew I'd botched it."
How did you know you were being bungled?
"I was in the same place when I got home and swallowed a couple of these pills, it was the same business as and I wanted to stay there. I wanted to stay right there, and I just felt like I had ruined everything. You know, Erin is using the phone now, and he called me the next day and it was, uh, great, but I was kind of ashamed of myself, and I don't want to feel like that again."
"Was it that something happened, er, where you put something at risk that was really important to you? Was it what it was about, er, when you say you feel guilty, er, you feel bad when you phone Erin?"
"Yeah, I think that's what I mean, yeah, yeah. Because you know, I mean - I mean, I could have stayed, I could have got, I could have been absolutely hammered and I could have done it every night for the rest of the week."
So you saw yourself jeopardizing something that was important to you.
"But I don't know if I stopped because I knew I had to stop, or because it was exactly where I wanted to stay, you know?"
"Here you are actually, three months later, three long months, as you say, um, and things have gone really well, um, you even get a little -"
"They're better, yes."
"Yes. Well, and then you get that kind of, I don't know if it felt like a green light or a yellow light, it went from red to warning, you could see your kids, and that was something you really worked for."
"Yes, yes."
"Well, I want to thank you for coming to me today. Um, I understand from the conversation with your adviser that you have a lot on your plate, you have a lot to do. Can you tell me something about that?"
"Well, erm, I have a two-year-old son, and then I work full-time as a server in a restaurant, and recently I started going back to the evening class, so you know, just the combination of all of that, you know. I-I've been feeling really stressed lately."
"Yes, I could see it. Er, may I ask you, are you also a single mother?"
Yes.
"You are a single mother raising a two-year-old, working full-time and going back to school. What do you think we should focus on most today?"
"Well, I told the consultant that I think childcare is probably my biggest issue at the moment."
Okay. Can you tell me something about that?
"Yes. Um, yes, my mother usually watches my son, but lately it's kind of become a problem. You know, she likes it when she steps back at the last second, so I had to drop by work a couple of times. I've had to miss classes a couple of times, so it's just stressful to think about whether I'll be able to do these things or not."
"Okay. So I hear you say that the situation with your mother is not ideal. You actually missed lessons at some point and you had to lose a few shifts as well, and that's problematic."
"Yes, exactly."
"Okay. Er, apart from your mother, is there anyone else who can help you with childcare?"
"Um, yeah, I have a sister, but I don't really trust her to watch my son, and I don't really know that many people do that - the only thing that comes to my mind, I have this one neighbor who stepped in and helped once when my mom got out. She - she actually has, er, a three-year-old daughter, so you know, kind of worked."
Okay.
"Um, I don't really know her very well, but I mean, she seems to be nice and I think she did a pretty good job that night."
Hmm. So what I hear from you is that this neighbor was supportive when you really needed her.
Yes.
"At the last minute you stepped in. Er, when you picked up your son, you had no concerns and he seemed happy?"
Yes.
"Okay. Let's pursue this neighbor a bit. Um, people like this, I like to think of them as natural resources, but I know for a lot of people that the main problem with, er, child care is affordability."
Yes.
Have you thought about whether you can afford to pay someone to watch your son regularly?
"I mean, maybe a little bit, but I don't really earn that much money to be able to afford something like day care or, you know, full-time babysitting."
"Yes, I can understand that. Er, what are some of your natural abilities?"
"Well, I mean, I like to cook. I'm actually in the School of Culinary Arts."
"Oh, I bet you're a really good cook then. Er, what would you think of a plan where you made an arrangement with that neighbor where you would make dinner for her and her, um, daughter, in exchange for her watching your son?"
Mm-hmm.
"Er, you know, maybe you could swap a meal for childcare. What do you think of such an idea?"
"Hmm. That's interesting. I-I've never really thought of anything like that, but yes, it could work."
"Okay. Okay, I'm glad you think like that. Er, except for this neighbor, or is there anyone else who could help you?"
"Hmm. No, I know, there just aren't that many people I trust right now with my son."
"Okay, I can respect that. You-you really have to go with your gut and follow your own intuition. Er, what about the baby's father, is he any help?"
"[giggles] No, no, not at all. He, he really hasn't been in the picture since my son was born."
"Okay, well. You know what? We have a really good head start with the neighbor. I think if you would follow that up, you could find some relief and solve some of your childcare problems. Um, how many days a week do you go to school?"
"It's just been three nights, so I have Monday, Wednesday and Friday classes."
"Okay. Er, so what would it be like if you had a plan where both your neighbor and your mother would help you?"
"Um, you know, if my neighbor could take care of my son for even one day, it would help my mother a lot."
"Okay. So what I'm hearing from you is that if you could just reduce the time you need, maybe your mother would be more supportive, more on board?"
"I mean, I think so, yeah."
"Everything is fine. Er, what do you think, what are your next steps in drawing up a plan between your neighbor and your mother?"
"Mom, you know, just, I guess when I talk to my neighbor and see if she's interested in this idea at all, and if she's, I'll tell my mom about it and, you know, hopefully it'll make her feel a little better and maybe a little more reliable."
"Okay. Sounds like you have a good plan to continue there. Well. Um, now you mentioned that your son is two years old. When will he be three years old?"
In a few months he will be almost three years old.
"Okay. In this case, I have another idea for you. Er, what is, er, maybe you could enroll him in Head Start when he turns three years old? Do you know the program?"
"I've heard about it, but I don't know as much."
"Okay. Head Start is a very affordable, very high quality pre-school program. Er, it's really designed for parents and families, just like you, people who have lower incomes and fewer resources, but Head Start prepares your child socially and intellectually for school. Er, and you know by the time he turns three, you'll find that this routine is something he'd better get used to before he starts kindergarten. Er, would you like more information about local Head Start sites?"
"Yes, I mean, it sounds like it would be really good for my son and, you know, it would certainly help me in terms of childcare."
"Okay. Well. Um, well. It sounds like you have a good plan for the future. Um, now I have seen from the notes of the nurse that you are also working to reduce your smoking and drinking. How is this going?"
"[giggles] You know, I-I've been working on it for a couple of weeks now, and honestly, it's been a lot harder than I expected. Um, especially in the evenings trying to break my routine was tough, but, uh, you know, a couple of nights I hit my goal in terms of, you know, the number of cigarettes and the number of drinks I'm going to smoke. So, I mean, I've done okay for a few days, but not so much for others."
"Okay. So what I'm hearing from you is that it was a bigger challenge than you expected, yes, but you're working on it. You're still tied to it. So yes, that's really commendable. I just want to ask you one question: Have you thought about passive smoking and the dangers it poses and how it might affect your son?"
"Yes, yes. I definitely have it, so I never try to smoke around him, and when I smoke at home, I always go out on the balcony to smoke."
"Oh, okay, good. You know, I can tell you that you really care about your son's best interests here. You know, just from our conversation today, I can tell you that you're a really good mother. Um, let's look back at what we've discussed here so far. Now, we have some good options between the Neighborhood and Head Start child care programs. What do you see as your next steps to get this going?"
"Um, well, I guess I'll talk to my neighbor first and see if she likes that idea, and then if she does, I can talk to my mom about it. Hopefully that will help her situation out. And then, uh, I definitely want to deal with the Head Start idea because I think that would be really good."
"Okay, okay. Well. Um, I think you have a good plan. Um, what would you tell us when we get back together in two weeks, just so that we can kind of rethink and see what progress you've made, you know, when you've accomplished something, great, but if you have a bump on the road, I'll tell you what, we'll stick our heads together. We'll come up with a different plan."
Okay.
"Good. Well, I want to thank you again for coming in today, Sarah. It was really nice to meet you."
Thank you. All right.
You are very welcome.
"Hello, Emily."
Hello.
It's been a while.
"Yes, it's been a while."
This is something new.
"Oh, oh, yeah, the - yeah"
"You got a lip piercing, how long ago was that?"
About a month.
Hmm.
Yes.
What prompted you to get a lip piercing?
"Um, I don't know. I just wanted something different. I got bored and, I don't know, it's kind of nice to stand out a little bit, I think."
Hmm.
"Yes, change."
"Yes, and it looks good."
Thank you.
"Um, I guess you know, as your dentist I have a few concerns about lip piercings, oralpiercings. I wonder what you have heard about how an oralpiercing can affect your teeth or gums."
"I mean, I'm sure it might press on my gums or my teeth, but I don't know how much it will affect me. I have pretty good teeth. I don't know."
Mm-hmm.
I don't really know [incomprehensible 00: 01: 04]
"You have beautiful teeth, as I always tell you."
[laughs] Thank you.
-every time you come in.
Yes.
"Um, I mean, I've had some patients with oral piercings, and they can erode part of the gums right, er, right there in front."
Mm-hmm.
"Um, so that's one thing, and the other thing is, erm, I see quite a few broken teeth."
"Oh, yes."
I wonder what you think of this.
"Well, I definitely don't want it messing with my teeth. I know I've got a low gum, as you've been telling me for a while, and I need to floss, which I can't do."
"Yes, flossing."
"Um, which I don't do, but, um, yes, I don't think I really want to break my teeth - yes, I didn't notice."
There is nothing yet.
I think I'm not paying attention.
"Yes, there definitely is -- there are no problems and you have had them, as you said, only for a short time."
Mm-hmm.
"Er, what if - what would make you decide: ""This is something that's not right for me?"""
"I don't know, I think if I started to see that it actually caused a problem, then I could do it."
Mm-hmm.
"But for now - I mean, I just"
Mm-hmm.
- and it looks pretty cool.
I think so.
"Yes, I am kind of - yes."
"Yes, it looks beautiful. So you want to monitor it and -"
Yes.
""
Yes.
-the effect? Okay.
"Yes. I guess if I really start to see a problem - I mean, it might not last forever, but my teeth, I hope -"
Mm-hmm.
-becomes kind of stick [incomprehensible 00: 02: 30]
"Emily, you said it so well."
Yes.
"-The piercing may not last forever, but the teeth really are"
Yes.
"- hopefully forever. So, thank you for talking about it."
Yes.
"-with me, and even before I do the exam, you know I am always on your case about flossing so that we can maybe take [inaudible 00: 02: 46] -"
"So there are many different directions we could take. Um, you mentioned that you want to change your physical activity. You mentioned that you want to change your eating habits and just want to have more self-confidence for the body. Um, what is your theme for the rest of today's session?"
"I think the activity part is the kind of low-hanging fruit I see. Um, I feel it's going to be more difficult for me to change some of my eating habits right on my doorstep, but if I can maybe get into an activity routine, that might be good to make some of the other changes later."
Yes. Okay. Physical activity feels like the simplest change at first glance.
"Yes, I think so."
"So tell me a bit more about your motivation to become more physically active. I know that you have shared energy levels and I know that you have shared, er, that you would like to see a boost in your mood and feel less irritable and stressed."
"Er, last night I liked to fight with the glass of salsa, like when I opened it. So I think that just such stuff would be, er, you know, in addition to the mood and be more productive and energetic and all that stuff. Er, yeah, that would be a definite end goal for me as well. And then really liking it, I think if I'm more active, my body image or body confidence would improve as well."
Yes. So you want to feel stronger so you can open cans and other things and also just have a better self-confidence.
Mm-hmm.
"Great. So on a scale of zero to ten, zero that is not at all willing to make a change in physical activity, and ten, let's do that. I'm excited. I'm ready. Um, where do you fall on that scale?"
"Hmm, I'd say I'm about eight."
"Okay, so you feel pretty motivated."
Mm-hmm.
"Er, why didn't you pick a six?"
"Well, as I said, I just identified myself as a lot of things that I think would be good. Um, if I were more active and definitely wanted to have that improved mood and energy, er, and feel better about myself. Um, yeah, all those things that I think are what really drives me - this review."
"Okay. You notice - there are too many great benefits to being physically active and, erm, today you mentioned energy, mood, strength and body awareness."
Mm-hmm.
Am I missing something else?
I don't think so.
"Okay, those are the big ones for you."
Yes.
"Fantastic. Well, erm, now we can start to see if you are interested in what that might look like."
"Mm-hmm, yes."
- and which activities you could ultimately choose.
"Yes, that would be great."
Okay.
"Well, thank you, Tanya, for meeting with me today and talking about it. So, there is something I want to ask you that we can discuss in our conversation in some way: What is one thing about yourself or something in your life that you want to change, that you may have felt a bit ambivalent about?"
"Um, you know, I have a lot of anxiety, so there's this test that I have to take. It's a big test and I kind of put it off just because I get very anxious. I don't trust myself that I'm going to do any good with it. Um, and that's something that I always have in my head, it's been in my head for many years, and it's like, I just have to do it. Um, but I always stop doing it because of fear, and I just want it, I don't want to feel it that way."
"Yes. This fear is this obstacle for you and it sounds like that, then you are just not confident that you can make it and make it successfully to this test."
Yes.
And so it's easier for you to just not do it.
Exactly. So I just avoid it and put it off.
"Yes. So on a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is not confident at all, 10 is very confident. How confident are you that you feel that you can overcome your fears about taking this exam?"
"Er, maybe like a four or five."
"Okay. So four or five. Like a fight, like a fight, not like a two or three fight."
"I mean, because I set it up after so many years, so I'm still a lot afraid of it, but I think I'm doing it somehow, maybe the first step. And that's why I would rate it as four or five, because I'm taking that first step, but it's still scary for me."
"Yes. Yes, and you also mentioned that you actually have the date that you have to take this exam."
Yes.
And before you have put it off.
"Yes. And I'm already postponing it somehow according to the S-planning. So, erm, now I actually enjoy it, because I-I already like a changed date and everything. So now it's actually coming."
"Okay. Well, you have made this appointment in the past, and fear has taken over the place where you postponed it."
Yes.
And this time it seems to be a bit different: How come you don't want to reschedule this time?
"Um, I think it's going to take that long. I just have to do it and then I can find out if I can't do it, I have to wait three more months to do it. And then I just study for the next three months. And if I do, I can have that weight taken off my shoulders because it all weighs a lot of weight on me and I think about it every day. And I'm just sick of thinking about it."
So that's really encouraging to think about how good you'll feel after it's done and taken.
"Yes. But then I'm worried, you know, this negative talk, this, you know, if you're afraid. So I'm worried about it, if I don't get through it, you know, how people are going to ask me how I did, and if I don't get through it, I have to tell them, I'm embarrassed. Um, that really scares me."
"Yes. You want to avoid it somehow. Yes. Have those other feelings that might arise, and if not."
Correct.
I would like to hear from you: when was the time in the past when you were afraid of something and you actually did it and it ended well?
"Er, I would say, maybe like four or five years ago, um, I had to do a recording for work and I didn't want to do it. I tried to find every way I could get out of that recording. And, um, and then I played my recording and because of the way I sometimes carry myself, how insecure and very anxious, um, I think other people don't always believe in me."
"And so, uh, when I played the recording, it was actually one of the best shots, and like my supervisor and our national advisor, they were very shocked by it because it was just the way I wore myself. So I thought I don't like compliments that make me, uh, anxious again, but it was a nice feeling because I really didn't trust myself, and to know that I did a good job."
Yes.
"Um, it made me feel good."
"So it really built your confidence in that experience and it almost changed not only the way you see yourself, but maybe also the way other people really saw you and you, you liked that feeling."
"Yes, I did."
"Yes. And that must have been really courageous for you to do something that at first glance seems really disheartening, but you were really successful."
Yes.
"Er, how could you relate that to what you're dealing with now?"
"I mean, I think again, like all those fears, the same fears that I had with those tests, and so, um, but if I could pass that test, if I could have the same feeling that I had when I did a good job like her - you know, I mean, I want to have that feeling again."
Mm-hmm
You know.
So that you create opportunities to create those moments where you can have that feeling again
""
And you just mentioned that you are really proud of yourself.
Yes.
"How do you think you can't move to end our conversation? You originally said you were four or five, what would have to happen for you to feel like a seven to be more confident?"
"Well, considering that this test is coming up in a couple of days, erm, I think for me and just like practicing and just seeing how I'm doing and if I'm doing well, then I think my confidence could rise a little bit."
Mm-hmm
And maybe just having that confidence in myself that I can do it instead of just thinking I can't.
So this positive soliloquy could really make a big difference to you?
Yes. Mm-hmm.
"In summary, it sounds as if you are still a bit scared of this test, which you have postponed over the past few years, erm, but this time you seem more confident of simply taking it. And you have even mentioned times in the past when you were afraid and successful and proud of yourself, and you liked how it means you see yourself and how others saw you, and it seems like you are ready to complete this test and remember that you can succeed?"
Yes.
"Okay, thanks, Tanya."
Thank you very much.
Mm-hmm.
"Well, so, erm, we're here today just to talk about, erm, whatever you'd like to talk about."
"Um, how about we talk about, er, the problem I really have is to motivate someone to do something, er, move out of my house."
"Okay, so, uh, there would be, so what you are, what you're trying to do is, uh, well - tell me, I guess, uh, tell me a bit more about it so I understand it a bit more."
"Well, I've offered my house to someone and, er, for a transitional period."
Mm-hmm.
"You know, and it seems like it's hard for me to be confident and say that I think that the, er, transition period has come and that it's time for the transition."
"So that's a really nice thing of you to bring someone into your house like that when they need help. And, erm, but at the moment you think the time has come to get that person, you know, you're ready to let him or her move out and have your place back with you."
"Yes, that's, it's absolutely true that I want, I-I want change, but I'm not, I'm kind of weak in the realm where it's like the ability to actually say the words. You're right, yes. I'd love to be able to do that."
"Mm-hmm. And what would, erm, what would help you get to the point of actually booting them out?"
"Um. [sighs] I don't know, I am-I am, I think I am kind of, um, the person is important to me and, you know, there's a certain amount of comfort in having someone with you, you know, and I'm just, so, I think I'm at war with myself because part of me wants the comfort of a companion and the other part of me is just, you know - I-I can't - I'm not really sure what I want to do, you know."
"Mm-hmm. So you kind of have a double feeling. You want to, erm, you feel that on some level, the time has come for that person to go, and on the other hand, there's a certain amount of security in having him in the house and knowing he's there."
"Yes, you know, it's like the old sock song, which says: Jack, you're not coming back, you're not coming back, you're not coming back, you're not coming back, you're not coming back, you're not coming back. [laughs]"
But you're not quite ready yet if you want to sing this song.
"[laughs] First of all, I think that if I sang the song, he would go out on the street, because I can sing. [laughs]"
"I thought you did a pretty nice job singing right there, it's scary to be completely honest with you and I appreciate it, I appreciate your sense of humor when you do that."
"Well, you know, in life you have to have a sense of humor in me - the way I see it and otherwise, you know, I'd like to be where the news is. [laughs] I mean, it's either -"
What really helps you get through things is to be able to laugh about it.
"Yeah, yeah, I have to laugh, I mean, even comedians say, you know, uh, most of the -- what I've heard about comedians is that they're really not always that happy and use that in a weird way to, you know, deal with life, so, yeah. [laughs] I kind of, maybe I should go into that. [laughs] Like this girl -"
Her new career.
"Yes, like this girl Ruth, who I know she is - she has a serious job, er, and she does it somehow by the way. [laughs]"
"So, uh, what are the uh, uh, what would be the benefits for you if you had him out of the house now?"
"Mm. Let's see. Well, you know, I'm really not sure, I kind of, you know. Um, I'm having a hard time with that. Um."
Tell me a bit more about it.
"Mm, well, I really have to think about that."
A degree of guilt?
"Yeah, yeah. Maybe a little bit of guilt and I, uh, uh, I just, you know, [sighs] I go back and forth a little bit, you know."
Er-huh.
Yes.
"Because you want to do the right thing, because - because you're a good person and that's what's really important to you is that you're helping others."
"Yes, I-I-yes. I mean I-thank. I-I-I appreciate it when you say that I am a good person. The way I feel. Um -"
"But you have done your duty, the duty is done."
"Yeah. Oops, it's just hard - it's just hard, uh, uh, yeah. I - my j- have done my job and I need to start realizing that I need to be a little bit more confident, I think, and a little bit more, uh, I'm sure of myself."
"And what did you do to get them to play Hit The Road, Jack?"
"Well, erm, I've had conversations with him and sometimes it's not been that pleasant, but I'm - I'm just doing, you know - because sometimes I just keep things that way, and then I was - at one point - really very logical about it, and then the other day I kind of didn't become so logical."
Okay.
[laughs]
"So, erm, you told me earlier that you've talked to some other people and he has some options to go to other places."
"Yes. That's the good thing he does, and I mentioned it. I-I-discussed it with him."
Mm-hmm.
"And that gives me a sense of relief - a sense of relief. As I'm not just, you know, saying yes. You know, go and find your own place or, you know, I mean, there are places where he has a safety net, where he can go, and that's something that I think I'm better at and that makes it easier to discuss and give them options that he can - yes, exactly."
"So you might literally have to pack his bags and help them get to those places, um."
Done. (laughs)
Okay. Are you - that's something you've done before.
Yes.
So when are you going to do it?
"I think, uh, I have plans for the future, uh, and some things that are in the air with me up to where I'm going to live. I've had this place for seven years, but I'm not sure, you know. Every day is a new one - a new, uh, winding road that we're taking, you know?"
"Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm."
Um.
And it's kind of scary.
"Oh God, yeah, yeah. But you know, and it's scary to have an extra, huge trunk to take [giggles]."
And he's that extra trunk.
"Yes, yes."
Okay.
"But I-I mean, and it's not that I don't care about him, I do. But, you know, it's just like, we're both - we're all adults here, come on."
"Okay. All right, so it sounds like you've really worked it out until you're out in a couple of days."
"Um, that's the goal."
Okay.
"And I don't know what his plans are, but those are my plans."
"Okay. Well, I have a strange feeling that your plans will prevail. [Laughter]"
"I like your way of thinking, girl. I-I'll tell him. [laughs]."
"Well, thanks for talking and playing with our little things here."
Thank you very much.
"So, uh, I guess the problem is that, uh, you know, my doctor seems to think that my blood pressure is a little high, but I really don't think there's a problem, and you know, I eat really well. Um. And you know, she suggested that, uh, I look after my caffeine, but really, caffeine isn't a problem for me."
"Okay. Um, but we talked a little bit earlier - earlier in our conversation you said that you felt that maybe it was causing some of your anxiety, so it's a little bit, I'm not sure what - um, where are we? Do you feel that you have some anxiety from the coffee, or is it not a problem at all?"
"Well, you know, sometimes it makes me a little nervous and, you know, I have to go to the toilet more often than some of my colleagues, but - and - and - and work, erm, in the hospital they don't really look good when they go to the toilet often. But, you know, it keeps me awake, it keeps me conscious, it makes me able to do my job better, you know. So I really don't see that it's a real problem."
Yes.
"Um, you know, and - I mean, maybe my blood pressure is a little high, but -"
"Yes. So let me see if I had that. So yes, so you have something positive, the consciousness, and then you kind of feel attuned to your game?"
Mm-hmm.
"Um, and then there are a few negatives with, uh, you know, your employees, uh, that they don't do that, you know - then your boss might not want you, you know,"
Correct.
"- on the floor of the hospital, you know, often."
"Yes, it has to stay that way."
"Yes, yes, and then there is the matter of blood pressure. Does that sound right?"
"Yes, yes. Well, you know, and sometimes, as I said, it makes me a little nervous and, um, I don't know. I-I-am-not-as-happy and relaxed as I usually am. But, you know, I-I really like it, and - and as I said, it makes me more aware of what's going on and - and I-I-feel a lot more attentive."
Yes. How about frequency? Do you feel good about how much coffee you drink?
Yes. I drink about four cups a day.
Okay. Okay. And that feels about right to you?
"Yes. I mean, I mean, it's the colleagues who work at night. Oh, they bring a carafe."
Mm-hmm.
"And, er, I can only imagine."
Yes.
-what-like their bodies are.
"Yes, yes. What would happen if you - if you look at it - maybe reduced this habit? Would that get rid of some of the problematic things?"
"To reduce them, as well as - what do you mean by that?"
The number. Only the number.
"Yes, yes, but I mean, how much do we talk?"
"I don't know - tell me. I mean, erm, you drink four a day."
Mm-hmm.
""
"Probably - because I-I have to have this morning cup, I really - you know, I really like waking up and - and this whole ritual."
Yes.
-I just like the flavours.
Yes.
"So I definitely don't want to give it up, but -"
I gotcha. Okay.
Er -
That is important.
Mm-hmm.
Yes.
"And then, you know, a 12-hour shift - I really think the afternoon to keep me going until the evening is a really good idea."
Yes.
I could probably get up in the morning.
I think it's great.
"Yes, yes, yes."
I think so. So you have identified one of the four possibilities that you may be willing to try.
Mm-hmm.
- let go for a while. What do you think - what do you think about it?
I think that sounds good.
Okay.
Yes.
Fine.
I think I could do it.
-- do today?
"I'm good, thank you."
Good. Why don't you tell me what's been going on since I last saw you?
"Um, I guess everything is fine. I think my caseworker mentioned something about the community service I have to do or something. I don't know."
Okay.
I'm not sure.
"So she has talked to you about it a bit, but it sounds as though you are not quite sure the details."
"Yes, I know she said I had to come in for so many hours, but I don't know. I kind of only half listened."
Okay. So why don't you tell me what you remember from your conversation with your case manager? What do you know so far about community service?
"I know that I have to do it until the end of my trial period, unless I forgot how many hours or whether to find it or whether someone else will find it for me or I-I told you that I am confused."
"Okay, gotcha. Well, you know it has to get money."
"Yes, you know you have time until the end of your trial period."
Yes.
-but you are a little blurred in the details.
"Exactly, yes."
"Okay. Um, maybe if it's okay with you, I can tell you a few, er, of the requirements, maybe I'll go into the details a bit more."
"Yes, yes."
Is that okay?
Mm-hmm.
"Okay, great. Um, so with your community service I know you have 25 hours to do, er, so it has to be done by the end of your probation, and your case manager is a really great resource to help you find a place to do it. So I know that in the past some clients did their community service in food stores or shelters, or somewhere in the community that, you know, is not a family member or friend. Um, the urban ecology center is a really great place. You can work outside, work with younger kids."
"Um, yeah, just me, so I have to find the charitable hours myself?"
So this is something you can work on with your case manager.
Okay.
"So, erm, that's something you can definitely ask her or me, but they can come and give you a few options."
Okay.
"- from places where you can work, some phone numbers you can call."
Okay.
"And that's something we'd like to see done on your own, but if you really feel like you're struggling, then those are phone calls that either you and I can make together or you and your case manager can make together."
"Okay, so I would do that, and then you know, can I come in every 24 hours like on a weekend or how does it work?"
"Well, I mean, 24 hours on a weekend sounds like a lot of time to me."
[incomprehensible 00: 02: 20]
I can - I hear you are really eager to get it done -
"Oh, yes."
"Maybe I know that in the past it was helpful for some other customers to sit down and take a calendar and just mark, okay, I'm doing five hours today, I'm doing three hours today, two hours today. Does that sound like something that might be helpful to you?"
"Yes, I think, just to keep track."
Okay.
I think that's a good idea.
"And then, you know, it could be, I definitely think if you're engaged and it's summer break, it's something you can easily do in a week."
Okay.
What other questions do you have about civilian service?
"I think that's it. I was just worried about who would do it for me, but I know that I have to do it myself, I guess, and that 25 hours have to be done. It seems like that's the time I have to do."
Absolutely.
Okay.
"But you know that if you have any further questions, you can always come to me or your case manager and we are there to support you."
"All right, thank you."
You are welcome.
"Right. Hello Ruth, thank you for coming today. How are you?"
"Um, okay. Except I don't even know why I'm doing this anymore. I'm-I'm just so stupid. I'm such an idiot. I didn't know what it was all about. I'm right - I keep doing the same thing, even though I know it can kill me. I just don't have the willpower anymore, ma'am. Yes, [foreign language]."
"Well, Ruth, it sounds as if you are very frustrated at first, and you say that you are just tired. You have lost all your willpower."
Mm-hmm.
They don't want to move on.
"No, it just seems that the only way out is to circumcise myself, and I just get suicidal thoughts and [foreign language], I'm just very, very depressed and what's going on at home."
"So you really, really feel like you've made it this far."
Yes.
"Yes. You are tired. You are stressed. You feel so sad that you hurt yourself physically, so that you can feel something different from what you are feeling right now."
"Yes. Sometimes a pain in the body. It is, er, [incomprehensible 00: 01: 27] to treat the pain in me and - and the pain in me."
So you were in a lot of pain?
"Yes, I am."
"It must be very, very frustrating to feel all this pain and not be able to do anything about it. And it seems like the only thing you can do now is cry."
"Yes, yes, suicide."
"s okay, Ruth. I understand. Pain inside."
[Foreign language]
So your mother doesn't understand you and you don't have a father?
"I want to help her, but I can't help her. It just makes me sad. I feel that if I don't live anymore, she will be fine, and she wouldn't have to worry about me or pay for my things."
"You feel like your hands are tied, you feel like a burden on your mother. She is a single mother, she works a lot. You have all these problems in your life. And it sounds to me like you are just adding more problems to her."
Yes.
"And if you're not alive, that will solve the problem for her, she will do better."
I-think so?
How will she be better off without you?
Because it won't be a burden to her.
And how stressful are you now?
"Because she has to pay for my food and my uniforms, er, to have a roof over her head."
And how can you help her now?
"Um, I'm trying to be a good kid. I've tried to go to school. I may not have the best grades, but I don't fail in any class."
"Okay. Even if you come here today, Ruth, talk to me, open up and tell me that you don't feel like you want to move in and tell me and trust me that you're hurting yourself and all the pain you're feeling, that you're trying to help yourself in one way or another, and that shows that you don't care. And, more than that, it shows that you care about your mother and that in the end it doesn't sound like you want to leave her alone because you're still worried about her - you're still worried about all the burdens that are weighing on you, that you're even thinking about moving away to make her life easier. It shows me that you care so much about her."
That is true.
"-How could it be the right thing to do? To end your life and hurt yourself when it is only you and your mother? And you just said she is a single mother. She has no husband, you have no father. It is only you two. So, how could it be the right choice? But I understand your pain and I know where you are coming from. And I know that the liberation you feel physically is something that helps you right now. Are there other things that we can help you replace this behavior?"
"Um, I don't know. I don't know. It's just, uh, I'm not sure I can."
"You just told me that you have cut back, that you have also thought about hurting yourself, killing yourself, not being here. In the short term, the cut helps you. You feel like a burden on your mother, that stresses you out. That makes you sad. You see how much she struggles, but at the same time we see how much you have tried to help by trying to go to school. We know that your presence is good. You go most of the time, you know, you try to keep up your grades. You have a C-average, even a high school diploma in mathematics, which we know was the lowest grade you had throughout the semester. So all these things show how much effort you have put in, and we see these efforts. So do what you can, and it's normal to feel like you're cutting back, and you're doing what you're doing."
"Thank you, ma'am, I feel better."
"Oh, thank you, Ruth. Thank you for coming today."
Okay.
"So, Tommy, I wanted to talk to you because I was on Facebook the other day and I saw some pictures of me and some of your friends at a party, and you're such a good boy. Like, I don't know what you're drinking. It's going to ruin your life."
"Um, I mean, it was just like a social get-together. It wasn't that I was looking for, er, the drinks were there and I - all my friends were doing it and it was right - it's not something I like to do occasionally, but whenever the opportunity comes up, it's nice to just let go and have a bit of fun sometimes."
"But, Tommy, there are so many consequences of drinking. You know, you're not even 21, you could get arrested, you could have a drunken car crash, you could screw up your homework, you know. You've got such a bright future ahead of you."
"I-I understand where you're coming from, but I-I-I really did. I-I thought I had it under control and I didn't let myself go too far. I-I didn't want to be, um, how can I put it? I want it under control and I wanted to make sure all my friends are okay, so I didn't let myself drink too much."
"There's really nothing that doesn't drink too much. I mean, everything you drink as a minor drinks too much, you know. Think about it, think about all the things that can happen to you."
Yes. I understand exactly what you are saying. And -
How much do you drink?
"I-I don't think I drink that much. I mean, it's mostly for social gatherings. Like it's nothing I do, like alone or whatever. It's just the -"
Is it like every weekend?
"Every other weekend, I would say."
"Tommy, I'm just so worried, you know, can't think of anything better?"
"Um, I think I can. I-I can probably be more productive in my school work, and instead of going to parties so much, and I-I get you from there and -"
"Yes. Are your friends the problem, maybe you should just start hanging out with more kids in the youth group and not with the kids you were partying with?"
"Yeah, I don't think I've really imposed it on myself. I think it's really been forced at their expense, and I've just followed in their footsteps just because it looks like what they're doing is a lot of fun, and I just want to make sure I get every bit of high school experience I can."
"Well, there are a lot of things that seem fun at the moment that we know are not a good choice, right? These are some of the things we talk about all the time, making good decisions for our lives and really doing what is best for you."
Hm. Yes. I-I-see that I might not drink as much to improve my life to some extent. And I-I-think I can make more effort to lower the level of drinking.
I think we really need to stop.
"Yes. I mean, alcohol is just so prevalent in our society and it's just around me wherever I go and parties and stuff. I kind of feel like I should just get used to it or at least understand its, er, effects before I should let it disappear from my life completely. I don't really see it as something that's going to completely destroy my life."
"I think you're wrong. You know, it really worries me. Anyway, erm, I wish you would stop. If all you're going to do is cut back, that's better than nothing. You know, I appreciate you talking to me about it, but I'm going to keep talking to you about it. It's really important."
"Yes. I-I-I-I-right--I don't see the problem at the moment in that and maybe it's because I haven't really had that traumatic experience, but I am -"
Do you want to wait for this to happen? Do you want to wait for a dramatic experience?
"You're right. I-I don't want - I don't want to be too far away before it's too late. Just as I-I can imagine that something might happen where it's on a scale that I can't escape. And I-I don't think I've ever really had any real experience where alcohol has really affected me so much or affected someone close to me so much. So I think it's something that I feel I've got under control of, but in reality maybe I don't have as much control as I think."
"Well, maybe we can work on it together, and I think we should come up with a plan that works for you, so that you can get control here and stop drinking."
Yes. I think that would be a good step forward in a life where you might be sober and just experience the true aspects of life and not the volatility of alcohol.
"Okay, sounds good."
Okay.
"Well, Chris, so I have to talk to you because, as you know, we have a zero tolerance policy on drugs and alcohol at this school, and as athletic director, my job is to check in with our student-athletes and make sure that everyone is following that rule, and I've heard some of the other kids this weekend talk about a party and what I hear about where you've been there and you know, I can't confirm or deny anything, so I'm not at the point where I can tell you the consequences, but I wanted to talk to you about whether you're drinking or not and how you really can't do that as a member of one of our teams."
"Me - I usually study at weekends and my parents don't let me go to parties, but I kind of use that to my advantage to convince my parents to go to that party that my friends pushed me to go to. And when I got there, I'm not used to something like a party environment where everything you see in the movie kind of happens where you have people who just drink from the bottle."
Mm-hmm.
"- or random games with alcohol just to get drunk for no reason. And, because I was there at that moment, I felt pressured to do and adapt to what everyone else was doing. I wouldn't behave like that - I wouldn't be ostracized."
"Yeah, you know, I get it. Like we were all there. Okay. You know, I was in high school, you know, I drank too. I get it. There's not much to do in this city - and kids drink, but promise, we have those rules."
I understand.
"- and when you are in a team, you have to play by the rules."
"Okay. Um, I know it's bad for me. It's bad for my body. It's bad for being on the team, being an athlete. It's hampering my performance. Only, I don't know. I feel like my friends are putting me under pressure. I don't know. I feel like I should like to go with different groups of friends. Maybe. I don't know."
"Yes. Chris, come on. You get peer pressure?"
"I don't know how to be on a sports team, you feel great, you have to like being with the group."
"Yes, but you are one of the leaders."
"Right. And as one of the leaders, my team-mates expect me to do the same - I expect them to lead not only in sport, but also in the social environment. And if that is a social custom, then that is a social custom in our society."
Yes. Perhaps you can then start to lead as a non-drinker.
"I could, but it could also backfire. I feel like I could be ridiculed for putting a stick in my butt, you know."
"You're a star player, who's going to take you on?"
"I mean, it's just one - I'm just one person against the voice of the mob."
"You know, there are rules in this school and in my job, I have to enforce them. You know, like I said, I understand them, you know. I don't know if I'm going to be able to do it."
I understand.
"I-I understand that you want to have fun in your teens. I understand that, but you know, you're a star player, we want to keep you in the team. You know, we have to find a way to get through that."
"Well, I don't devote my time to partying and night. Well, non-partying, but, you know, dealing with alcohol to that extent. And let it be published on the Internet."
What do you mean by that?
"Like on Facebook, all the images you've seen on the internet. Like me - I'll avoid situations where I have to go to a party where I feel pressured to actually drink alcohol, and allow what I do privately to be posted on the internet for others to see, though."
"Yes. I mean, we have to agree on this if you want to be part of the team. Okay?"
Right. I stop.
All right. Promised?
I promise.
All right. Shaking.
Shake.
All right. I will see you later.
See you later.
All right.
"I'm not sure how much you know about why you're here or what to talk about. So, basically, I'm going to meet with all the students in the school, usually once or twice a semester, and we're going to talk about, you know, what's going on in your life. I'm going to ask you a few questions about, you know, your goals and what you like to do for fun and for things like that, and then we're going to talk a little bit about, you know, different behaviors and things like that, and so it's pretty casual, pretty informal, just a kind of chance for me to get to know you if that's OK."
Okay.
Okay. Why not start by telling me a bit about yourself?
"Okay. Um, my name is Laura and I'm 17 and I'm a senior in high school."
Okay. And what do you like to do for fun?
"Um, mostly I just hang out with my friends at weekends and stuff."
"Mm-hmm, and when you and your friends hang out, and what do you do? Do you go to football games, do you go to parties?"
"Er, yes, if it's school, maybe like a game or two, or going to the mall, like shopping or to the movies or something, and at night, maybe like a party or something, if someone throws."
Okay. And what hobbies do you have?
"Um, I like reading and I like going outside, I like to go for walks and I like to go hiking and stuff."
"Oh, cool. What are your plans for the time after high school?"
"Well, I plan to apply to college and maybe, you know, have a good career and stuff like that, hopefully."
What do you think are you going to study?
"Well, I'm-I look at journalism, maybe before the law."
"Oh, neat."
"- which is slightly different, but"
"Yes, that's great, that's a really good goal."
"Yes, thank you."
"It's, er, hard work to get into law school. Do you do well at school? What grades do you get?"
"Yes, I'm fine. I get mostly A's and B's, so I'm pretty good, I'm okay."
Okay. In which classes do you get no A's and B's?
"Um, I think all my grades are A and B, so, yeah."
Okay. And do you know where you are going to apply to college?
"Um, I'm not sure yet, but I'm looking at schools in the area, so maybe, I don't know, maybe I'm leaving my house or something."
"Okay. Cool. And, you know, what made you decide maybe to study law or journalism?"
"Um, well, I'm definitely not a mathematician or a scientist, so I started out looking at careers that I might like."
"Okay. Great. Sounds like you have really good goals and work hard at school, as I said. Um, you said when you go out with your friends, you like to go shopping and stuff and go to parties, so do you drink alcohol?"
"Um, not really. Maybe one or two drinks at a party."
Okay. And how often do you think you're drinking?
"Um, maybe once or twice a month at most."
"Mm-hmm, do you have alcohol once or twice a month?"
Yes.
"Okay, and that's maybe 20 times a year."
Possibly yes.
So that's actually quite a lot of drinking?
"Yes, you can say that."
Okay. What do you think is the best thing you've ever had?
"Um, at most two drinks at a party. I don't drink - I don't like to drink a lot. I don't drink - getting drunk is not something that excites me. So I just have a drink in my hand so that my friends don't bother me if I don't drink. It's just like I'm actually doing something. I don't usually drink at all."
But have you ever been drunk?
"Er, no, not really, maybe tipsy, but not like drunk."
"Okay. Um, so the best thing you've ever drunk is two drinks a day."
Yes.
Okay. Interesting. So do you know all the bad things about alcohol?
"Er, yes, yes."
"Okay. Er, so one of the things you really need to talk about with teenagers is drinking and driving. Er, that's actually a really big problem. And even in our country, kids die every year as a result of a drunken car accident. So that's something you really need to make sure you're not doing it, okay? Have you ever done that? Have you ever gotten in the car?"
"No, I've driven drunk and I've never got into a car with a drunk driver."
"Okay. Er, how much do your friends drink?"
"Um, I mean, I have some friends who drink more than others, like my close group of friends who don't really drink that much because I don't really care, but I know that there are people who drink a lot more."
"Okay. What about those parties you go to, are there other kids there who drink a lot?"
"Yes. There are children who drink a lot more than I do. Definitely, yes."
And hang out with them?
"Not really close, like, I know who they are, and I say hello, but not -- they're not really, like, close friends of mine."
"Mm-hmm, so you know, even if you're just hanging out with kids who drink a lot, you're at much greater risk. Did you know?"
"Er, yes, that makes sense."
"Yes, so, there, I mean, there are a lot of other dangers of drinking, like, um, not just car accidents, but you can have other accidents, you know, people, uh, you know, are going to fall or, uh, you know, things break or a lot of people actually break their bones and end up in the emergency room because they were drunk and fell or, you know, as a girl, it's really important that you be careful because you could be sexually abused."
Yes.
"You know, especially when you've been drinking, you know, you're at a much greater risk because a guy can take advantage of you. did- have you thought about it?"
"Yes, yes, I do. That's, er, one of the main reasons I don't like drinking."
Mm-hmm.
""
"And then, uh, you know, people get into fights more often when they're drinking. Uh, also, you know, there were a lot of kids, even in that school, who got into trouble because they were drinking and someone took photos with their phone and put it on Facebook."
Yes.
"And then their parents or the school, and you know, we have a policy of intolerance to drugs and alcohol here, and that can really get you into trouble, and it could jeopardize your entire college career."
"Yes, absolutely."
But you still drink.
"Um, yeah, I mean, I think that's what you should do at a party, so..."
"Er-huh. So, I mean, do you think this is the right thing to do if you want to become a lawyer?"
"Um, definitely not, so I try not to drink too much."
Mm-hmm.
"- to make it look like I am, somehow."
"Mm-hmm. Okay. Hmm. Well, I mean, what we have to do then is talk a bit about goals, how we should behave."
Okay.
-more secure.
Okay.
"Um, of course you shouldn't drink at all. Er, what do you think?"
"I certainly agree with that, because I know that alcohol carries other risks, such as health risks and those you mentioned, so I agree that alcohol may not be the best."
Mm-hmm. So do you think you can stop?
"Um, yeah, I mean, it's not really a big part of my life, like that."
Okay. So I will write down that you have decided to stop.
Okay.
"And, um, that's going to be your goal, and that's great, you know, that's really the reason we're here is to talk about it and make sure you get to that decision. Um, so I guess can you stop this weekend?"
"Yes, definitely. I'm just not going to have a drink."
"Okay, so what about your friends who are still drinking?"
"Um, I really can't control what they do, but I will definitely try to get my closest friends to maybe stop doing what I want."
"Okay, and what if they don't?"
"Well, then I think I'm just going to try to hang around them less or something. I'm going to try to find things for us that don't involve alcohol, like a party or something."
"Yes. If your friends don't stop drinking, you should just make new friends."
Okay.
"""Because, you know, the problem is, if they drink, they're going to force you to drink and then you're going to feel uncomfortable and, you know, you're going to get stuck and not know what to do and really you're probably going to be better off without them."
Yes.
- they are probably not a good influence.
"Okay, yes."
"Um, and then you're better prepared for college, because, you know, the problem is you get good grades now, but when you get to college, it's much harder and, you know, if you need really good grades to get into law school, which you need, then you really can't be distracted by alcohol."
"Okay, yes, definitely."
"Okay, so, uh, that's great because it covers pretty much everything I think I had to go with you. Um, let's see. I don't think we talked about what would happen if your parents found out you were drinking."
They would be quite upset. Yes. They do not really tolerate alcohol consumption.
Mm-hmm.
""
"Okay, so, yeah, just another reason why you'll probably just have to stop. Um, okay, yeah. Okay, so, as I said, I'm going to look right down here that you've decided to quit and, um, uh, you know, I'm probably going to meet with you again sometime next semester so we can kind of check in and make sure that, you know, it's still going well."
Okay.
"- and you still don't drink and don't hang out with any people who drink. Er, is there anything else you want to talk about during your stay?"
"Um, no, no. I think I'm good."
"Okay. Er, any questions or anything else."
"Er, no."
- how that?
I have no questions.
"Okay. Are you sure? Okay. Everything's fine. Um, that's probably it. You can, er, go back to class and - and thank you for coming in."
"Okay, thanks."
"Hello, Andrea. Thank you for coming in today. So I don't know how much you've been told why you're here, but basically it's my job to just meet with all the students. I usually meet with you once or twice a semester, and I'm going to talk to you about your life and your goals and some behaviors that you might get involved with, and things like that."
Okay.
So why not tell me a bit about yourself first?
"Er, well, my name is Andrea, as you know, I am, er, in the brass band. I play tenor sax."
Oh.
"Yes. I'm into music. So I'm also in the jazz band, in the brass ensemble, and uh, yeah, that's what it's about -"
Okay.
I am an IB student.
Okay. How long ago was it since you started playing the saxophone?
"Well, saxophone. I started about four years ago, but I've been involved in music for about ten years."
Wow. That's a long time. What other instruments?
I started on the violin.
No kidding.
"So I played it for six years, once clarinet, tried different things here and there, and then I found the one thing - the right thing for me."
"This is fantastic, and you play tenor saxophone?"
"Yes, the tenor saxophone."
Wow. And how long have you been in the brass band?
Marching band since the first year. Like three years.
Okay. A few years. Great. And how do you like Marching Band?
"It's fun, it's a lot of work, long summers, but it's fun."
What are your favourite parts of it?
"Oh, I really like the group situation."
"Oh, okay."
"You know, working with my other classmates and stuff, and putting this whole show on."
Er-huh.
"'It's very exciting, very exciting once you're in competition."
Okay.
It's very cool.
Cool. And do you have many friends who are with you or
Yes.
"friends outside the band, right?"
"I have, um, you know, I have two or two separate groups: I have my friends from the class and then my friends from the band."
Okay.
So.
"Great. And then, erm, tell me a bit about your family?"
"Oh yes, I have a brother who is older than me, about nine years older than me."
"Oh, wow."
"And, er, my parents and my dog. (laughs)"
Okay. What kind of dog do you have?
He's a golden retriever.
"Oh, fine."
Charlie.
Charlie.
He's a big boy.
"Oh, sweet. Have you had it for a long time?"
"Yes, he's about eight years old now."
Oh gosh. Yes. Okay. Very cool. And what are your plans for the time after high school?
"Er, yes, I do plan to go to school and one day I would like to be a doctor."
Wow.
"I'm interested in psychology, psychiatry, that sort of thing."
They have big dreams.
Yes.
Cool. Good. Have you started thinking about schools or majors? I think you're thinking about psychology as a major.
"Yes, psychology, I didn't really think about what school I meant."
Correct.
"Everyone wants to shoot for the Ivy Leagues, so [giggles]"
And what about the notes?
"Er, they're pretty good, you know, high three-point things."
Okay. Good. Very good. Okay. What are those things you do for fun at the weekend?
"Er, I usually go out with my friends. Er, we go to the cinema or we probably just meet up at someone's house."
Mm-hmm.
-and just hang out and things.
Mm-hmm. Is there any alcohol at all when you're hanging out?
Sometimes [giggles] I'll be honest.
"Er-huh, how often do you think you drink alcohol?"
"Um, depending on how much school work there is, if there isn't, it could be like every other weekend or like three weekends a month or something."
"Oh, so you drink a lot?"
"A bit, yes."
Okay. And how much do you drink on the days you drink?
"Um, I don't, we don't get drunk or anything like that. It's more like a little tipsy thing."
Mm-hmm.
I got drunk before.
Mm-hmm.
"- but somehow I did, learned my lesson, didn't like it."
So you - you drank quite a lot. What - what do you think - is the best thing you've ever had?
How many drinks?
Yes.
"Um, it was a good amount. It was the first time I drank, and it was like three or four cups, but it was a mixture of different things."
"Okay, so you don't even know."
So I'm not - yes.
"Okay. So, and then your friends are drinking too?"
"Yes. Not all, but some."
Okay. And how much do they usually drink?
"More or less the same amount. The best we have now is maybe one cup after another, but sometimes one or two, but they can be quite heavy."
"Okay, so it's a cup, but it's not a drink."
"Oh, it's a red, you know, typical."
It contains a lot of alcohol.
Mm-hmm.
"Okay. Um, so gosh, you actually drink quite a lot. Um, you know, your alcohol level puts you in what we call a high-risk group."
Mm-hmm.
So does this surprise you?
A bit.
"Yes. Um, that's what we call high risk, because it means that it's actually quite likely that you're going to have some bad consequences if you drink like that. So, you know, things like, erm, have car accidents or other accidents, or get involved in fights, or, you know, have sexual assault or health problems or develop alcoholism. Have you thought about those things?"
"To be honest, not too much. I - I always thought, since it is, you know, within my small group of friends -"
Er-huh.
"- and we usually sleep over each other's house, we don't get into the problems of drinking and driving, and possibly sexual assault and the like."
Er-huh.
But I didn't really think about possible alcoholism or anything.
"Okay. That's how it is, er, that's how it is, because you don't drink and you don't drive, but you still drink a lot. Um, and yes. Okay. So let's talk a little bit about how you might be able to make some changes, because I think you really need to stop drinking like that."
Okay.
"Er, do you think you could stop drinking, right?"
"Yes, I think I could. I don't need it. For example, it is - it is - as a way of getting the party going."
Er-huh.
But we didn't always have that.
Er-huh.
So I think it would be possible to stop drinking.
Okay. So does that mean you're going to stop drinking?
"Um, I'd probably start liking it because my friends are involved too, so I'd say, ""Hey guys, I don't think I'm going to drink today."""
Er-huh.
And let's see how it goes. Because -
"Okay. Er, you don't sound like you think it's going to work."
"Yes. It's, you know, it's one thing to control my own drinking, and it's another thing when everyone else around me is drinking, and then there's such a pressure."
Mm-hmm.
"'Oh, they'll think I look stupid. '"
Okay. So how do you want to stop drinking without your friends thinking you look stupid?
Yes.
"Okay. Um, so I mean, do you think they're really good friends of yours when they're giving you such a hard time?"
"Those close to me, I know they wouldn't have a problem with that, you know, but the ones I'm not so close to, I'll still be happy to hang out with them."
Er-huh.
-these are probably the ones who want to exclude me for something or.
It sounds as though you might be better off without them.
Yes.
- perhaps not very good friends.
Probably too judgmental.
"Mm-hmm. So, erm, so I think we should set a goal for you to stop drinking."
Okay.
"And, er, I think you should probably stop as soon as possible, as you did this weekend."
Okay.
"Um, the way it normally works, you know, we set a goal for you, and then I'll let you come back and we'll talk about it again in a couple of weeks and make sure you've actually stopped. Um, and what do you think about it?"
"Um, I think - I think the possibility."
Okay.
"I think that if you have a good plan, as I believe, I could implement it."
"Okay, great. So, the plan is that you quit and, erm, the friends you have that you think they don't support you, you just won't hang out with them anymore."
Yes. I think I can.
"Okay. And then, uh, you know how, your friends in the band drink?"
"Um, not really. Those who drink more are the ones like my classmates. My band friends, we focus on band music."
Er-huh.
- so I can't really -
"Okay. So that could be good, it's really just to focus more on the band. Um, because you know, the other big concern I have for you is, if you want to go to medical school, you're never going to medical school if you drink like that."
Yes.
"You know how hard college is going to be, and especially with all the pre-treated classes, you're not going to be able to drink that much. You know, have you thought about it?"
"Honestly, not too much."
"Yes. Okay. So it will be really helpful to set this goal, to stop drinking. And, erm, it sounds like i-it shouldn't be that hard, um, especially because you can just stop hanging out with drinking."
Mm-hmm.
"-the people who drink a lot, erm, because you have a few other friends. Um, yes. So do you have any questions for me?"
"Um, what am I supposed to do, er, yes. So, how am I supposed to say, let's say, I'm hanging out with my friends and they say, ""Hey, why don't you drink - why don't you drink?"""
Mm-hmm.
How should I proceed in this situation?
"A good option would be to talk to them about all the bad things about alcohol. You can say, you know, ""I thought about it and I realized that it was going to mess up my homework, and you know, it's really a big risk to my health."" ""I don't want to become an alcoholic."" Um, you know, ""I don't want to get liver disease."" ""I don't want to drive drunk or get involved in accidents."""
Mm-hmm.
"One thing to address is, ""I've heard a lot of stories about kids you know who are at parties and behaving drunk and stupid, and then people post stuff on Instagram."""
""
"And you know, that's it for her social life, it's like it's over."
Yes.
""
"And you know, as does working life."
Mm-hmm.
"I don't want it to bite me on the bum, [giggles] in the back."
"Yes. So I think, just tell your friends, you realized that there are always bad things and you don't want to do it anymore, so you just won't do it."
Okay.
""
I think I can.
"- You can also tell them to stop. You know, that would be really good. You would be a good friend."
"You know, as a group, we all work together to get better."
Yes. Yes. Exactly. All right. Any other questions or anything I can help with?
"No, I think I'm good."
"Okay. So, as I said, I plan to meet with you again in a few weeks."
Okay.
And make sure you actually stop drinking.
Okay.
All right.
Sounds good.
Great.
"So I know that we found out that you sprained your ankle yesterday, and I wonder if you can tell me anything about how that happened?"
"Er, it's really stupid. Er, I was on a pub trip last night and you know what pub trips are like. You have a few drinks and then I thought it was a really good idea to catch up with my friends who are in front of me, yes, they are in front of me. So I just jumped off the stairs of the bus and wore them like stilettos because they were 90s style pub trips. No matter, and then I just fell on my ankle. It was really embarrassing."
Sounds like a wild night.
Yes.
Yes.
"It was a lot of fun, but I didn't dance after that."
"No, I guess that would be the end of your, er, shaking and moving. I know - I wonder if you would be willing to investigate your alcohol consumption and what it looks like during the week."
"Er, sure, er, as long as we don't talk too much about vodka, I'm still, er, a bit -"
They are still feeling the effects of climate change.
Yes.
"* * * Last night, right?"
A bit.
"Oh wow, it was"
Yes.
- really a rough night.
"Well, that's normal."
So what is a typical week for you in terms of your alcohol intake?
"Um, well, me and my friends, uh, we party at weekends and, you know, we're all university students, so it's just normal, uh, to have a few drinks."
So a few drinks are nothing new to you?
No.
And what do a few drinks look like? Is it a night? Is it two drinks?
"Er, per night, er, like when we go out, oh, that's a lot. It's like I could probably drink seven or eight drinks, like when I go hard. Er, and then, you know, like maybe when I get home from school, a long day at the library, have a beer or two, like that."
Good. Do you have any concerns about your alcohol consumption at all?
No. I don't know. It's normal for university students that I feel.
"Okay, so you're not too worried at this point and you think the other students are doing just that?"
Yes.
Would you be willing to look at the guidelines for low-risk drinking?
"Yes, for sure."
"I do not know how you are feeling at the moment, but I wonder if we can have a quick look at it."
Yes.
"- and what are the safe limits for women are 10 drinks for women a week with about two drinks, er, a day."
Oh really?
Yes.
Wow.
Where do you feel drawn into this?
"Er, er, I'd say something about that."
"Okay, okay."
Especially when the midterm elections are coming up.
"Okay, so is it a way to deal with stress?"
Yes.
"Right, and is that something that, you know, was a way to deal with it for a while?"
"Yes. Yes, I guess."
Okay. Does that worry you at all?
"Er, I mean, the 10 drinks don't seem like much, er, for like-minded people and like my tolerance."
Mm-hmm.
I guess I've kind of built it up over the years.
Okay.
"Um, so that's a bit - a bit, er, as far as I'm concerned."
Do you feel you have any reasons to keep your alcohol intake within limits?
"Er, any reason for that? Er, I guess health reasons."
Tell me more about it.
"Um, well, I mean, I'm definitely not feeling good right now. Um, and that's it - I definitely feel more productive when I don't have a hangover. Er, so I see an advantage."
So you can see some advantages in reducing the amount of drinking.
Yes.
"-Um, what do you consume during the week?"
""
"Would you be willing to explore this with me at some other time, when you might feel a bit better? Would you be willing to come back and talk to me about it?"
"Yes, yes, I think if I'm feeling a little bit better - maybe if I haven't been through the whole night before and sprained my ankle."
"I would be happy, er, to make an appointment for you if you can come at the end of this week or the beginning of next week."
"Okay, okay."
way of exploring this a little further and perhaps some of these benefits of reducing it to safe limits. Could we do that?
"Sure. Yes, just not on a Saturday morning. [giggles]"
That's okay for me.
Okay.
Thank you very much.
Yes. Sounds good.
"So let me tell you what I usually do in this, er, this interview, and we - we talk for maybe 20 minutes or so. Usually, I just give feedback from all the questionnaires you answered last week."
Mm-hmm.
"- and then we just talk about it together. So, erm, but I always like to start where you want to start."
"Um, yeah, I, [sigh] that, I mean, when I did those questionnaires, it was weird, because I mean, I don't really think about how, you know, the drinking being, like, this huge thing, and I don't know how."
Mm-hmm.
- Never really think about how much I drink.
Mm-hmm.
"Um, and, like, like, like, like, like, how much I drink every day, it was like, wow, you know."
Hm.
"- like, I just never really thought about how that was me - like, when I try to really count the drinks, it's, somehow, a lot, I mean, it's, somehow, a lot."
You were quite shocked by what you learned about your patterns.
"Well, ""because I kind of thought I was drinking about as much as my friends, and then I went back and talked about it, like, with my roommate, and I told her, like, you know, I was drinking, like, like, 10 drinks a weekend, like, including Thursday, like, Thursday, Friday."
Hm.
"Saturday, Sunday."
Mm-hmm.
"And then she was like, ""Sarah, that's crawling - like, that's crazy. Why are you, you know, like, where do you drink that?"" And I was like, ""Well, you know, like, different places."" And I - I guess, like, I don't know, my friends didn't know how. Anyway, it's, yeah, I don't know."
"Yes, this information has opened your eyes in a way, and when you spoke to your roommate about it, she was even shocked to know that you drank as much as you did - as you realised when you completed the questionnaire."
"Yes, and yes, I think it was just like that, I thought everyone was going to do it, you know."
Mm-hmm.
- but that wasn't really what was going on. [giggles]
"Yes, the fact that your drinking differs from others is clearly something you never really considered before?"
Yes.
Mm-hmm.
So that was the strangest thing about it that I did.
Okay.
forms.
Hi Laura.
Hello.
"Thank you for coming. Um, so I'm not sure how much you already know about what you're doing here. If it's okay, I'll give you a little overview."
Yes.
"So, basically, we're here, I'm just going to talk to you a little bit about what your goals are for your life, er, getting to know you a little bit better and talking about a few different behaviors that you might be going to engage in. It's not at all my job to judge you or try to change you, you know. Basically, I'm going to talk to you about how things are going, about all the changes you want to make in your life, how I could help you with that, and exactly what I can do will benefit you the most."
Okay.
Does that sound right?
Yes.
"All right, so I guess to get started, can you tell me a bit about yourself?"
"Well, my name is Laura. I am 17 years old and I am a senior in high school."
Okay. And what kind of things do you plan for your life?
"Well, hopefully you go to college, you get, you know, good grades to go to college."
Hm.
Yes.
That's great.
Yes.
Do you have a plan for where you want to go or not?
"Um, I'm not sure yet. Maybe a few schools in the area, I might look to apply outside the state."
Oh.
So you might move away to attend college.
Cool.
Yes.
"So, kind of keep your options open."
"Yes, absolutely."
Great. And do you have an idea what you might want to study or not?
"Yes, maybe before the law."
"Oh, wow. Okay, that's exciting."
Yes.
"Good, cool. Er, what do you like to do for fun?"
"Well, erm, at weekends I like to hang out with my friends, maybe go to a party or go to the mall to shop, or if there's a school-related event, we go to a football game or a football game."
Mm-hmm.
"- something like that, yes."
Want to have a good time?
Yes.
"And you have a lot of friends or a few close people, don't you?"
"Um, I'd say like a moderate amount. I'm not really popular or like it, I don't have any friends."
Mm-hmm.
So I'm like normal.
All right.
Yes.
"That's a good way to be, isn't it?"
Yes. [giggles]
"Well, so, erm, it generally sounds like you're doing well, what are your grades at the moment?"
"Um, they're pretty good, As and Bs. So, I'm fine."
Okay.
Through college.
"Great. One thing I would like to ask is, do you know that different people have different values or things that are important to them. They could, you know, really be close to the family or have, you know, their friends as something very important. So I'm just going to show you a few things on this sheet, and if you can look at them all. So, there are things like belonging, community, cultural identity, family, friendship, modesty, religion, respect, self-determination, and spirituality. Which one of those things is important to you in any way?"
"Um, family definitely, er, friendship and belonging."
Okay.
Yes.
What is important to you about your family?
"Well, I love them, so I want them to think good of me."
Hm.
- and I want them to accept and love me.
Okay. Do you have brothers or sisters?
"Yes, I have a sister."
"Okay, great. And how about friendship?"
"Friendship, erm, I have come close to many people who are dear to my heart, so I would like them to accept me."
Great. So to be a good friend and -
Yes.
"- It is important to have good friends as well, and what about the affiliation? You mentioned that too."
"Yes, simply as if you were inserting yourself and not inserting - and as if you were being accepted -"
Hm.
"- Generally, yes."
Yes. The desire to be part of a group -
Yes.
"- and somehow. Okay, great. Well, well, one of the things I want to talk about is, you know, erm, you mentioned that you'd like to go out and party with friends, and stuff like that. And, I'm curious, if you're at the parties, have you ever drunk alcohol?"
"Er, not much, maybe a drink or two at most."
Okay. Can you tell me something about how alcohol fits into your general social scene?
"Er, I'm drinking pretty much just to have it, so it looks like I'm drinking when I'm not."
Hm.
So maybe people don't bother me when I drink or something.
"Okay, you get pressure from other people who drink, and it feels easier for you."
"Yes, right."
-somehow hold a drink.
- have one there and pretend to have it.
Okay.
Yes.
And do you think this is most weekends or occasionally?
Um.
- often think that you are close to alcohol.
Maybe one or two weekends a month at most?
Okay.
Not really much.
So you're in a situation where alcohol is involved on one or two weekends a month?
Yes.
Okay. And what kind of situation are you in?
"Well, I guess, at a party or something, in someone's house."
Er-huh.
"Or, even if it's not a party, like a small get-together, maybe there are a few beers around."
Hm.
- or something like that.
So basically just kind of hang out with friends.
"Quite a lot, yes."
"Are you ever, um, places where parents are nearby or"
Um -
- or mostly only with the children?
"Mostly just with us, but sometimes I also go to a close friend and close family, so we all just hang out."
Mm-hmm. And what about driving?
"Er, how drunk at the wheel?"
Yes. Do you ever go anywhere by car after drinking any alcohol?
"Um, definitely not. I've never driven drunk, and I've never been in a car with a drunk driver."
"Okay. So, that's something you kind of made a decision about. It sounds like you -"
"Yes, because I know it is extremely dangerous."
Okay. What do you know about how dangerous this is?
"Um, well, alcohol definitely impairs your judgment. So, I mean, driving under the influence of alcohol can lead to crashes and accidents and things like that, so I'd rather not be in that situation."
So really try to be safe - and make sure that
Yes.
-They do not ask themselves -
"Yes, absolutely."
"s great. You know, sometimes it is difficult, and I really commend you for being able to stay with it."
Thank you very much.
"So, you mentioned it, you're going to like to have a drink or maybe a drink or two. What do you think is the most alcohol you've ever drunk in a day?"
No more than two drinks.
"Okay. So, the most important thing."
Yes.
- were there two? Okay. And what do you like about alcohol?
"Um, I've never been really drunk."
Er-huh.
"- so I can't really say whether I like that feeling or not, but it's just like that - I mean, you're just in a good mood."
Mm-hmm.
So.
"So you kind of feel relaxed, don't you?"
"Yes, yes, relaxed."
"Okay. Er, anything else?"
"Um, no, not really. As I said, I don't drink that much."
Mm-hmm.
So I couldn't tell you.
Okay. And any less good things about alcohol?
"Um, definitely, yes. I mean, when I'm at parties and stuff and it gets a little later, there are people who drink - like, have drunk too much, vomit, or get hurt, or they're really loud and disgusting, and that's not fun for anybody."
Mm-hmm. So you have seen many other children who
Yes.
-had some consequences -
Yes.
- and decided that this is not for you?
Yes.
"I-I can understand that. [giggles] Er, any other things you can imagine?"
"Er, no, I mean, I've never been friends with someone who's been in a serious accident and stuff."
Mm-hmm.
"- very, very repugnant things."
"Okay. Well, you know, as someone who is not yet 21, it is - underage drinking something that is not legal."
Yes.
"- and this is something that is considered quite risky, so I wonder what you think of it, just in terms of how it fits into your life."
"Um, I know it's definitely risky, but I mean, I guess we're still doing it. [giggles]"
"Uh-huh. So, it's kind of what you are -"
It's just there.
"It's just there? Okay. And, I'm curious, you mentioned, you know, your friends are important to you, and your family is important to you, and some kind of affiliation is important to you. How does alcohol play a role in that?"
"Um, well, definitely not in my family life, because my parents don't really tolerate that."
Okay.
"-alcohol consumption, but friendships, I mean when I hang out with my friends, or we're at a party or something, alcohol is usually involved."
"Okay. So from a family point of view, drinking doesn't go very well?"
Yes.
"And with friends you feel like it's easier to hang out with alcohol, or maybe you're not having so much fun, or your friends don't like you that much, do they?"
"I guess I mean, because it's just there."
Okay.
""
Understood.
-it ties in with the whole related thing.
"Okay. Well, if you think about your drinking and look ahead in 5 or 10 years, how do you think drinking might fit into your life?"
"Er, she'll probably play a very small role, if any."
Mm-hmm.
"- in my life, considering that I have big plans for my future."
Okay. Can you elaborate a bit more? What do you mean by that?
"I mean, I don't think I'd drink that much or go to parties that much if I was studying for school or college or trying to study law and stuff."
"Okay, so alcohol is something that might make it harder to achieve your goals?"
"Yes, absolutely."
"Um, so if you look ahead, how often do you think you might drink when you get to college?"
"Um, maybe less than I am now. I mean, I don't drink much anyway, so I don't"
Mm-hmm.
-Maybe you drink a blue moon from time to time.
"Okay, so you sort of have a plan to cut spending."
"Yes, absolutely."
-Your alcohol consumption at some point?
Sure.
How could this be?
"Well, I mean, I think now I would try to quit high school, and when I get older, maybe socially, but nothing big or anything else."
"Yes, you do not feel the need to make major changes, but you do feel that you could make some adjustments to make it easier or -"
"Definitely, yes, that's a good word."
"Okay. How important is it for you to make some adjustments to your drinking, on a scale of 1 to 10? Where 1 is not important at all, not something you think about, and 10 is the most important."
Maybe five or six.
And why did you say five or six and not two or three?
"Because, erm, it's not something I don't care about, but it's not something I want to change about myself all the time."
"Okay. Well, it's something you've thought about or something."
"Yes, yes. Definitely."
Okay. And how confident are you that you would be able to make a difference if you decided to do it on the same scale?
"Um, I'm pretty sure I'm not an alcoholic per se."
Mm-hmm.
"I don't really like this whole scene, so it's not difficult for me."
So what number would you say?
"Er, on a scale from 1 to 10-"
Mm-hmm.
- whether I can quit or not?
Yes.
Maybe like an 8 or 9.
"Okay, and why would you say 8 or 9 and not even 5 or 6?"
"Because, as I said, it's not a big part of my life, so it's not really that difficult."
"Okay. Well. Well, when you look at it, it sounds like you have some sort of vague plan on how to adjust your drinking behavior at some point."
Yes.
This is something you would like to do because you have these big goals for yourself and because you are actually very confident that you will succeed with them. What kind of goal should you set yourself today?
"Um, probably to stop, maybe the next party I go to and not have a drink at all."
"Okay. Er, do you feel pretty sure you can just quit?"
"Yes. I mean, I can only tell my friends -- my pa--My friends aren't really that pressured."
Er-huh.
"It's like people from outside, who I don't really know very well."
Okay.
"So I could just say to them, ""Hey, I don't fancy a drink today."""
What could be some advantages to achieve this goal?
"Um, definitely, I'll have all my senses there and be aware of everything that's going on."
Er-huh. Anything else?
"Um, health concerns, I think. I know that alcohol is bad for health."
Mm-hmm.
So that's it.
Okay. So it sounds like you're actually quite comfortable setting yourself a goal of not drinking - at least not in the next part - and seeing how it goes.
Yes.
Okay. Do you think it would be okay if we met again to kind of check in on how it works and see if it works for you?
"Yes, that would be fine."
"Good, great. And then, i-it sounds like some of the benefits you're expecting are, um, health benefits."
Yes.
- It is easier for you to achieve your academic and professional goals and you simply do not have to deal with some of the consequences that your colleagues have.
Correct.
"Okay. Well, very good. Er, is there anything else you think it would be important for me to know?"
"Er, how would you advise me to maybe get my friends to stop drinking?"
"Oh, that's a great question. So it's often more difficult for kids who are trying to save up when their friends are still drinking, and one of the easiest things is to have more activities that are not alcohol related."
"Okay, yes."
"- Of course, it's more difficult if you're not the one who plans. So, some of the things that can be useful when you're at a party, say, um, and there's alcohol already, and there are other kids who maybe aren't his closest friends, um, some of the things that I would recommend, because you're interested in that, are, you know, carrying around another drink that looks like it has alcohol in it."
Oh yes.
"Um, often everything in your hand is a good barrier to people trying to offer you alcohol because you already have something in your hand."
"Yes, that's a good idea."
- and it somehow prevents them from trying to stuff something else in there. Do you think one of those things might work for you?
"Yes, for sure."
"Okay. How about talking to your friends about it, have you thought about how to deal with them, or is this something else you'd like to have some tips on how to share your plan with them?"
I mean -
-to stop drinking.
"'I just wanted to tell them I don't really want to drink anymore, it wasn't me."
Er-huh.
So.
Your friends would be quite comfortable with that?
"Yes. I mean, at least my closest friends, for sure."
"Okay, great. Any other concerns or questions? What else can I help?"
"No, I think I'm okay."
"Okay. So, like I said, erm, I'll try to see if we can maybe meet in a couple of weeks and see how it goes."
Okay.
"- and then, erm, if things go well, then fantastic, and if you encounter any stumbling blocks, then maybe we can solve problems together."
"Okay, great. Thank you."
That sounds OK?
Yes.
All right. Thank you very much.
No problem.
"Thank you for coming in today, Katie. I'm looking forward to getting to know you, and maybe I'll just start by telling you a little bit about you and what brought you in today."
"Er, yes, for sure. Er, I guess, well, my doctor has referred me to see you. Er, I guess he has some concerns about, er, me - my pregnancy and my baby. So, er, yes, well, I'm doing what I'm told."
"So you are continuing your meeting with me today and you mentioned that he has some concerns, can you tell me something about that?"
"Er, yes, he's worried about my alcohol consumption."
"Okay, and I wonder if you have any concerns about that."
"Er, no."
"No. Okay. So that's not a problem for you. Er, it's a problem for him and not for you at this point."
Mm-hmm.
Okay. So how about you maybe report a bit about your alcohol consumption and maybe a bit about how your life looks to me today?
"Er, okay. Er, I think I drink like a glass of wine every night for dinner, and just to relax a little bit with my friends when I go out. So wine has always been a kind of family tradition with dinner."
Okay.
Yes.
"So it was a bit of a part of your culture, and you know, just find alcohol, maybe lose a bit and -"
"Yes, and I, you know, I-I have friends who have been drinking during pregnancy, and-and I see articles on Facebook and-and-and, you know, things that show that there's no clear connection between, you know, abnormalities or, uh, yeah, I'm right - I just think it's kind of an old marriage story. So, you know, I'm independent and gonna- I'm going to do what I want, it's my body."
"Okay. So you're not very comfortable with someone telling you what to consume, what kind of alcohol you should consume, and how much alcohol you should consume. And, erm, it sounds like you've received mixed messages, your doctor says there's no safe amount of alcohol you can drink, and asks you to come to me. And then you've also checked - sounds like you've checked things out a bit."
"Yes. You know, I looked up to see, you know, kind of what I can say back, you know, to support my argument."
Okay.
"Yes, that's that, uh, I'm going to do what I want to do and what I know, right? So it's - yes. I don't know, but, uh, I'm here anyway."
"So you know each other best and you want to be kind of the boss of your body, and you don't want someone else to tell you what's OK and what's not."
"No, I never was."
"Okay. And I wonder if this concern comes from ""It was okay. I got these messages from friends."""
Yes.
"""Um, the media said it's OK to drink while drinking alcohol, and with that, um, somehow, I don't have that worry, and maybe the doctor's wrong."""
Mm-hmm. I think so.
You're not sure if he's playing things out there a little bit?
"Yes. I mean, you know."
It could be a bit extreme.
Yes.
"- to stop drinking. Er, I just wonder, are you, er, perhaps open to just taking a look at what Canada's guidelines on drinking say? Er, is that something you'd be open to?"
How now?
Yes.
Uh-
"What if- er, can I show you a brochure on this?"
"Er, yes, I guess."
Yes?
Sure.
"Well, if we take a look at the low-risk alcohol guidelines, then what it says is, for women, er, the safe limits are 10 drinks a week for women and 2 drinks a day. And that's if a woman is not pregnant, and if the guidelines say, as far as drinking is concerned, er, there is no safe amount to drink during pregnancy. So really zero alcohol is, er, the woman shouldn't drink at all, and I just wonder what you think about that."
"Well, you know, I've heard that sort of thing before, but I just do it - I don't see the evidence. I don't see the risk, you know, I don't know, you know, if someone can prove something to me or show me a direct connection or something like that."
"So if you see it here in a kind of black and white, you're not sure if that, er, is enough."
It's the same thing.
- Convincing you that it could be dangerous to drink through alcohol?
"Yes. It's just a nice little brochure that says what I already knew, what I've heard."
"So you get the feeling, uh, what the doctor says and this pamphlet just kind of feels like, yeah, it blows things a little bit out of proportion."
Mm-hmm.
And it sounds as if you already have some solid information that alcohol was safe to have during pregnancy. Tell me about this information you have researched.
"Um, well, I looked up, er, various articles. Um, and I - as I said, I personally know people who had no problems. Um, so it's about the extent."
"Mm-hmm. You mentioned that you looked up some articles and it sounds like evidence is really important to you. So, erm, these articles, is that something new? Um, you can tell me about it."
"Like, erm, I don't like it - like a bibliography or something."
Mm-hmm.
So I can't really say - I don't really know when they were released. It's just things I've found that support the way I look at them.
"So you felt, er, the information you found supports the values you have, which is to be independent and autonomous, to be able to make your own choices and the information your doctor has given you or talked to you about it, and then this kind of brochure feels like a challenge to your values."
"Yes. Well, it's as if this pamphlet just says that, um, the same thing again, the same thing I heard, that the limits and that there is no safe amount of drinking during pregnancy, but it's like, why not?"
Mm-hmm.
"You know, it's kind of like ""why"" that you like it."
Mm-hmm.
-I never get this information.
Wha-what's the big deal when you drink and -
"Yes, what kind of problems would this cause, if any?"
"Maybe we can put that on the shelf for a moment, and we'll come back to that and kind of look at what that is - what the guidelines have to say about it. And, um, and - and I wonder if we can take a quick look at, um, your pregnancy, and is that something you were - you were hoping to have a baby?"
Yes.
That was something you had planned?
Yes.
"Okay. And I wonder so far, er, to give birth to the baby and, you know, your future as a parent, ho-how important is it for you to have a healthy baby?"
"Um, well, it's really important to me. A big priority of mine is to have a healthy baby and raise it well - and, you know, to be a good parent."
Mm. What does it look like to be a good parent? Tell me more about it.
"Er, not being at home like they are, not being away, er, looking after them, feeding them, er, changing their nappies, which doesn't bother me. Er, you know, sort of like those basics."
Hmm. Something like protecting your baby and
Yes.
-to guide your baby and
Mm-hmm.
"-You know, the care of this baby is really important to you -"
Yes.
- and raise your baby well?
"Yes, of course."
"This is something that is really important to you and, er, I hear you say that you care about protecting your baby and at the same time, er, some kind of conflict with some of the information that is contained in the brochure."
Mm-hmm.
What do you think - what do you think?
"Um, I just don't know - I just don't know where these pamphlets get their information or anything like where the hard evidence essentially comes from."
You want to see it in black and white.
Yes.
"You want to know that it's the latest and greatest. Um, that's information I've shared with you before, that's the latest, evidence-based information on the latest research since 2011 and, um, a lot of research has been done on what's right for a mom to consume alcohol. There's the evidence we have, um, but in the end you decide what's best for you and what's best for your baby. What are you - what do you think about it?"
"Um, well, it surprises me that it's based on research from 2011, um, and I must have missed that. I guess if that's the case, er, you know, I want to do the best for my baby and for myself, and if I have to stop drinking, er, I have to do that in the end - I make that decision, um, but, um, that's a lot of information I can take in today."
"Mm-hmm, somehow it feels like you've made some really good decisions about your baby. You've done some research and you want to be able to raise your baby well and take care of your baby. And I-I can see that that's really important to you. I hear you say that and it kind of feels like this information is not what you expected to hear."
Nope.
How would you feel about the next steps if you thought about giving up alcohol for the rest of your pregnancy?
"Um, well, first of all, if I could maybe take a brochure home with me, er, you know, show it to my partner and - and - get their support, er, I think that will really help me and somehow change our habits, or, you know, throw away the alcohol, out of sight. Um, I think that's probably the best thing I can do, like today when I get home."
"Mm-hmm, those are some really significant steps that you're talking about. You're talking about throwing away the alcohol, that's huge, those are really big steps."
Yes.
"I really want to thank you for exploring this with me today, and I wonder if we can somehow continue this conversation and talk about these steps, and how it's going to continue to talk to your partner about quitting drinking and, erm, give you a chance to do more research and, you know, maybe go through those pamphlets and just come back and tell a little bit more about what you thought about the information and what feels right for you. Is that something that you would be open to?"
"Yes, I think so - I think that would be a good idea, and maybe you could help me, yes, with ways to address it, because I think my partner has the same view that I had."
"In any case, we can discuss this again at our next meeting. Thank you for coming to see me."
"Yes, thank you."
"Hi Andrea, thank you for coming."
Hello. Thank you.
"So I don't know how much you already know about my role here and why you're here in the first place, so I thought I'd start by telling you a little bit about myself."
Okay.
"Basically, my job is to meet with all the students. I meet with everyone about once or twice a semester and just talk to them a little bit about how things are going, what behaviors you might be dealing with, and what changes you might want to make to your life if you decide you are going to do it. It's not my job to change you. I couldn't even do it if I wanted to. That's not my job at all. It's really to help you think about how things are going for you and how you want to make changes or move forward."
Okay.
Does that sound right?
Yes.
Good. So why not start by telling me a bit about yourself?
"Sure. Er, as you know, I'm Andrea, I'm, er, I'm a junior, I'm in the brass band. I play tenor sax."
"Oh, neat."
"Yes, I'm in it - I'm a bit of a band freak. [Laughter] I play, you know, in the brass ensemble and in the jazz band, things like that."
Wow. You are really involved in the music.
"Yes, [counter conversation]."
When did you start?
"Oh, I started playing about 10 years ago."
Wow.
"Yes, I started with the violin first, and then I went on, explored a little with the piano, the clarinet, finally found the tenor saxophone, and yes."
"Very cool. I've always wanted to be good at music. [Laughter] Okay, so it sounds like you're in a band and a few other musical ensembles, have some other hobbies or do things you like to do for fun?"
"Um, you know, just hanging out with my friends or going to the beach, things like that."
Mm-hmm.
Yes.
Just everyday stuff?
Yes (laughs).
Okay. Tell me something about your family.
"Er, I have an older brother who is about eight and a half years older than me. Me and my parents have a dog [laughs]."
Cute. What kind of dog?
He's a golden retriever.
"Oh, all right."
My big boy.
[laughs] Very funny. All right. And how is it going for you at school?
They are pretty good. Marks were pretty ok. Still like 3.7 ish.
"Okay, great, so you're fine. What are your goals after college, oh, after high school?"
"Er, I'd love to, you know, I'd love to graduate high school, hopefully go to a nice Ivy League school."
Oh yes.
"But I mean, that can't happen, and then I want to go on to be a doctor, study psychology and then become a psychiatrist or something."
"Okay, you have some pretty big dreams."
Yes.
"That's great, that's really exciting to think about."
Yes.
"Well, one thing I'm going to ask you about is, um, you know, different people have different things that they really value in their lives, whether it's their cultural identity, or their family, or their friends, or their work, or their hobbies, things like that. So here's the little sheet that just goes through some basic values that, um, might be more or less important to certain people."
Mm-hmm.
"Like belonging or community. Again cultural identity or family, friendship, modesty, religion, respect, self-determination and spirituality. So when you think about yourself, which of these are most important to you in terms of your life?"
"Um, I think a sense of community and belonging."
Okay.
"I think those two and, um, respect."
"Respect, okay. Can you explain to me a little bit why you chose these three?"
"Yeah. Well, I think community and belonging, I kind of connected them together. Um, you know how I said I was in the brass band?"
Mm-hmm.
"I really enjoy being on this team, you know, being with other people and working together toward that one goal."
Mm-hmm.
"And then in terms of respect, I-I kind of view that as one of like my major like rules 。 Like, I-I really think respect is important to respect myself and those around me, so 。"
Okay.
I attach great importance to this.
"Okay, great, so the way you're part of a group and being part of a team gives you a sense of, um, er, belonging, as you said."
Mm-hmm.
"And, in a way, a kind of single-mindedness."
"Yes, the purpose."
And then the respect is really all-encompassing.
Yes.
"Not just authority, but respect for yourself, respect for your teammates or bandmates and other people around you. Okay, that's great."
"Anyway, that's right."
"Well, erm, one of the things I wanted to talk to you about is your affiliation and your friends. So what are the things you like to do when you get together with your friends?"
"Um, sometimes we just go to the movies, to the beach, as I said, or sometimes we just meet up at someone's house, play some good board games and hang out."
"Mm-hmm, and if you're hanging out with friends, is there any alcohol involved?"
"Yes, sometimes."
Okay. Can you tell me something about how alcohol fits into your social scene?
"Er, well, it's mostly just for, for, parties or parties to get things going and loosen things up, as they say."
"Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. And when you go to parties, is there usually alcohol involved?"
Yes.
Okay. And how many times do you think you would say that you drink?
"I would say, erm, on a month off, I would say two or three weekends a month."
Mm-hmm. So about half the time you drink and half the time you don't drink. Can you tell me what is different from not drinking on the days you decide to drink?
"The days when we drink are mostly, as I said, it's parties, so it's more of this whole party and dancing and, you know, everyone's having fun, and if we don't, it's much more relaxed. It's a lot more hanging out, playing board games, watching a movie, that's not yes."
"So it really depends on what the activity is, whether alcohol will be involved or not."
Absolutely.
Okay. And do you notice a big difference or can you tell me something about the difference in your enjoyment level at a party compared to a night playing board games?
"Um, I see them as different, I think, you know, like board games and other things, it's supposed to be relaxing."
Mm-hmm.
So it's nice to have such a breath.
Er-huh.
"- Compared to a party, it is much more energetic, er, after all, it is very draining."
Mm-hmm.
But at the moment it's fun to dance and have fun.
Okay. So there are advantages and disadvantages on both sides?
Yes.
Okay. What are the things you like about drinking or alcohol?
"Um, it's, you know, when we drink, we tend to have more fun because I don't think we all drink together. We're much more relaxed and relaxed."
Mm-hmm.
"- and not really thinking about stress or things like that, but it can be - if it drinks too much, it can be - obviously can be bad."
"Okay, so could you tell me some of the less good or less good things about alcohol if I drink too much or sometimes drink too much?"
"Um, often it will make people stupid. (laughs) Yeah, you know, people make stupid decisions and things like that. We - we usually try to be as safe as possible."
Mm-hmm.
"So we like to sleep with a friend at home. And with that, you know, we don't drive, and mostly within our group of friends. So we don't worry about strangers putting strange things in our drinks."
Mm-hmm.
"But, um, definitely some of the ideas that people can have when they're stupid - when they're drunk and can be really stupid."
"Mm-hmm. So you try not to get involved in really dangerous activities, as you said?"
""
"You try to stay calm, you don't drive. You try to stay with people you trust. Um, but still, it sounds like from time to time, a few things still happen."
Sometimes. Yes.
Can you tell me something about this?
"Well, I especially don't like it when I or one of my friends drink too much and we end up vomiting or something I don't like - that's not fun."
Yes. Throwing is never fun.
But it isn't.
And how often do you think that happens?
"For me, it happened once. It was the first time I had been drinking and it was - it was a lot, I didn't know what I was doing. I was mixing all sorts of strange things and just taking everything with me - someone gave me everything."
Mm-hmm.
- and it did not end well.
Mm-hmm.
"But after that I didn't - but I have friends who still do sometimes, so I'll end up having to look after them or something else."
Okay.
It's kind of a downer for me - for my fun.
"Er-huh. Okay. So, on the one hand, some of the funny things associated with alcohol are just more relaxed, sorta, er, carefree you can kind of let go a little bit more, on the other hand, I think there's a bit more planning."
Yes.
"- because you have to make sure you make it safe or as safe as possible. And then, erm, it can have some other consequences, like vomiting or, even if you're not, getting stuck sometimes - your fun is kind of ruined when you're dealing with a friend who's been drinking too much. Okay. And the other not so good things about alcohol?"
"Yes. People can get a bit sloppy, I guess. How they're all loose, like when people in curves do things that should be done in private life."
Mm-hmm.
- and things like that.
So you're kind of stuck being exposed to things you don't have to see.
Yes.
"Okay. Um, all right. Well, you mentioned a couple of times that you made some decisions to limit the dangerous aspect of drinking. Why did you make those decisions?"
"I have, you know, an aunt who is an alcoholic. So I-I see the problems that are at stake, and I've seen movies and things that I know drunken driving is a problem."
Mm-hmm.
"So, you know, I want to be as safe as possible and be in an environment where we can let go but still be safe like someone's house or the way my parents will tell me, but I know there are dangers and I think I want to limit that."
Mm-hmm.
And then I'll be where I want to be.
"Okay. Yes, it sounds kind of like your, um, your value of respect for yourself."
Yes.
"On the one hand, drinking may help the community that belongs to it start."
Mm-hmm.
"If there is too much, then somehow -"
Then does it somehow miss the point? [laughs]
"Right. And then with respect, one of the things you mentioned is really wanting to respect yourself and not to cross any boundaries, not any boundaries."
Yes.
"Er, how do you think drinking goes with it?"
In terms of what? In terms of respect?
Mm-hmm.
"I think, in a way, I think that drinking is probably a form of disrespect to my own body because I don't put things in - I put things in that shouldn't be there."
Okay.
"And then -- But in terms of what it's like to respect myself, I respect myself by trying to stay in someone's house and how I try to limit my drinking so that I don't get into this blackout, like vomiting and everything."
Mm-hmm.
"And try to let go, you know, but still keep control of my behavior, so that I don't go somewhere with a person I'm visiting."
Mm-hmm.
"-I do not know where, I do not know what, and"
Mm-hmm.
Things like that.
"Okay, so you're looking for that balance."
Yes.
"-about how much you can drink to have some of the positive benefits, but not to overlook them."
"Okay. And what did you come up with at that point? Do you have some kind of A-A boundary to hold on to, or is it you?"
"I would start off as if I was making sure I was making my own drink so I know what's in it and how much is in it. So I control how much I drink. So, normally I just take one of those cups and then make a drink and then I try to hold it for as long as possible and I would be like, ""Well, that's my only drink"" and I'm good that way. I still have something in my mug so people aren't like, ""Oh, here. Have something else."" I'd be like to be like, ""No, I'm good. I've got mine"" and I'd still have something I'd like to let go a little bit."
Mm-hmm. Okay. And do you feel that it works pretty well for you or do you sometimes cross that line or what do you think?
"On the whole, it works pretty well, because, as I said, people, you know, people come to me and ask me, try to put pressure on me, I'm going to be like, ""No, I'm good. I have - you know, I have something else. I'll get something later."" And in the end, I never get anything. Oh, but sometimes they're going to be like, ""Hey, let's take a shot,"" and everyone's going to gather around me like the kitchen or something that's ready to take a shot, and then I'm going to be like, ""Oh, well, maybe I can take another one."" And then I start to, you know, fall into me."
Okay.
- far too much.
"So, uh, uh, part of the time you're doing well and part of the time you might like."
Yes.
-would like to make some adjustments -
Mm-hmm.
"Okay. So how important is it to think in that direction, make a few changes or make some adjustments to your drinking to somehow reconcile with your values and your goals for yourself?"
"Um, I want to make sure that, you know, in terms of respect for myself and my body, I would try to drink less."
Okay.
"Like I-I-know, it's nice to let go and have fun, but I also want it to be like, you know, I don't harm my body, you know."
Correct.
How my liver won't work when I'm 22.
Mm-hmm.
"And, erm, you know, you have my friends on board with a similar mentality so that we can kind of work on it as a group, as a community."
Er-huh. So you combine them all.
Yes.
"How important is it for you to work towards this goal, on a scale of one to ten, where one is not important at all and ten is the most important?"
I would say six or seven like-minded people.
"Oh, okay."
"I would like to work on it, but you know, if I can do it, then I can do it. If I can't do it, then I can't do it."
Er-huh. Why do you say six or seven and not like a four?
"Um, because I still think it's important."
Er-huh.
"Like I said, I don't want to hurt my body, especially when I go to school, how I know how things affect your body and also your social life, your schoolwork and so on. I know that once I'm in college it won't work - it won't work to drink every weekend and then try to wake up early and go to school, take an exam."
"Yes, if you look ahead, you can't carry on drinking like this and achieve the goals you have for yourself."
Yes.
"Okay. Well, how confident are you that you could cut back if you wanted to?"
I believe that I am in a position to defuse the situation.
- on the same scale from one to ten?
"I think when I make the decision I would make, I definitely think I'm like a 10 that I know would go through."
"Oh, wow. Okay. Why do you say 10?"
"It's just because I know that when I make the decision, I know I can do it. It's the decision from the start."
"Okay. And so you mentioned them - you know, a whole bunch of reasons why you would like to cut back. Um, did you even think about how you would do that?"
"Um, I might think about trying to convince my friends without sounding, you know, village or something, and like, hey, you know, let's just stay in today. Like, let's not go out or something like that. Or just like, hey, I don't like it - I don't drink today. And even if my friends do, they like to be okay with them, to drink around me and not do it, and then they're okay when I drink - I don't drink and they do what they want."
"So kind of, um, trying to plan more activities that don't involve drinking alcohol."
Yes.
"- and then also to try to participate in activities without drinking yourself, or perhaps even drinking less than you drink yourself."
Yes.
Okay. Does that sound like a goal you want to work on now or not?
I think so. I think it's very doable. I think it's possible.
"Okay. Um, so we'll probably talk about, um, less alcohol activity. I'll just take a few notes and then maybe, um, I'll reduce the amount of drinking you do when alcohol is involved. Okay. Um, so that goal sounds feasible, you said? Would it be okay if we met in a couple of weeks to see how it goes?"
"I think so, and that's a good thing."
Does that sound like something you'd like to do?
Yes.
"Okay. Well, I really appreciate it when you spend time with me, you know, it sounds like you have a lot of really good goals for yourself, really ambitious goals, to go to medical school and, you know, to become a psychiatrist or, erm, some other kind of doctor. Um, you're really looking forward to doing well in school to get there."
"And it sounds like you have a pretty active social life and a lot of friends that you think are likely to be, er, supportive, even if you drink less alcohol and that, you know, there are a lot of benefits that you see both for your body and for your health, er, your academic performance and even some of the social stuff in terms of a sense of belonging, without having to deal with some of the gross consequences of, er, excessive drinking."
"Um, yeah, you know, it really sounds to me like you have a good plan, and as long as you're willing and interested to meet again, I'd be very happy to talk to you about how it's going."
"Yes, I would."
Good. Great. So I'll see you in a few weeks.
Perfect.
Great.
"Hello, nice to meet you again. And, erm, what seems to be the problem or what made you come along?"
"Er, I'm just fed up with drinking. I drink too much. Er, I just thought, uh, maybe I need someone to talk to to to help me with that."
"Okay, so do you feel that drinking is a problem for you right now?"
"Yes, it's true - it's only got worse in the last six months?"
Okay. Wh-What makes you say it got worse?
"Well, I think I was drinking, you know, like most people do before, um, but I split up with my boyfriend about a year ago, uh, and then six months ago I probably wanted to go out again and see if I could meet people."
Okay.
"And I got used to, yes, this habit of going out every Friday and Saturday, now, er, drinking a lot."
Yes.
"Um, trying to get to know people."
Sure.
"And, uh, in the last few months, I've been drinking, you know, even more during the week, and I've never done that before."
"Okay, okay, so you've noticed, I think, erm, especially the last six months since you made up your mind, you know what? I'm going to take a risk and go out to try to meet a potential partner again, that it's going to be accompanied by an increase in drinking."
"Yeah. Well, I just don't feel comfortable talking to guys normally. [giggles]"
Okay.
"I don't know what to say, er, and I just know drinking helps."
"Sure, sure. So you realize that drinking at the moment might be a way to calm the nerves?"
"Yes, for sure."
To get in touch with potential partners?
"Yes, absolutely."
"Who-who-who, guys?"
Yes.
Okay.
"I mean, like most people, when they go out, they drink too."
Okay.
"I did that and I just kept drinking more and more, I think."
Sure.
"Um, and that's right - it doesn't even work, I don't really meet people and in the end I just have a massive hangover for the rest of the weekend and -"
"That's interesting, isn't it? Because you kind of mentioned it there, like on one side of the medal, erm, it helps to calm the nerves, to get out of there and"
Yes.
"talk to the boys at the same time, on the other hand, what you find doesn't work, and i-i-it leads to hangovers, does it?"
"Yeah, I mean, I may have talked to people, but it's just like, erm, I think I'm just too drunk and I'm just, my friends are driving me home and I just don't have the end of the night - yeah."
"Okay, so I think, you know, given the circumstances, what would you like to do?"
I think I just want to stop. I just feel like I'm drinking more and more because I'm doing it on weekdays now.
Yes.
"- and I mean, I just don't do it - I don't want to do it every now and then, I just think it's a bit too much."
Okay.
"Yes, I just don't eat properly anymore, I just eat less or I just get takeaway food, crap."
Okay.
"-Um, I'm just, I feel like I'm not training - well, I'm not exercising as much as I used to. So, I just want to cut, you know, stop drinking so much."
"Okay, okay, so does that sound like you really want to stop drinking, especially on weekdays?"
"Yes. Yes, I do. Yes."
"Correct, because you notice that it has a negative effect on what you eat."
"Yes. I don't want - I don't want, I mean, I don't want to stop completely like that."
"No, I get it. Yes. I mean, you know, it sounds like it, it's helpful to you to a certain extent when you go out, because it makes you feel a little more calm to talk to people, doesn't it?"
"Yes, and all my friends go out and drink."
Yes.
'I wouldn't have a social life if I didn't have it.
Yes.
"If I just said, ""No, I don't drink at all,"" and, you know, I don't feel like an alcoholic."
Sure.
- or I don't feel I have to do it
"The social element of hanging out with friends and going out together is something that is very pleasant, so it's not about removing it completely, it's about, ""Okay, I realize that it affects me more than I would like."" Yes. Yes, okay."
"Yes, it's just a bit out of control."
Were there times in the past when you tried to limit your drinking?
"No, there has never been such a thing."
"Oh, this is the first time something like this has come up?"
"Um, just because of the circumstances, I mean, I just had my boyfriend for six years before that and -"
"Yes, yes."
"Um, before that, only my friends didn't drink that much, and yes, it's just not, it's just new. Yes."
"Okay, yes. Well, it's great that you're able to see what's going on right now, and not only do you know that, you've almost picked up a certain pattern you're going into."
Mm-hmm.
"As for reducing alcohol consumption, you know, on a scale of 0 to 100 and 100, er, that means it's hugely important for you and 0 is not important at all. How important is it for you to reduce your drinking?"
"I think 80, I mean, that's probably why I'm here."
"Okay, yes, of course, you're already taking a big step forward in many ways by coming along and starting talking about it."
Yes.
"Um, I guess 80 is pretty high, what makes you say an 80 over 50?"
"Um, I don't know, I just don't know, it just sort of - it just got to the point where it just, um, just seemed too much, like no one else really drinks that much a week and -"
Okay.
"- It seemed that for the reasons I said, I simply had to do something about it."
"Okay, yes, so there's a real sense of, ""I need to do something."""
"Just to see it get worse, er, wha-- it seems."
Or so it seems.
Yes.
"So right now it's a case of the last six months, it's a pattern that you've noticed more and more, um, a sign that it's had a negative impact on your lifestyle that you're not happy with and you're in a position where you know what? I want to do something about it."
Yes.
"Okay, I mean, what do you think is the next step?"
"Um, that's probably why I'm here. [giggles]"
Yes.
"Just to, erm, but um- I am - I think the weekdays are what I really need to do."
Okay.
"Um, and then, I don't know, try to plan it a bit more at the weekend."
Okay.
- so that it just doesn't go crazy.
"Okay, okay, so are you thinking about maybe trying to keep weekdays free of alcohol? Was that what you said?"
"Yes, yes."
"Okay, how does that sound to you as a first step?"
"No, that's good, that's, yeah, that's, that's - that's definitely what I'm going to do."
Okay.
"I'm just so out of my routine, I'm not training, I've got to get back into things."
"Okay, you sound really crazy about turning the rudder around."
"Yes, but I mean, I think if I just talk about it, I think, oh yes, I have to do this - I have to do something about it."
"Okay, oh, that's great, okay."
"So, Jacob, everything looks normal during your physical examination. Do you have any questions for me?"
No.
"Okay. I see that you have filled out our, um, alcohol and drug questionnaire. Is it okay for us to go through this together?"
Sure.
Okay. What we're talking about is confidential. I'm only telling your parents what we're saying if you give your permission or if I'm afraid of a danger to you or someone else. Does that make sense?
Yes.
"Okay. So let's take a look at it. So I see that you have noticed that you sometimes consume alcohol and that you have used alcohol to relax, to feel better or to fit in."
"It's not a big deal. Sometimes we have a few beers with my friends and when we hang out or go to a party, and sometimes rum and coke."
"Okay, how many do you usually have at once?"
"Um, probably three or four."
Okay. And how often?
"Um, probably once or twice a month."
Okay. So you drink three or four beers or mixed drinks with friends once or twice a month. How long have you been doing this?
Probably since last October.
"So, for about six months. I'm curious: What do you like about alcohol consumption?"
What do I like about it?
Yes.
"Um, I don't know. It's just fun to drink with my friends, like when we're at someone else's party, and we drink with other people we don't know. It tastes good."
Okay. So it sounds like you feel relaxed and have fun drinking with friends and you like the taste.
Mm-hmm.
"Okay. I'm also curious, are there any passages about your alcohol consumption that you don't like?"
"Um, I don't like it when I get sick in the morning because I have a hangover."
Mm-hmm.
"- If I start puking, it's not - I don't like that."
Have you ever experienced a power cut when you've been drinking and wake up unable to remember what happened?
"No, but it happened to someone I know."
"Okay. And did you have any problems related to your alcohol consumption, like at home, at school or elsewhere?"
"Um, once I missed my first day of school because I had a hangover and got up late."
Mm-hmm.
"Mm, Mum got mad at me for not getting out of bed and she said she knew I had a hangover."
Mm-hmm. Did you tell your mother that you drink with your friends?
"No, but after that I was grounded for two weeks. [giggles]"
"So more negative things about your drinking, like getting in trouble with your mother and missing a class at school when you had a hangover?"
"Yes, but I only missed school once."
"Okay. I see on the questionnaire that you didn't drive with someone in the car who was drinking, and that you didn't drive a car, um, after you drank. Is that true?"
Yes.
"As your doctor, I want you to know that I am worried about your drinking. When teenagers drink, things can go wrong, such as injuring yourself, but even if you do not drink too much, your brain still develops and is very sensitive to the effects of alcohol."
Okay.
"That is why I recommend to all my young patients not to drink at all. So, if you think today about how ready you feel to stop drinking alcohol on a scale of zero to ten, with zero not ready at all and ten feeling very ready, what number would you choose?"
"Er, probably a five."
"A five? So, I'm curious: Why didn't you choose a lower number like a two or three, which would mean you're just a bit willing to stop drinking?"
"Well, I think I'm just sick of getting into trouble."
Okay. What can you do to avoid getting into trouble?
"Er, don't drink."
[giggles] Have you ever tried not to drink or stop drinking?
"No, not really."
"Okay. Some people your age try to stop drinking for a while, just to see how it feels."
I probably could.
So for how long do you think you could give up drinking?
I don't know.
Do you think you could go two months without drinking?
"Yes, probably."
Okay. What things would make it easier for you not to drink?
"Um, I could probably drink something else if my friends were drinking, like just coke."
Is there anything else that could make things easier for you?
I can probably hang out with some of my friends who don't drink or don't invite them to parties and have fun because not everyone drinks at parties.
"Okay. Is there anyone in your life you can talk to about it, who can help you not to drink?"
"Yes. My friends who don't drink would probably be happy that I don't drink and yes, they would support me."
"And you've developed some strategies to try not to drink, like spending more time with friends who don't drink, or drinking non-alcoholic drinks when people around you are drinking alcohol. I think that's a great plan. I'm really proud of you for giving it a try. How about if I let you make an appointment in two months and then I see you again and we'll see how things go?"
Okay.
"So, Rick, just in terms of your current roommate situation with Tristan. Er, you know, we talked about how we go through this program and with the support of your parents and have a positive impact to help you with that. I just want to change your mind a little bit if you stay with Tristan. What are the pros and cons of it? What are the good things to live there, what are the less good things to live there?"
"Oh, it's a nice place. It's close to work. It's a good life with a partner."
"Yes. So, in terms of support and some kind of support, you're going to have to make those changes."
Yes.
What do you think?
"That's the thing, isn't it? I am - I don't know if it's the best place for me if I'm going to make these changes."
Mm-hmm.
And Tristan is a good roommate.
Yes.
I don't have any - we're going in different directions now. He doesn't have the same kind of responsibilities that I have and stuff - and I can't expect him to change his whole life just because I want to change mine.
Correct.
But I don't know how much I'd like to move in with my aunt and uncle.
"Okay. You're good to explore, but I just want to ask you how much Chris-Christian-Christian knows - Tristan knows you're changing your life? What does he really know about the changes you want to make?"
"I sit down and talk to him, ask him about, um, support and so on and he's all, he says he's going to be there for me. But, like I said, he's, um, he's in a different place in his life than I am in mine."
Mm-hmm.
He has no children.
Correct.
"He doesn't know -- I don't know if he can really understand what it means to me. Um, he's a good mate."
"Okay. What are some of the advantages and disadvantages of moving in with whāna, moving in with your aunt and uncle?"
"The food would be good. Um, I would get support - my whānau is really supportive, but I'm worried about losing - I'm worried about losing my freedom. I'm worried, um, about them taking over, or, you know what I mean? I have a freedom where I am now, I'm responsible for myself. That would probably be really good."
"In terms of that freedom and responsibility for yourself, and the changes that we're talking about, and building your own family, and to allow you to do that, where does some of that freedom stuff sit when you get back to dealing with your whānau and your children, your partner? Is it something that you want to hold on to, or how you're going to do it?"
"I don't want to hold on to freedom if that's the case - if it means losing my children. Um, I'm just worried, er, I'm worried when I move in with my family that even if their intentions are good,"
Mm-hmm.
I don't know. I will do everything I can to get my children back.
"Hi Sarah, it is great to meet you. My name is Delwyn and I am a consultant here at the clinic, and I heard from your nurse that you recently took an annual exam that covered smoking and alcohol consumption."
"Yeah, erm, I met with my nurse last week and I think she's worried about how much I'm smoking and drinking right now. I mean, me and I agreed that I would work on smoking and try to limit that, but when it comes to drinking, I don't really think I'm drinking that much."
"So you have decided that you want to reduce your smoking a little, but you are not really worried about your drinking."
"Right, I mean, I don't drink that much and, to be honest, it's just a good way to relax."
It's a nice way of relieving stress.
"Yes, exactly. You know, it's kind of like I have time at the end of the day."
A kind of escape from the hectic schedule.
"Yes. You know, I have a two-year-old son, and then I work full-time, and I started going back to school, too. You know, I'm just trying to juggle all that stuff. You know, it's tiring, and so, you know, at the end of the day, I want to relax and have fun."
"So you work, and then, on top of that, you juggle being a single mother and going to school?"
"Yes, and for work, you know, I'm a server. So I'm on my feet all day, you know, and it's really exhausting."
It's pretty exhausting work.
"Yes, you know, it's hard to try and make it right for the customers all day. And then, at the same time, I'm worried, am I making enough money to feed my son, you know?"
"So not only do you do a really hard job and go to school, but you also worry about your finances."
"Yes, and then, you know, when I go back to school, you know, I have to figure out how I'm going to pay for everything."
"Yes, that's right. It sounds like a lot to struggle with, and it makes sense that you feel like you need some kind of break or reward."
Mm-hmm.
"So tell me a bit more about your drinking. Tell me a bit about how much you drink, and, er, about the pattern and what has caused concern."
"I-I don't really understand what caused the concern. I mean, I don't drink that much, you know. I-I only drank two drinks a day at most, you know."
"So maybe you drink two drinks a day. Um, and I wonder, what did you hear about the recommendations for alcohol levels?"
Not much.
"Okay, will you be interested to hear these recommendations?"
Sure.
"Okay. So, the recommendation for women is to drink no more than three drinks a day, and no more than seven drinks over the course of a week. Yes, er, and really, the reason for these recommendations is simply to reduce the risk that people have problems with accidents or chronic diseases, such as certain cancers or high blood pressure and then mental health problems. I don't know what you think of all this?"
"I don't know, i-it just surprises me because I mean, two drinks a day, that-that doesn't seem to be a problem or risky, you know. And I have family members who drink a lot more than that a day, and for them it's not a problem. So i-it just surprises me."
"It just doesn't seem so abnormal to you, especially when you compare it to your family."
"No. And then, I don't know, I - I'm just a little annoyed, to be honest, because, you know, I agreed that I was going to try to work on my smoking, you know. But, with all this drinking, it's like taking away everything I enjoy now, and so when I stop drinking, like, what am I going to have to have to have to have fun, you know."
"Yes, you really do feel that you need that reward."
"Yes, yes."
And then it also sounds as if your alcohol consumption may have increased a little over time?
"Yeah, I mean, I think so. Probably just because I'm so stressed every day, you know. I mean, I'm in the second semester of school right now, and stuff like that, and adding that to everything, uh, that's a lot. And, you know, I'm trying to figure out how to carry kids. Um, normally my mom will be watching my son, but lately she can't always do that. So I'm always kind of worried about how, will she be able to do that, you know. So, i-it's just stressful."
"Yes, and it sounds as though the more stressed you feel, the more you realise you're drinking."
"Yes, I think it is."
"So let me summarize a little of what you said to me. It sounds like you have a pretty hectic, stressful life, and you really feel that you have some kind of"
Er-huh.
"- Reward or relieve stress. Um, and then on the other hand, you noticed, er, that your alcohol consumption has increased a bit over time. Also, the more stressed you are, the more you feel like drinking."
Yes.
"So I wonder, have you noticed any problems with your drinking?"
"No. I think, you know, the only thing I can think of is that there are going to be nights where I just want to get my son to bed a little bit earlier just so I have time to relax, you know, maybe I smoke, have a few drinks. Um, but sometimes I feel guilty because I should enjoy spending time with my son, but instead I just want to be by myself and relax, you know."
So you have noticed that it starts to call you a little in the evening.
Yes.
And maybe it takes you away from things that are more important to you?
Yes.
And it doesn't feel good?
No.
"Yes. And so it sounds like there's a bit of a dilemma because - and I think we should be aware that it's not the occasional drink that's a problem. Um, it's - it's really the amount of drinking, and - and whether your drinking escalates and interferes in things that are perhaps more important."
Yes.
And you may never have seen it in that light before.
"No. And, i-it's just, it's really hard to record it now. I mean, yeah. I-I've never thought about it like that before. And, you know, I-I feel kind of troubled."
I think it would be a pretty hard pattern to change.
"Yes. I mean, i-it is part of my routine at the moment, and, you know, I-I don't want to sacrifice anything that I enjoy, but, you know, I'm trying really hard to be a good mom. I'm-I'm trying, you know, to go back to school. I'm trying to work. So, I don't know how to do all of this if I don't have a way to have fun or relax, you know?"
So it looks like it's really hard to change something because it's something that's really important to you right now.
Yes.
"But on the other hand, it sounds as if there are things you value and don't want to disturb."
Yes.
So I wonder if you have thought about how you can deal with stress without relying so much on drinking.
"Well, you know, if there was a way to relieve some of my stress, I think I'd be better off and, you know, maybe I wouldn't feel like I had to relax in the same way at night."
"So if you could somehow tackle some of these stressful issues, um, it could make a difference, and what - what would it be, for example?"
"Um, you know, probably my biggest problem is childcare. You know, my mom usually watches my son, but she's kind of withdrawn lately, so I'm worried, am I going to have to go to work today, am I going to have to miss classes? You know, the worry about it is really stressful, you know."
So more reliable childcare could make a big difference.
"Yes, absolutely."
"And it sounds as though your mother has been an option in the past, but perhaps not so much."
"Yes. I mean, she's watching him so much. I think she's probably getting stressed as well, and I feel bad because it's not her son, so it shouldn't be her problem, but I need something I can rely on better."
"So one thing that could make a big difference is if you could find more reliable, affordable childcare that would help you not drink so much."
Yes.
Anything else?
"Well, I mean, most of my problems always come back to money. You know, me - if I had more money, I could afford a day care center, I could work less hours, you know? So, yes. Usually it's money."
"Yes. It sounds like money can make a big difference, and you're working full-time and trying to go to school to deal with it in the long run. Um, but on the other hand, you know, it sounds like you have some other ideas on how to deal with stress better. Um, so, I think I wonder where you stand with everything we've talked about so far."
"Um, we started talking about how your drinking has drifted into some kind of risky area, and it would be wise to scale back. Um, but it sounds like that's pretty important to you and not necessarily something you want to do. But, on the other hand, we talked about how it might be made a little bit easier, but I'm not sure you're ready to tackle that or pursue it now. I just wonder where you are."
"Yes. I mean, I'm ready to think about changing my drinking, but as far as I'm actually doing it, I don't know. I mean, I have a lot of problems that I'm trying to solve."
"So, erm, maybe it would be helpful if you could limit it to just one thing, and what would that be?"
"Childcare, probably."
"Okay. Yes. It sounds like everything you say, it always comes up as one of the main problems. Um, so maybe there are some resources I can point you to, but I wonder if you were looking for alternatives, more affordable, more reliable childcare?"
"I mean, I usually just see if my mom can watch my son, so I didn't really look around."
"Okay. One thing you could consider is talking to one of our social workers who specializes in helping people who have a lot on their plate to identify resources they might need, er, things you haven't thought about or are unaware of. So, I don't know, would you be interested in doing that?"
"Yes, absolutely."
"Okay. Great. Well, I can definitely set this up for you, and you can"
Mm-hmm.
"-Um, are you trying to, um, address your childcare problem, um, with a little help? Is there anything else you would like to do, er, would you be interested in talking to me again, um, how things are progressing?"
"Yes, I think I would. I mean, it was nice to just talk about everything that was going on."
"Yes. So these are not problems that will disappear in a week. It will take some time to solve them. Okay, great. So, erm, it sounds like we have a few things to pursue, erm."
Mm-hmm.
Anything else?
Millimetre-millimetre
Would you think about setting a goal for yourself in terms of your drinking?
"Well, I mean, I could at least try to go back to one drink a night instead of two."
Okay. Try to shorten it a little and see how it goes.
"Yes, I mean, I don't know what's going to happen, especially with the attempt to reduce smoking already, but I think I can try."
"Okay. So, you can try it and, I mean, when you manage it, you might learn a little bit about how easy or difficult it is going to be, and also what it is like to deal with stress in a different way."
Yes.
"Okay. So it sounds like we have two paths to follow, anything else?"
I don't think so.
"Okay. That sounds good, so why don't we meet again in a couple of weeks and you kind of tell me how the reduction in your drinking went and also what it was like when you met with a social worker? Sounds good?"
Yes.
"Okay, great. I look forward to the next conversation."
"Okay, thank you."
"Steve, before we finish our visit today, I wondered if you would be willing to take a few minutes to talk about your drinking."
"Okay, what?"
"Thank you very much. I just wanted to check a few things here. I noticed that you said that you drink two or three times a week, drink three or four drinks at a time if you drink, and drink more weekly, um, so six or more drinks, it says here."
Mm-hmm.
Does that sound realistic?
"Yes, er, on weekends?"
"Okay, okay. I just wanted you to know that I am a little concerned about your alcohol level. We know that excessive drinking can exacerbate problems or even sometimes cause health problems, and I just wondered if you thought about the connection between your drinking and things like the anxiety and insomnia you are facing today?"
"No, I don't think I've really thought about it much. Um, you know, I don't really think I drink that much at all."
Mm-hmm.
- so I find it hard to believe that it is causing my anxiety.
Mm-hmm.
"In fact, I find it harder to fall asleep on nights when I don't drink."
"Well, you're not alone, many people think that drinking helps them sleep better, and in reality drinking can make you fall asleep faster, but it has the so-called rebound effect, and this rebound effect means that you wake up in the middle of the night or early in the morning, possibly wake up and find it hard to fall asleep again."
"Well, I, yes, I guess I have a subscription at about 2: 00 in the morning, I tend to wake up on the nights when I drink too much."
"Mm-hmm. Well, I just wanted to show you this little chart: For your age as a man, you drink more than low-risk people. Um, the low-risk level for men under 65 is no more than 14 drinks a week and no more than four a day. And in that case, a drink is considered 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or one and a half ounces of distilled spirits. And you're right, you don't drink as much as some people out there. So, as you answered our questions here, you actually fall into the high-risk category, the risky or dangerous category, category two."
"Jeez, no. I didn't think I was that bad."
"On a scale of 1-10, the question arises: How great is your willingness to change, 1 being that I do not want to change at all, and 10 is that I really want to change?"
"I don't know. I mean, this is all news to me. I have, I don't want to do anything to endanger myself, and I've always thought of myself as a pretty healthy guy. I guess I would have put myself in the middle of the five."
"That is halfway there. What stopped you from simply giving him one or two, something lower?"
"Well, you know, I'm training for the marathon, and that's why I'm coming in, because I need to be able to get my sleep going again, but I don't consider myself a dangerous drinker, and I'm certainly not an alcoholic. So, that's why the middle way, five."
"Mm-hmm. Okay. Well, that's a good starting point. So, I heard you say your health is important, and you're preparing to run a marathon, so you want to be able to do everything to make it successful. And you were also a little surprised that you fell into this risky or dangerous category."
Yes.
"Okay. Based on all this information, what are you willing to think about what to do to change right now?"
"Well, I think the natural thing would be to scale back my drinking a little bit."
Mm-hmm. What would that look like for you?
"Mm, er, you know, me - I guess I don't drink more than maybe three or four times a week, and on weekends, where I drink the most, I don't drink more than five or six beers."
"Okay, okay. Well, sometimes when people aren't willing to make such changes, it helps when they write down their goals, it gives them a chance to see them in black and white. If you looked at that little form here and found out where you want to go with your drinking, what would you set as your goal?"
"Er, I reckon I don't drink more than 18 drinks a week."
"Okay. So that's an improvement, so you're moving in the right direction. I want to tell you that with 18 drinks a week you're still above that low risk category and that it would be my recommendation that you drop below that 14 or less a week at some point, but it's an improvement and it's a great starting point and I really commend you for your willingness to look at that and try to make some improvements."
Thank you.
So I hope that when you are appointed next month we can touch on the basis of that and see how it goes.
Sure.
Okay.
"In summary, the Minnesota State Mankato safety report states that you were stopped on the stadium road last Friday for driving under the influence of alcohol and being taken to a detox. Also, the report lists your age as 20. Dylan, what is the veracity of the report? And can you give me some details that led to the incident?"
"I mean, I was kind of drunk and it happened like a week ago. I just drove to my friend's house, erm, just to watch the game and, you know, we had a couple of beers and next thing I know the Vikings were losing pretty big, so we drank a little bit more than usual, and I mean, I had to go home and I couldn't find a ride, so I just drove."
"You decided to drink more than you intended because you were disappointed with the way the Vikings played and when your roommate couldn't give you a ride home, you decided to go home. Did I understand that correctly?"
"Yes. That's exactly what happened. I mean, I'm a normal college kid. I like to drink and hang out with my mates. I mean, it wasn't a big house party or something, and I got smashed."
"Yes, I understand that it was your intention to have a good time while you were watching the game with your friends. You didn't think about what could go wrong when you were a minor drinking alcohol because you were at your friend's house and not at a big party and you were trying to be safe by finding a ride home."
"Yes. I tried to be safe. I mean, I tried to call her roommate, but I don't know, and still got into trouble."
"Dylan, you told me what brought you here today, what do you think is the problem really?"
"Um, I would like to say that I have a drinking problem. I think I would probably have more of a problem like getting caught. I mean, my friends, they - they drink like fish and I - they never get caught and you brought me here and I get caught and they left."
"Sounds like you are attributing your current situation to bad luck. If you believe this and do not try to change your behaviour, what consequences could follow?"
I guess - I think there are more problems with police and school and I really don't have the time or the money for it.
"How important is it that you avoid future problems with the police or school, Dylan?"
"God. I think it's super important because just going to detox was horrible, the experience - I don't want to do it again - and my dad said if I get suspended from school, um, I have to go - I have to go to my uncle's farm in Iowa and that would destroy my social life. I won't see any of my friends and I mean it's bad enough, like my parents took my car away when I got the DUI."
Yes. What would you be willing to do to prevent you from being detoxed and suspended again?
"Well, I guess I wouldn't drink that much, and I try to avoid situations where I'm more likely to get into trouble, so I probably don't want to drink that much."
"How confident are you on a scale of 1 to 10 that you will be able to implement this plan, with 10 being very confident?"
"Um, I think I'd say like, I don't know how halfway. So maybe like a six."
What steps could you take to change that six to a seven or eight?
"I probably could, um, I don't know. I-I guess, well, the big thing would be that I drink like I'm just like in my apartment, then I don't risk driving or like I am - if I go to a party and wait until I'm 21 to drink. Um, maybe I find things that aren't about drinking, like, I think in a city of this size, there has to be more to do than just drink."
In what way could your life be better if you succeed in making the changes you mentioned?
"Um, I mean, I guess the big one would be like I'm going to win - I'm not going to be hungry all the time, like I'm going to make it to my 8: 00 AMs, well, even if I make it to my 8: 00 AMs, I'm going to sleep like I'm waking up like, ""Oh my God, what's going on?"" and then I'm going to get to my 8: 00 AM and just sleep through and then miss pretty much everything that's going to be tested. So I think if I reprioritize what's important to me, I'm probably going to help me succeed. I mean, I had a 3.5 GPA in high school, so I know I could make it here."
"College is all about choices. Can you tell me about your beliefs and values that have influenced your decision-making, and how do those beliefs and values align with the choices you want to make about drinking?"
"Um, my education is really important to me and my family as well. My parents always talk about it and I really want to be an international journalist to be in the news, like, I mean, I have the face for it, um. So I guess if I reset my priorities - if I reprioritize my duties, I don't drink so much. I probably wouldn't disappoint my parents and I could get a really good education."
Thank you for attending today. Your sanction will include being placed on disciplinary probation and attending an alcohol education seminar that will cost $150.
"All right, all right. When is the seminar?"
Would you like to answer a few questions and make a self-assessment of how you feel about alcohol and contraception?
Sure.
"Okay. So we work on a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is unimportant, 10 is very important. One is uncertain, one is very confident, so what number on a scale of 1 to 10 best reflects how important it is for you to drink it - what are the risk limits?"
I'd say an eight.
"You would say an eight. Okay. And on a scale of 1 to 10, how confident are you at present that you can drink below the risk level?"
I'd say a four.
Amount of four.
Mm-hmm.
"Okay. And so we look at these two. You think it's pretty important, but your self-confidence is down here, er, a four, but not a one. What makes you confident that you can drink at risk and you know what that is?"
"Um, I think it's because you told me I was in danger and I have alcoholism in my family and I really don't want to go down that path, so I'm confident I can change that now."
Okay. So that's a good reason not to drink. Okay. Anything else?
"Um, I have a group of friends that I don't drink with, and I think hanging out with them is not a problem, so that helps me."
So you have a self-help group that gives you the opportunity to have fun and still drink at risk?
Yes.
Okay. Anything else?
Nope.
"Now let's look at your self-assessment of your birth control. So let's do the risk of pregnancy and the use of birth control now. So, on a scale of 1 to 10, how important is it to you to use effective birth control every time you have sex to prevent pregnancy?"
I'd say an eight.
"An eighth. Okay. And on a scale of 1 to 10, how confident are you that you can use effective birth control at the moment?"
""
Every time.
- probably a six.
Just as it is prescribed.
Probably a six.
Probably a six. Okay. So you're pretty sure you can do it. And why are you a six and not two or three?
"Um, I'm a six-year-old because I think that if I drink less, I'm more reliable at using contraceptives. I tend not to use them if I drink too much, and I don't really care."
"Okay. So it's kind of related to your drinking, to the fact that you, erm, you can - if you can take care of that drinking, you can take care of that drinking."
Yes.
birth control issue and this importance comes as a reason why you are not down here.
Yes.
"Very good. So it looks like you are using a good method of birth control, you are just not able to use it effectively, and you have linked it here again to drinking. So, today, do you want to develop a plan for your alcohol consumption?"
Before I leave?
Yes.
Okay.
"Okay. And if you need more information, get it from us."
Okay.
Okay.
Do you mind if I look at the questionnaire you filled out before you visit?
Okay.
"Thank you. I want you to know that when patients and I talk about alcohol and drugs, my role is to exchange information and learn from it what they want to do, if anything."
Yes.
Great. So you wrote here that you consumed alcohol on at least eight days last year?
Yes. Somewhere around eight days. I'm not sure.
Okay. How would you describe your drinking?
"Um, I really only drink at parties. I don't drink at home or anything."
Okay. What kind of alcohol do you drink at parties?
"Um, liquor whenever people mix, um, vodka, sometimes beer, but I don't like beer very much. Um, drinks at parties are usually like vodka and orange juice or gin and tonic."
How much do you usually drink at a party?
You mean all the time I'm there?
Yes.
"Um, probably four or five drinks."
"Speaker 1: Okay. You ticked the box here that drinking helps you feel relaxed, feel better or fit in?"
Yes. It gives me a feeling of relaxation.
And you have also checked that sometimes you forget things when you drink.
Yes.
What things do you forget?
"Er, I forget how many drinks I've had when a friend asks me or I forget whose house I'm in."
Sometimes you forget where you stand.
Correct.
"This is because we know that a number of negative things tend to happen when teenagers drink. We know that alcohol can damage the development of the brain as a teenager and teenagers who drink are more likely to injure themselves randomly. Sexual assault is another thing that is more likely, and also sexually transmitted diseases. I'm curious, do you think your drinking has anything to do with the possibility of a venereal disease?"
"Um, yeah. I drank the last time I had sex. Um, the guy drank too, and we didn't use a condom."
Do you remember your consent during sex?
Yes. We have had sex before and we have used a condom before.
How do you think that alcohol consumption this time influences the use of a condom?
"Well, we just didn't stop putting one on. We didn't think so."
Does drinking sound like changing your thinking in those moments?
Yes. I would definitely have told him to put on a condom if I was sober.
"And I would like to share something else: if people forget where they are or how many drinks they have drunk, that is a sign of heavy drinking, and if people continue to drink despite the negative consequences, that can be a sign of what we call an alcohol consumption disorder."
"Well, that's not me. I don't need anyone's help."
I am curious: What do you like about drinking alcohol?
"Um, it's fun. I like to drink when my friends drink too. Um, I laugh more. It's just fun."
Okay. And what about your drinking that you don't like?
"Er, I don't like to forget where I am sometimes."
Anything else?
I really don't want sexually transmitted diseases.
"Right. So on the one hand, you like to feel relaxed and have fun when you drink, and on the other hand, you don't like to forget where you are or how many drinks you have drunk, and you don't like to expose yourself to the risk of sexually transmitted diseases?"
Yes.
"So when you think about what you like about your drinking and what you don't, where do you want to go? What do you want to change about your drinking?"
"Well, I definitely don't want to drink too much again."
"How willing are you not to drink too much? If I asked you to pick a number on a scale from 0 to 10, and 10 was fully ready, what number would you choose?"
"Er, a nine."
Why do you think you picked a number as high as nine instead of a lower number like a six or a seven?
"Well, I really don't want sexually transmitted diseases and I don't like to wonder if I have one or not."
Okay. What plan could you come up with to ensure that you achieve this goal?
"Um, I want to count my drinks so I don't have more than two, and I want to stop drinking as soon as I start feeling drunk."
Who could help you achieve this goal?
"Well, I have this girlfriend who thinks I drink too much, and she would probably be willing to promise me not to drink more than two drinks at a party."
Okay. And how about unprotected sex? It sounds like you don't want to experience it again.
I will talk to him and promise him that we will always use a condom and not have sex.
"So, you are very motivated to change your drinking and you have a plan not to have more than two drinks at parties and not to have unprotected sex. I would like to tell you how it works for you. What do you think about coming back in about six weeks?"
Okay.
Thank you for the interview and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
"So, Chris, I wanted to talk to you. Um, you know, you're one of our star athletes. I really appreciate you as a team player. As athletic director, one of my responsibilities is to keep the players informed and make sure that everyone is doing their best. And, this weekend, something came up to me. I heard about a big party that went down and I understand that you were there, so I wanted to talk to you a little bit about how partying and alcohol fit into your life now."
"Okay, oh, could I confide in you something that has bothered me lately? Well, before this party, as you know, I am an honorary student and my parents keep me out of, like, social life like they keep me very, very out of, like, k-kept me out."
Mm-hmm.
"And about a month ago, my friends invited me to a party and they took advantage of the fact that I always do my homework, I always learn that, to go to the party, and it was at that party that I managed to convince my parents that I would spend the night with my boyfriend."
Mm-hmm.
"It was a unique experience, as you can say. I think you can say it. And, I don't know, I - it was fun, at least at that moment. So I carried on. Last weekend, instead of studying for an exam, I asked my mom - I asked her to let me go to another party. And she, somehow, knew what I was doing. She asked me to promise her no alcohol, no drugs. Then, I'll pick you up by 12: 00. And I - I was surprised. 12: 00-12: 00, that's basically when the party started, but I told her whatever I said - I thought I'll - I'll come - I'll find out, can you pick me up later? So later, so simple - I promised that - she dropped me, I promised her no alcohol, nothing. So - we'll go, I"
"You're an honorary student. You're a star athlete. You've done everything you've been told over the years, and maybe last month you started getting more involved in the party scene."
Correct.
"At first it was fun, but now you can see the consequences."
"Yes, right. I noticed that I was more lethargic and apathetic about schoolwork."
Mm-hmm.
"I don't really - I just like to sit in class - I think about something else, especially at weekends, where instead of studying I was with my friends and trying to figure out where to go - I get alcohol based on their age and stuff like that."
It really changed your focus: What do you like about drinking?
"I don't know. It's because I'm a very reserved person, for the most part, not when I'm dealing with sports or things like that - you know, like a social environment. I tend to stay for myself because I'm very self-conscious, I'd say. And when I drink, I feel, I don't know, I like it. I'm able to talk to other people more easily or engage."
"So it helps you to relax a little bit, to feel more relaxed."
Exactly.
"Sounds like you're noticing some less good things about alcohol, even though your mother got mad at you, you lost concentration, you're kind of not doing so well at school, maybe."
Somehow.
- or other things?
"Just different groups, friends or groups, girlfriends, like different people I hang out with because certain people are associated with this kind of scene."
Mm-hmm.
So that has changed.
"So, your friends you've just been hanging out with, there's a bit of tension now."
"A little bit because not everyone wants that. So I'm in a group of friends, and I'd talk to another person who's a different group of friends, and they just happen to invite me to that first party."
Mm-hmm.
"Since then, I have been hanging out with them more and getting to know them, but I also see that I believe that I am only living life. However, it is not fair to them that I am not there for them as much as I used to."
Okay.
You know how they're there for me.
"Now, considering that you have noticed all these changes where they affect your friendships, it affects your studies, it affects your relationship with your mother. Where should you go from here?"
"Oh, uh, I think I should stop. I mean, I'm not unrealistic. I understand that situations like this are going to happen."
Mm-hmm.
It's just up to me not to get to the point where I can't remember the night before when I puke.
Mm-hmm.
"And I have to slowly regain my trust in my mother, because that was a big blow. It's little, so I think it may seem to other people."
Yes.
But for me it's a big deal.
Your mother is really important to you.
Of course.
And how she thinks of you is important to you.
Exactly.
"How important is it for you to adjust your drinking, er, or even stop?"
"A lot at this point, because I feel that this is a big factor in regaining my trust in my mother."
Okay.
And also to get my athletics back on its feet.
Okay.
So I have a feeling that there is a future in this.
"How confident are you that you could actually change your drinking, or even reduce or stop it?"
I'm pretty confident especially.
"O on a scale of 1 to 10, where one is not 10 at all, is entirely the number you would specify."
Probably like an 8 or 9.
Okay.
"And that can't be a ten, there's nothing I feel as a ten in life, as if there are too many factors, but I feel determined to do it."
Why did you say eight or nine and not six or seven?
"Because I don't know that I am deterred by the determination to make this happen, because I don't like how I felt after cheating on my mother. I don't like to remember that feeling was like vomiting."
Mm-hmm.
"It's not a pleasant experience. Er, it's not something I want to enjoy. So even when I drink, I don't want to drink to the point where that happens, like all the fun I have, and before that it's just not worth it - it's not worth drinking."
"Well, what do you think is a realistic goal for you?"
"To make sure that I have my studies. Well, first try to restore my confidence with mother-"
Mm-hmm.
"- then I just concentrate on my studies. If I then have time for my free time, how to party with my friends and just be with them as a party, it does not mean that I have to drink. And a cup does not do anything to my life. But I would prefer not to do that."
"So your goal is not to drink at all, or if you're at a party, er, at most one."
"Exactly. That's just how I participate in the social convention, but it's not."
"Yes. Chris, I really appreciate you talking to me about it. I know it feels like it to you and, you know, like I said, I'm really interested in you as a student and an athlete and I want what's best for you, so I'm glad we were able to talk about it. It really seems like you have a good plan for the future, you know, you really aspire to not drink alcohol at all, and if you find yourself in a situation where there's alcohol, make sure you have that limit of one drink at a time. It sounds like something that's going to work for you."
And - and thank you very much for listening to me. It means a lot to me.
"It's mine - yes, it's my pleasure. It's part of my job and it's probably like that. I'm going to hurry up and change for training."
"Thank you for coming to me today, Nina. I am looking forward to getting to know you a little bit and hearing about you and what brought you here today."
"Um, my doctor referred me. He said I had to come because I was a bit irresponsible with this pregnancy. Yes."
Okay. He thinks you were a little irresponsible.
"Yes. Er, he said I drink too much with it. Er, I-I wasn't much, but he said it was still maybe, er, would screw things up."
And there is some concern about that.
"Yes. Yes. Just like me - I don't want to screw up with this baby, but, um, yes, I'm right - I'm afraid I've already done it."
"Okay. So you worry about the consequences, and you really care about your baby, and you want to give your baby the best possible start."
Mm-hmm.
And you wonder a little bit what we will spend together during this time.
"Yes. He didn't really tell me what to expect. He just said, ""Go to her too."""
"So here you are today and, erm, you say you've been drinking alcohol throughout your pregnancy."
"Yes. Er, I only found out I was pregnant in the second month."
Okay.
"- and I had been drinking at the time. Um, I really tried not to do that, but, you know, the weekends come and, um, all my friends party somehow and everything, and it was hard to break that habit."
Mm-hmm. So there is this pressure from the outside that comes from the people who are close to your heart to stay in the scene somehow.
"A little bit. I think if I talk to them, it would be fine, but it's strange, isn't it? As if I was the only one of my friends who took that step and had a child, and they don't really know how to handle it."
"In one world you are preparing to become a mother and bring a baby into this world, and in the other world you are having a good time for a while."
Yes.
-Drink and your friends are -
"Yeah, like, I'm still, like, I'm only in my twenties, and - and for everyone else, it's like, ""Okay, it's party time,"" and now I kind of have to break out of that."
"Okay. So, this party world - do you feel that this is something you want to move out of and into this mother world? Or does it feel like I still want to hang out there?"
"There is, yes, there is a part of me that still wants to live it out because I won't have another chance, like once this child comes it's over. I know I gonna- I know I have to change."
"So for you, it feels like things will change once the baby comes and actually lies in your arms, but right now, while you're pregnant, you're thinking, ""I can hang out in both worlds a little bit,"" but part of you might think that's maybe not the case. Maybe it's time to go into the world of the mother."
Yes. Probably. And I also have the feeling that it is too late. I have already screwed it up.
"Okay. So you have a lot of concerns about your alcohol consumption - up to this point. What do you know about, er, drinking alcohol during pregnancy?"
"Well, I know how, they don't say, but I thought, because my friends didn't care, I thought, ""Okay. How maybe - maybe it doesn't matter. Maybe it's just what they tell you."" Just like drinking in general is bad."
"So, because your friends didn't urge you to stop drinking, you thought it had to be OK."
Yes.
And then there's that other part of you that thought maybe it's not right.
"Yeah, like, I probably should have trusted my gut."
So your gut tells you what? Tell me about it.
It tells me that what I am doing is wrong and probably harms my child and that once I actually have my child I will really regret it.
"And you really want to do what's best for your baby, and some kind of question, um, how to get from here, is that what you want to focus on, or what are your thoughts on quitting drinking?"
"Um, I definitely am not - I think I probably could. It's true - it's difficult when you're in that moment, like. You're with your friends and they're drinking and you don't want to be - you don't want to be the mother in that moment. You want to be yourself. You want to be what you were before."
"So, in a way, you have this identity, a dual identity. I want to be that person, and yet that person."
"And so many people disappear when they have children, just from their friends. And I don't want to be that person. I don't want to be the person who has only one child, and they are completely different."
"MM. So embrace this life with the picket fence and the, you know, little house and the baby in it."
"Yes, suburbs. Yes."
"So, you don't want to be that - that's this woman who just kind of lives in this house with the stroller, and at the same time this world says she's behind you."
"Yes, I guess. Like, I don't want to - I don't want to lose my friends because of it. And I don't want to put pressure on them to change, because I mean, they're good people."
They take care of them.
Yes.
"It's just the scene they're in - they're still there because their lives may not have taken the change that made your life. And now, you're here and you're not sure. You want the baby, but you're not sure about the suburbs and the picket fence thing. You're not sure -"
I don't want that.
You don't want that.
No.
They want that baby.
Yes.
"And you want to, erm, take care of your baby as it grows."
"Like, I want to -- I want to be responsible for this thing."
You don't want to let your baby down.
No.
"And at the same time, it's hard to let go of the past, but on the other hand, you think, ""I have no choice. I have to look like this."" Is this how it feels?"
I think so. I feel like I've already made a choice and made some bad decisions.
"Nina, I wonder, what is your hope for the future? When you think about where you are today, um, what do you hope for the future?"
"Well, I-I kept the child because I wanted it - it was almost like this push, this sign for me to move forward and become like an adult because it's scary, right? Like I-I still feel like a teenager sometimes. And to have that push, to be a real person, is really - it's a lot of pressure and I-I want to raise this child well. I don't want - I don't want to let my child down. I don't want it, you know, I don't want to regret having this child because I think it's the right time, but I don't want it - I don't want to make mistakes that make me realize I might not be ready for it, ""because sometimes it feels like I'm not ready for it."
"You put your heart on the baby really being there - it was almost like a sign for you saying, ""This baby is going to give you some kind of new chance in life or give you a plan B,"" and you both have to decide what plan B is going to look like."
"Yes, I think it's easier said than done. It's like, great, I can make all these changes and I can be a whole new person, but it's like at the end of the day, I'm still who I am."
"As that baby grows inside you and you think about all the possibilities that might arise from it, there is a part of you that says, ""I'm still the same girl who drank and partied"" - and maybe not living the life you wanted to live."
"Yes. And I'm right - you know, you can't just flip a switch and become a new person."
"While this baby feels like your second chance, you ask yourself, ""Do I deserve this second chance?"" and then that other part of you says, ""Why not?"
"Yes, I guess that voice gets a little more stifled by the other."
"Mm-hmm. You have a lot of people around you that kind of pull it down, and it's kind of a return to the old life, and the baby is a constant reminder that this new life is ahead of us."
"Yes, it will be very different when it does come."
"If you are thinking about accepting this new life and going down this other path, turning away from path A and going down path B, how confident are you that you can go down path B and bring up this baby successfully and let go of the drinking and life you were in path A?"
I think I have to be successful. I really have no choice. I have to go down this path the way I have to.
"Mm-hmm. Tell me more about it, what makes you say, ""I have to go this way""? What makes you feel that you need it?"
Because I have to do this for my child. It all gets screwed up if I don't.
"This part of you that says, ""I have no way to make this life better,"" asks, ""Do I have the confidence to make this life a reality?"" What do you think you need to do to increase your confidence that you can do this?"
"I don't know if I could actually talk to my friends and please them, or if they would actually be able to see this child and walk. ""Of course, your choice makes sense."" Maybe it would also give them a wake-up call if they actually want to see it."
"So you think that once your friends see you with the baby in their arms, they too will see that there is another way for them, too?"
Or at least they feel less pressure to be what they want me to be.
"Mm, somehow you feel torn between two worlds."
A bit.
"It's not easy to be in this world and also have this constant reminder that the baby is coming and this baby is saying, ""I want this better life,"" and you want to give the baby a better life as well. Who can support you, do you think, when you look around, who is in your circle, who can support you on the way to B?"
"Definitely my parents, uh, and I probably have to go and meet some other people who might have kids, so I can see how it's done, because I only have a younger brother who's not even close. So I really don't have anyone in my life who I know has had kids lately, so I'd love to meet other, you know, young moms out there who, you know, are kind of struggling with the same stuff that I am."
"And your parents are a support for you and support you in giving up drinking, drinking alcohol, that's something they would support."
"I don't think they realise, er, that I do it or how much I do it."
Okay.
"And I know if they found out, they'd be really pissed off."
That would be a concern for them and for you.
Yes.
"Yes. Is that something that you and I could maybe meet again - and talk about having those conversations with the family, maybe have conversations about, you know, the people, your friends who are currently in the lifestyle you were involved in, um, and what it would be like to go down the B road, is that something that you would be open to meeting me again?"
"I do think, yes, like telling my parents and [incomprehensible] my parents, that's probably the scariest thing."
Mm-hmm.
"And to have to talk to these friends, like I do now, I don't want to. It puts them in a strange place."
Somehow it feels like climbing Mount Everest.
Yes.
And you have no equipment.
It feels like I have to give lectures - I don't want to have to give them and I don't want it to be like a lecture.
They worry that they will treat you like a child.
My parents or my friends?
"Oh, oh, you're talking about your friends."
"Yes, Lecture My--Yes."
"You wonder if they will somehow be like children, and you will be like the parents who say,"
"Yes, and I don't want to be like that."
You just want to be like peers talking to each other.
Yes.
And you want them to support you.
"I want to remain friends with them, I don't want them to be fair to each other."
"You don't want to lose your support group, yes. You just want them to help you be healthy while they help you raise the baby, and so we just go the way B. You don't want to lose them, just maybe the lifestyle that it sounds like."
"Yes, as if there were an equilibrium between perhaps not the paths but the worlds, if there was an equilibrium between that."
Mm. You want the best of both worlds somehow.
Yes.
"I want the friends and the relationship I get from my friends, and at the same time I don't want the party scene that comes with it."
"Yes, as I know, I just can't quite cut my friends off."
"Well, Nina, you know yourself best, and you know, you know, you know, you know what your world looks like and like, you know, you know, the support that your friends give you and the support that you get from your family, you know that, and I-I really just want to help you make those decisions and have those conversations, and I want to do everything I can to support you in that. Er, and I just wonder if we can somehow pick that up on a next visit, um, but before we go there, I just wonder, are there some steps you would be willing to take or consider taking in relation to your drinking, anesthesia?"
"Um, yeah, I'm so close anyway that I know I have to do it now. Um, and I just screwed it up, like, is it already too late?"
"You worry about your baby's health. I would just like to share with you, Nina, that every day without alcohol is a good day for your baby, and you know, starting with zero alcohol today is a great start, and I wonder if that's the kind of thing you'd be open to, as you don't drink alcohol anymore at the moment."
"Mm-hmm, I have to do that."
"Okay, that sounds like it's really important to you, you want it to happen."
Yes.
Is there anything I can do to support you before we go so far as to give up alcohol today?
I do not think so. I think it is enough to know that it is not too late to get started.
"Today, they have been given something of a reality check."
A bit.
You have spoken to me today really well and I thank you so much for simply sharing your heart.
"Hello, are you Katie?"
Yes.
"Hello, my name is Beth. I am the nurse who works with the nurse you just saw, Mrs. Smith. Do you have a moment to talk?"
"Er, of course. What is this all about?"
"I know you were here to get a birth control prescription, but while you were waiting for Mrs. Smith, you filled out a questionnaire about healthy habits."
Mm-hmm.
- and you answered some questions about your marijuana use. Would it be okay if I asked you some questions about how marijuana plays a role in your life?
Sure.
"I noticed that you regularly use marijuana, and I wanted to ask you more about it."
"Well, you know, they just decriminalized it in Virginia, that's no big deal. I'm not in trouble, right?"
"No, no, no, not at all. Um, I just wanted to ask you how it helps you and how you use it. Can you tell me a little more about how you use it?"
"It's not a big deal, it's like a couple of times a week to relax."
Is marijuana really useful in your life if it helps you relax?
"Yes. I mean, I'm here on an academic scholarship, so I have to maintain my grades and I'm on the debating team, so there's a lot going on."
"Mm. You are a very successful student and you have a lot of responsibilities, and that really increases your stress."
"Well, the truth is that I'm the first in my family to go to college, so I don't know, I think I'm a bit above my head."
"MM. You were academically very successful, and the transition to college was difficult for you."
I have always been an anxious person. Pot only helps to calm my nerves.
"I promise you, you are not in trouble, I want to help you."
"Er, tell me, what's positive about pot, apart from that it helps you relax?"
"Well, some of these kids are just so much more sophisticated than me, so I think when I party with them, I feel like I'm inserting myself. I don't know how else to explain it."
"Hmm. Er, if you use pot in a group, do you feel more comfortable and accepted with your peers?"
"I don't know if I feel more accepted, more like I'm trying to fit in by using it."
So how does it work to help you fit in?
I'm not sure that's true.
"So smoke with your peers to try to fit in better, but it doesn't seem to make you feel more comfortable with your friends."
"Er, yes."
What are the disadvantages of smoking?
"t know. I - It helps me relax, but I think I'm nervous about getting caught. Er, my parents would kill me if they knew I smoked."
So smoking doesn't help you feel more socially comfortable and increases your stress because you're worried about your family and legal consequences?
Yes.
Can you imagine any other disadvantages of smoking?
"Well, I don't have the money. I usually just give it to my roommate, her parents give her a lot of pocket money, but I don't know, it's kind of embarrassing to have to do that."
So smoking also reminds you of your financial situation and you don't have any extra money to spend on things?
Yes.
"Katie, it sounds like smoking the pot will help you relax a little bit, and it will also cause you a lot of stress because you are trying to use it to fit in, and that does not help, you are afraid of getting caught, you are afraid of disapproval in the family. After all this, do you think what you want to do about your use of the pot?"
"I do not know, but putting it this way, it does not sound like a very good habit."
Would it be okay if I made a suggestion?
Okay.
"You mentioned at the beginning of our conversation that you have a history of dealing with anxiety, have you ever spoken to a counsellor about it?"
"No, we don't do that in my family."
Can you tell me more?
I don't know. It's for crazy people and we definitely don't have the money for it.
"Mm. So the idea of family counseling is just for madmen, and it gets looked down on and the cost would cause a problem?"
Yes. I just don't see it happening.
"Katie, we know that a lot of kids go to college, have a lot of stress and deal with a lot of anxiety, and we've also found that they're much better off talking to our counselors and learning specific skills to deal with anxiety. Um, and it's been really successful for a lot of kids. Um, I wonder if you think it might be helpful for you?"
I don't know.
Can you describe why you hesitate?
"Well, I don't have the money for it, so I can't pay it and my parents wouldn't approve."
"Well, the cost is free, and the consulting services we offer are legally required to protect your privacy. We can't tell your parents. There are some exceptions to this privacy rule, including, er, mostly when it comes to your safety."
"What, how suicidal?"
Exactly.
"Er, I would never do that."
"Well, erm, we can go into some more details if you decide to consult the adviser about what privacy rules are in place, but for the most part you wouldn't have to worry about us sharing something with your parents."
Okay. I think I'll think about it.
"So, erm, if you go out now, I can go out with you and just guide you through our counseling center. I can even introduce you to one of the counselors."
Do I have to go there?
"No. No, no. I just wanted to show you where it is and make sure you know about our resources here at the university."
"Okay, sure. I agree, let's go."
I just feel helpless in the face of this whole deal.
You're hopeless at what's going on.
I just feel helpless in the face of this whole deal.
They don't seem to know what to do next.
Nobody wants to help me.
You get the feeling that people are not ready to help.
Nobody wants to help me.
You feel alone.
Mm-hmm. I really shouldn't have done it.
You realise you shouldn't have done that.
Mm-hmm. I really shouldn't have done it.
They are remorseful.
Mm-hmm. I couldn't help myself.
"Er, it's something that's just happened."
I couldn't help myself.
You're nervous that you've lost control of your behavior.
It's been a fantastic week.
They've had a really good week.
It's been a fantastic week.
They seem to be excited about it.
"Mm-hmm. I know who to hang out with, I'm not stupid."
They definitely know how to make good decisions.
"I know who to hang out with, I'm not stupid."
You know that positive peer influences have been helpful to you.
Mm-hmm. I let the whole family down. They had so much hope in me.
You feel like you've let your family down.
Mm-hmm. I am abandoning my whole family. They had so much hope in me.
You feel like you've been a disappointment to them.
Mm-hmm. That's not what I want for my life.
This is not what you imagined.
That's not what I want for my life.
They are ready to take steps to improve this.
Mm-hmm. I really want to get out of the program.
You don't want to be here.
I really want to get out of the program.
They seem motivated to play by the rules.
"Mm-hmm. I still crave smoking, even though I quit."
It's something that always comes to mind.
"I still crave smoking, even though I quit."
"It takes a lot of, um, strength to still not smoke, even though you still crave it."
Mm-hmm.
"Well, welcome, Ricky."
Thank you very much.
Nice to meet you.
"Yes, you do."
And you thought we were OK?
"Yes, yes, yes, yes."
Fine.
"Yes. Yes, pretty straightforward."
""
-always good.
Have you been here before?
"No, not at all."
"Hm. Okay. Well, erm, I know a little bit why you are here today."
Yes.
"-um, but it's great to see you, so maybe it's a good starting point to tell me why you're here."
"Sure. Er, I guess, you know, maybe two or three weeks ago I had this group of friends who came to me, and uh, you know, they - they kind of said it was like a night to hang out and watch DVDs and stuff, and then they kind of sat me down and said, ""You know, maybe you need a little help for drug stuff."" Then, you know, I was like, ""Well, mm."" And that kind of annoyed me at first, but I - I suppose, you know, I thought about it a little bit and then I was like, ""Well, I guess it can't hurt to talk to someone about it, maybe."""
Correct.
Yes.
And that is what led you to be here today?
Yes.
Fine.
"Yes. I just searched a bit on the internet and just read about this place, so I just thought, I will -"
"Right. So it sounds like you think there is something you have to look at, something that affects you?"
"Yes, I guess. I - I guess I hadn't really thought about it until they sat me down, and you know - I mean, I could, erm, I could understand a little bit where they came from, so yes, I thought I would -"
Worried about you?
Yes.
Fine.
"Yes. Yes, that was probably a bit of a shock."
You were surprised?
"Yes. Yes, ""because I don't know. You know, you see it in the movie when people kind of intervene or say,"" You know, you have to go and get help. ""And then - I don't know. As you know these characters and they - they need help, you know -"
Yes.
- because they are fucked.
Mm-hmm.
"And you kind of go, ""Woah. That's not me."" So it's about being me -"
You are not sure if this applies to you?
"Yes, or well, not to that extent, you know what I mean? Like, I-I didn't think I'd come anywhere near the point where I'd have to sit down and intervene."
Okay.
- if you know what I mean.
Fine.
I suspect.
"I try to understand you as much as possible, something concerns you and something concerns your friends."
Yes.
- but you don't know if it's - if it's - how bad it is or not - and you just want to try it out?
"Yes, yes, yes, ""because I mean, you know, they're my friends and -"
Mm-hmm.
"- You know, I'm not going to be so narrow-minded to say for sure that, you know, they're completely wrong because there's a big group of them, you know? And they care, so obviously, that there's something that I might have overlooked. But, on the other hand, I'm kind of like, ""Well, was it that bad?"" and you know, ""Was that really necessary?"" But I, you know, I thought I'd give them the benefit of the doubt and -"
Yes.
"- and just check it, yep."
"Because they care about you - and you respect what they say, and you wonder if there is anything right in what they say, but let's check that a little bit?"
"Yes, pretty much right."
Fine.
Yes.
"Well, let's do a few checks."
"Okay, cool."
"So tell me a little bit about what you are doing, what it is - what is the worry they are causing."
"Um, drugs, I guess."
Mm-hmm.
"Mm, yes. You can do a little P now and then."
Fine.
"- and, um, I guess, less often, I smoke a little bit, you know, I smoke a little bit and, um, I smoke party pills in it - sometimes at weekends."
Okay.
Yes.
"Tell me a bit about what it means now and then, and - and - how often."
"Er, maybe a couple of times a week."
"Is that it - is that with, er, the drug?"
"Yes, yes."
That's meth you're talking about? A few times a week?
"Mm-hmm, yes. Yes. So, if I put it that way, it sounds a lot, but it doesn't feel much, you know? If you know what I mean?"
"Well, maybe we can check that to see if it's a lot or not, but maybe it's also important to discuss with you what the effects are and what your concerns are about it, but help me understand a bit more about how it is for you. Tell me - tell me what's wrong with your, er, use of meth that you're using - that you liked it, that you thought it was good for you?"
"Right. Um, I suppose it's a kind of hand-in-hand game where I just hang out with some new scene I like - um, I moved to Auckland maybe three years ago."
Mm-hmm.
"And, erm, I still live in Palmy and, as you can imagine, it's a bit different down there. And, erm, when I first came here, I was introduced a bit to the Family Bar on [incomprehensible 00: 06: 49]."
"I know Family Bar, yes."
"Yeah. It's that kind of - that sorta scene, that kind of, um, gay scene, I think. And, like, it's not something I really thought about before--But then they kind of hung out there and just met these people who were kind of like, you know, like you don't really get a lot of palmy. Well, I mean, you do, but they're not -- you know, in those kind of bars in Auckland you can do justice -- Er, you can just be out there, you know, and I guess it's not that easy in Palmy. Um, just to arrive and see that and meet these people who were just really friendly, you know, and -- and not judge me on it. I know, Palmy is often something like, ""Oh, you"
"It's a pretty heavy party scene most weekends and stuff. So it kind of goes hand in hand with that really, and just, you know, I guess if I have a little bit of time - I don't know, you just feel really good, I think. Just feel like happy and excited, and just being surrounded by people that, you know, really care and love you and - coming from a place where you didn't have it - you don't understand so much, it's just cool, you know, to be able to go. ""Okay, that day I can take that."" And it's just that moment like ""I know - I know I feel good."" I think that's part of it."
"Auckland, coming to Auckland from Palmerston for you was like taking on something that you would keep an eye on to do something different in your life?"
"Yes, in a way. Although I didn't really realize it. I just discovered it here. It's not like I came to Auckland to look for that kind of culture."
Correct.
"-Lift to get away from, er, you know mainly parents, and this kind of lifestyle, this palmy kind of lifestyle. But then I discovered this other thing, er -"
What did you not realise at Palmerston?
No.
Okay.
"No. I didn't really know. I think you see things like that in movies from America that you know, but you don't really know."
Mm-hmm.
"- Think that they would exist in your own country. Well, not if you grew up in Palmy."
Palmerston. Mm-hmm.
"Um, I don't want to be mean to Palmy, but, you know, it's just the other kind of attitude, I think, somehow - it's not like that."
Yes.
- something like that.
It sounds as if you are prepared to go for something that was different.
Yes.
And - and you came.
""
-here to Auckland.
"Yeah, yeah. I really wanted to get away from anything. I didn't know what, but then I came here and found this thing that was so obviously destiny or whatever that drew me to this thing."
Fine.
"- ""Causa"" because I found something in myself or something that was missing."
And how does that feel to you now?
"Um, now I think I'm just a little used to it. [clears his throat] When I first came here, I thought, ""Wow, that's amazing."" That's hard, I guess, but you know, it's been three years now, so it's kind of like I've gotten used to it."
Mm-hmm.
"I mean, I guess it's me, let's say, I take it for granted, but, um, yeah, it's just convenient now. And, um, it's just kind of what I'm really doing. Yeah, so I guess the drugs are related to it. It's - well, it's just part of it, I don't really think - I didn't really differentiate it. It's just kind of ""Okay, I'm going to hang out with my friends,"" and that sort of thing, you know, this Saturday, Friday night, and then it just really happens as part of it."
"So coming out, feeling like I'm gay."
Yes.
Being part of a gay culture here in Auckland feels good.
Yes.
- for you?
Yes.
And at the same time - for you this is closely connected with the drug scene - with the meth scene?
Yes.
And you do not experience where these two things are separate from each other? You just seem to be together more often than not?
"Well, I guess now that I'm thinking about it, maybe it's gone beyond that, maybe I didn't notice."
""
"I mean, as always - well, that's it, you know, it's kind of a thing that happens on weekends, but, I think, sometimes on weekdays. You know, I'm going to have - I'm going to have a big night pretty much every weekend, um, maybe two, but sometimes, you know, on weekdays like a Tuesday or Wednesday or something, if I just feel like doing something, then maybe I do that sometimes to see if someone else wants to come and join me or, you know, occasionally I smoke alone maybe or something like that, and I guess that's not entirely related to that scene, I guess."
"It just sounds like something is worrying you, that there is a partial link, but there is no connection between that and that - that drugs may become a more important part of your life."
Mm. Maybe. I guess I hadn't really thought about it.
Okay.
-until recently.
So has anything changed lately?
"Yes. I suppose just since that kind of intervention, or I started to give them the benefit of the doubt."
Yes.
"- maybe I notice some things I hadn't noticed, but -"
Tell me about the things you notice that you didn't notice before.
"Oh, I mean, just now, you know, when you asked me how many times."
Did you find that surprising?
"Mm. S. has surprised me to think about it, you know, if there's something, and you don't really think about it, but if someone asks you, you know how often or - and then you have to sort of quantify it, I suppose it sounds kind of shocking, you know, when I imagine saying something like, ""I do this, you know, a couple of times a week."""
""
"It sounds shocking, but to me it doesn't feel like that, you know, that's the way it is, where it kind of doesn't sit right. I [clears my throat] so I've been berating my friends a little bit, or I don't know where it is, a little defensive. ""Because it sounds a lot, but it doesn't feel out of control or anything, you know. It doesn't feel like, I don't know, people who have to go to therapists or whatever you're going,"" Oh, they're addicted. ""You know. So - their health is really bad and they need urgent help straight away, um, well, at least that's a little bit of the feeling you get. And I don't feel like it's a really urgent thing at all."
Fine.
-felt a bit strange.
Okay.
Yes.
"So you worry a little bit and you'll find out more, but you won't accept this idea of having a headache or anything -"
Yes.
Okay.
Absolutely.
"So tell me, er, Ricky, what - what's the other side of the good things that the consumption of meth or some smoking means to you? Is there a downside? Are there any problems you're experiencing?"
"Yep. Er. Er, I guess money is a pretty big deal. Like, I had a lot more money sorta last year. I had a pretty good job, like a pretty regular acting job."
Mm-hmm.
"Um, and it was like a whole lot of money last year. So it wasn't such a problem then. And I guess I kind of blew the money a little bit. Um, so I don't have that much actor income now, and I work in a cafe like some kind of part-time, and it doesn't bring in that much. So it's kind of like that now, and sometimes I have to borrow a little bit of money or sometimes I need a little help with the rent."
"In the last year, a lot has changed from -"
Yes. Yes. A bit.
It doesn't sound like it was part of the plan.
"But, you know, that's an actor's life, I think ups and downs work and don't work."
Sure. [giggling] It's not a safe profession.
No.
- and it is hard -
But it isn't.
"But is there, I wonder, any connection at all between acting and the use of meth in terms of the impact of using meth on yourself - on your ability to get a job?"
"Hmm. Could have been a couple of auditions that I didn't do so well, and how I could have been the cause of it."
Maybe the drug had an effect on it?
"Er, maybe. Maybe it's just my general kind of state. Er, I don't know, sometimes I assume that just something like ""What am I doing or why am I spending my money on it?"" weighs on my mind."
Hmm.
"You know, I am - you go in - you go to places, interesting places, but you know, I might as well have saved the money and actually gone to interesting places, I guess. But I don't know. I wonder if it - if it has an effect. I-I don't know. I can't say for sure, but maybe it's not so good for the face, I don't know."
Fine.
"- or whether I am actually tired or run down, I guess. I didn't really think about that either."
Fine.
- but now I start to think about it.
Correct. And they also got questions.
Yes.
- to be asked are they -
Yes.
You start to think about these things and what impact they can have on you.
Yes.
And the choices you could have about it.
Hmm.
"What else? You know, are the decisions you make around money, and the use of meth has gobbled up a significant amount of the money?"
Yes.
- the last year and perhaps the impact on work and skills - maybe you are not listening as well as you might.
Yes.
"And maybe the effects around, even on your physical appearance. An interesting question around the effects of meth consumption on your physical appearance."
Mm-hmm.
"Um, what - are there any other problems? Any other things that are a bit detrimental to it?"
"Er, I guess it obviously has some effect on my friends and roommates because they've sat me down and said, ""Look, you gotta go."
Yes.
"Look, otherwise we can't hang out anymore. '"
And that's a problem?
"That would be a problem, yes."
Why?
"If they didn't want to hang out, well, what did I have, I suppose?"
They are important.
"Yes. Yes, and I mean part of it, yes. Part of it is that I'm wondering, ""cause, you know, a lot of those friends that settled me down are obviously the ones that are not part of that scene. I mean, there were a few that are, but mostly they were the ones that were kind of always a bit judgmental. You know, when I started doing all that stuff, you know. And of course, there was no problem either -"" because I used to be that guy, too, you know, like, ""No, never do that,"" because it's bad, ""and then you try it the first time and you go,"" Actually, it's not that bad. ""It's not the end of the world, if you're reasonable with it, it's not going to be, you know."
"You have to take a stupid amount to do something like that, or, you know, to die or end up in a hospital."
Yhmm.
"Then it's just a bit of fun, but you can't really explain it to the people that are there, so it's hard not to sit in this room full of people and say, ""Oh, you know, you really should stop the drugs, they're bad."" It's like, ""Well, you don't really know what you're talking about."""
"Hmm. But Ricky, let me just check, ""because I got it wrong, just check with you that there are some friends you have and they still care about you. Did I get that right with what you said earlier - that those who care about you and were part of this intervention are using some of them."
"Yes, a couple."
And you - so they have their concerns and - and you are also starting to ask questions about this use and -
Yes.
"- it is just that we will try to go into ourselves a little bit more, just to pick up for you what you think is going on and what you think some of the options might be for you."
Yes.
And we're going to -- we're going to put all this stuff aside because I hear from you that's not what this is about.
Yes.
"What do you think will happen, what could happen if you can change your use - it's your turn now? What - what are your concerns about not making any changes?"
"Er, I suppose acting is a really big worry."
Fine.
"'Because I want it to be my job, you know, I've had enough of coffee shops."
That's going to be your career.
Yes.
-You want to make.
"I wish it were, yes."
"Mm-hmm. When you're trying to shape your career, it's harder to get it going. You have to be at the top, at the top."
Yes.
Yes.
"Yes, ""because I mean, it's all you know, it's partly and partially missing in the right place at the right time. And if you're in the right place at the right time and it's not at stake, then it would have a -"
"Yes, and perhaps the use of meth compromises that."
"Yes, it could be."
Hmm.
"Yes, and then I think there's money involved as well, you know, I don't do as many courses and as many things as I used to because, you know, it doesn't have the money."
"Okay, so it's back to the money."
"Well, I mean, obviously I don't want to keep peeing at my housemates."
"Yes, yes."
"You know, and it's not - it's obviously not cool not to pay the rent, I'm not happy with that."
That creates problems?
Yes.
Yes.
"Yes, and I don't want to be that person."
"Let's go back to another thing, er, that we talked about a little bit earlier, and it's also about your meth use and - and - and with your gay friends, with your gay lifestyle. And - and that sounds like you're saying that - that when you're partying, when you're with friends, when you're going to the clubs, that meth use is always there?"
Yes.
The availability is there.
Yes.
"And all, most people."
"Yes. Not necessarily P or whatever, but yes, most people do something. Yes. I suppose, yes, it's part of that scene that there's no huge like, you know, you go to normal bars and most people are just drunk and wasted and like to spit everywhere and stuff, whereas that's a different scene. People drink but they don't drink too much, but they take other things and have a good time. And, yes."
And it might be difficult to be part of that scene and not use drugs?
"Yes. I mean, there are people who do that. I suppose it would be difficult. I-I didn't really think about it, I think. That's all it is, all I knew about that scene, you know, ""cause I'm pretty new to it, you know."
Correct.
- so she was always there from the beginning.
So there is a possibility that there are other parts of the scene that are not dependent on drug use.
Yes.
- or especially on-on-meth consumption?
"I can't imagine that everyone is there, I guess only the majority, or at least the majority of people I know, yes."
"So that might be something we can look at, but later, if you care, maybe that's what some of the other parts of the gay scene are whose partying and party medley is still going on, but if meth isn't a dominant drug."
Yes.
"factor in this party, and we - where - where are there, er, er, gay groups that support people who don't want to - they have a lifestyle that is heavily focused on drug use, so there are some ways to look at some other ideas if you're interested, and we could look at that to make you think about it."
Yes.
"- so it's not about giving up anything, it's not about big changes, it's about how I can improve the situation."
"Yes, yes."
That's what I hear when you say you have a little bit more control over what's going on for me.
Yes.
So that I can pursue this plan.
Mm-hmm.
What could be a first step in this direction?
"Well, [coughs] I have to say I was a bit, er, you know, at the beginning when I said, you know, I do that so often, and then I found myself talking about the kind of weekday stuff that I had taken back a little bit of myself. I suppose you know, on a Wednesday alone, as if it didn't sound so good."
"So you have to think about that, right?"
Yes.
Anyway.
Yes.
-what would work for you -
""
- as an alternative.
"Yes. Yes, but I think you're right, just something to look forward to, because it's that midweek break-in, you know. So far away until people are in their place where they can."
Yes.
-Hang out and have a good time.
Yes. Yes. And there are things that have to work for you.
Yes.
"- these are your ideas that are really important, but here too there are some options that you want to look at, you know, just to know what they are."
Yes.
"Because there are clubs and groups, and there are all sorts of things that meet all week."
Yes.
"And although they won't necessarily be like the party scene, they are other activities. Now I'm talking about gay groups and gay activities, which are an option that allows you to"
Yes.
"- You know, knowing well about and - and maybe in- within those options or something you could say, ""Oh yes, I'd try that. Look at it."""
"Yes, yes."
"He, er, introduced me to it, too, so I tried it."
"So, with his encouragement, you tried a few drugs."
Oxy.
Have you tried Oxy? Okay.
Yes.
Okay. And he encouraged you to do so.
"Well, he said it was a painkiller."
He said it would help you with some of the pain you have had.
Mm-hmm.
Yes.
"And it has, but I don't do it so often, only sometimes."
"Okay. So you trusted him, and you tried it out, and you find out that it helped you in a way. What, some of the things you said - take some of the pain, it's not fair - you know."
Dealing with the loss of my grandma.
"Okay, that helped you."
"Yes. I feel alone, and I just miss her, and it does - it helps, but, -"
Mm-hmm. So it helps -
'I don't want to have to put up with that.
"Okay. So it's not something you want to rely on, you don't see that you're going to continue to use it. It's something that you felt was very helpful, at least for the moment?"
"Mm-hmm. Yes, and -"
But isn't it something you want to get into the habit of becoming addicted to?
Correct.
"Yeah, okay. Um, and - and there's a lot going on for you right now? Yes."
Yes it is.
You have managed your business in the best possible way and also have some doubts about what it sounds like?
"Yeah, well, I don't really know much about it except it makes me feel good."
"Okay, so at the moment you know it makes you feel good."
"So Tom, this infection is quite painful for you, but we have antibiotics. If you take them faithfully for 10 days, I am sure that your infection will have disappeared."
Absolutely.
And do you mind if we are talking about a screening form you filled out today on drug use?
Okay.
"Let's take a look: It is written that you occasionally take drugs, erm, except for medical reasons. What drugs do you take?"
I do a bit of meth.
"Snorting, smoking?"
"Snort, always snort."
Don't inject it?
Mm-mm.
Taking other drugs?
"You know, just a little bit of alcohol."
"And, uh, uh, how often do you do that?"
Meth?
Mm-hmm.
"Um, two or three times a month."
So you're an occasional meth user and don't use it very often?
Correct.
Just snorting?
Correct.
"Well, I think, you know, the use of methamphetamine comes with some health risks, and the amount that you use puts you in a category that we consider risky users, and that's in contrast to someone who is said to be addicted, er, someone who is a heavy user, but not in a healthy category, because people who take methamphetamine tend to draw a number of consequences, and actually one of them is, er, sexually transmitted diseases. Do you think that your venereal disease could be associated with your use of methamphetamine?"
"Yes, it could be because, er, I was high when I had unprotected sex, and I wouldn't do that if I wasn't high."
So are you usually very careful and protective when you have sex?
"Absolutely, yes."
And it seems to you that methamphetamine may have clouded your judgment?
Yes.
What else is happening with methamphetamine in your life? Does it affect you in any way?
"No, I mean, no. I mean, like I said, I only do it in clubs, you know, with my friends, erm, at most two or three times a month. Um, erm, I don't think it really has any other effects, but I'm worried about it. I never expected to get gonorrhea."
"Yes, you know, I am also worried, and I would even recommend that you give up methamphetamine altogether, and, erm, there are a lot of reasons for that, but that is my recommendation."
"I understand, but I think that would be a difficult thing for me. You know, I mean, I know I should do it, but I mean, it's like my entire social life. You know, I mean, all my friends go to these clubs. That's where I see them. You know, that's my sex life basically and, erm, meth is just - it's just part of it. You know, I mean, everybody does it there. You know, it's been a while since I wanted to stop doing it - it's kind of hard to think about doing it right away."
"So you realise that methamphetamine has some related problems, and you also see that much of your social life and sex life is linked to methamphetamine, so it would be difficult to stop using it?"
"Yes, I don't think it would be easy, but I'm not saying I'm not ready to try."
"Well, if you were, um, thinking about how far you'd be willing to completely refrain from methamphetamine,"
Mm-hmm.
-where the zero is not finished yet -
""
"-And when 10 are ready, where would you stand?"
"Er, three."
Why not one or two?
"I mean, that was really uncomfortable, you know, gonorrhoea is a really bad experience, and, uh, I know, I don't think the same thing, you know, when I'm on it. And, uh, I mean, what I have is bad enough, I could easily get AIDS. I could get HIV the same way, so that scares me a lot, so it's higher than one or two."
Are there any other concerns you have about methamphetamine?
"t know what it is cut with, you know, there could be something, you know. It could be really bad, er, if it was cut with something dangerous or something. I mean, I-I worry about it sometimes."
"Mm, when I first spoke to you, I thought you would have a very, er, really little interest in not stopping using methamphetamine, but it sounds like you have a number of reasons why you really want to stop using methamphetamine, and that means, er, that it could be cut off with something else, er, you could get another sexually transmitted disease, including HIV."
Yes.
"Er, what do you think would make it easier for you to break down methamphetamine or quit?"
"You know, at weekends, there's something else to do, a different social life."
How can you lead a different social life?
"It's the hardest thing, I mean, almost everyone I know uses it."
Is there anyone in your life who doesn't take methamphetamine?
My sister.
Did you talk to her about your meth use?
"I think she knows I do it sometimes. I mean, we're pretty close. I think I could talk to her about it, and I think she would probably help."
"So, on the one hand, it would be difficult to stop using methamphetamine because there are so many positive effects that you get from using methamphetamine, but, on the other hand, there are reasons why you want to stop using methamphetamine."
Yes.
"And there are a few things you can do to make it easier to give up methamphetamine, including talking to your sister and getting support."
Yes.
"I recommend that you do not take methamphetamine at all, but what you do is up to you."
Okay.
I could see you in a month. Would it work for you?
"Yes, for sure."
Pretty good. It's been three months now.
Beautiful.
"Um, and -"
"Since the last time you used meth, right?"
Correct.
Okay.
Right. It's been three months and I'm feeling pretty good.
Fine.
"Um, and I met some new friends."
Beautiful.
""
"So-so, er, have--the last time we talked, you were something like the ex-boyfriend. This is because he was your dealer, so--"
Correct.
And how does it work for you?
Correct. It was good. I didn't answer the phone when he was called.
Okay.
"- and some of my other friends tried to call me, and I didn't answer the phone. Um, so it was good for me to just get up and meet some new people, um, in the neighborhood where I live."
"So it sounds like you've made some good changes: the change in your surroundings and some of your behaviors, and, er, and those new friends."
"Yes, the new friends, and I use the breathing exercises you taught me when I start to feel a little stressed, and that's me - I use them and it helps me. I go for a walk and do my breathing exercises, and it calms me down and somehow gets me through this time."
That's how it sounds.
"All right, Catherine, welcome back. I'll be interested in it somehow, after we last met, what-what were you - what were you thinking about during the week, because I-I remembered the last time I asked you what you were thinking about coming, but"
""
- what was different this time and your thoughts about coming?
I suppose my expectations are a little clearer as to why I'm here.
Yes.
"I guess it's me - it's made me think about how much money I've lost lately. So, yeah. I'm happier to be here. [giggles]"
"Okay, okay. So there's a shift from last time?"
Mm-hmm.
"Yes. My feeling is that we're going to be able to work together pretty well. That's my kind of feeling, uh - after the last time I thought, you know, ""Here's a young woman who, you know, has some energy to bring things together."
""
"- and, er - ""So, really, what we want to talk about today is to get a sense of, um -- Let's talk about the things we could work well with, um, in the next nine months, you know, really."
Mm-hmm.
"One of the things we dealt with last time was the issue of gambling and, er, last time you talked about how gambling had got you into trouble with your family."
Mm-hmm.
"Yeah. So when I think about it, like, you know, last time, you - you started saying that, well, you think it was - you deserved it and it was thought about, so I kind of wonder how open you are to exploring this from different angles?"
"Yes. I am happy to explore it, so to speak. [giggles]"
"Yes, yes."
Yes.
"Yes, yes."
Yes.
"Yes, so, how-how-do-you-know-how-sometimes, when we start opening things up, and then you think, ""Oh, it feels a bit uncomfortable."" So how do you proceed when you feel uncomfortable? How have you handled things in the past?"
"Hmm. I don't know, I'll probably finish a little bit. [giggles]"
"Yes. Yes. So how would I know if we were talking and you were blocking each other off? What would I notice in our joint meeting, eh?"
"Yeah, um. I'm sure you've noticed. [chuckles] Um, I don't know, it probably fidgets."
Yes?
That's why I'm still a bit -
"Yes, that's okay."
[giggles]
"So, what would be really helpful, maybe because I could miss it, you know, so, like, could you tell me? It would be really helpful if -"
When I feel uncomfortable?
"Yes, yes. If you could just say, ""Ken, hello, I'm starting to vote on this and I'm starting to feel uncomfortable,"" that would be really helpful."
Okay.
Yes?
Mm-hmm.
"Yes, thank you for that, okay. So let's think about it - it has to do with how you just solved the gambling issue because the last time you were here you told me you were going to get a stir, you know, it seemed like you were gambling a little bit more than your girlfriends were aware of, and - and you said you owed one of your girlfriends some money."
""
"Er, how serious do you think this problem needs to be solved?"
[sighs] I suppose it's really serious if I want to get out of my debt.
"Yeah, okay."
"Credit is coming out of my ears and mum and dad are not saving me any more, so"
Yes.
-I guess I have to sort it out myself.
"Okay. So again, on a scale of 1 to 100, how serious - how important is it to clarify that? Yes."
About 80. [giggles]
"About 80? Right up there, yes, yes? And another question that has something to do with it: How confident are you that you will be able to get it right and get on with life?"
I'll say I'm absolutely confident.
Yes? But what if
Yes.
-Your level is on a scale of 1 to 100? Where is your confidence?
What if I dare to stop? [giggles]
"Not necessarily to stop, but we do not know if stopping here is the right answer, I do not know, but your confidence to solve the problem."
"It's difficult when it's part of your lifestyle, you know?"
""
When I went to the pub with my girlfriends last night and had a bit of a flutter
Hmm.
"- So, you know, I think it's a bit strange sitting alone at the bar. [giggles]"
"Yes. Yes, so, you flirted with them last night?"
Yes.
"Yes. Okay, okay. And - and when they stopped fluttering, did you still flutter or did you stop with them? Where-where were you with -"
"Oh, I had to stop halfway because I ran out of money. [chuckles]"
"Okay. Okay. Okay. Yes, yes. So, you said before, you know, there was money, you know, that you couldn't really afford."
Mm-hmm.
"- ""Because you owe some money to your mother and father and they didn't bail you out anymore and you had to go out to find some money, I think?"
Yes.
"Yes? Yes. Yes. So it almost seems like you're still behaving, you know, and still creating a few problems?"
Mm-hmm.
Yes? Yes.
Yes.
There are a few feelings when you think about it?
"t know, but I would like to get back on track, but -"
Yes.
I don't really plan to spend my life in debt. [giggles]
""
"I don't mind traveling, and you know, I have friends who save for that [incomprehensible 00: 18: 27], and I'm 25 and I work in retail and have four credit cards."
Yes.
- so I will not travel any more soon.
"Okay. That too sounds very important somehow. So, what is your dream? What are your dreams? Where do you want to be in five years? Where does Catherine want to be? What do you want to do? What are your dreams?"
Maybe I would like to have traveled and found the man of my dreams. [chuckles]
"Yes, yes."
"I do not know. Children maybe, but"
Okay.
"- I'm not gonna- [sighs] I'm not going to make a decent mother like I am at the moment, right? So I'll probably have to bounce back at some point. [laughs] I'm going to push 30 and still be in debt, at this rate."
"Okay, okay. So it seems that you are in a state in your life where you are thinking about your next steps."
Yes.
"Yes? Yes. ""I'll carry on with my little, current lifestyle,"" and you're so much the party girl you used to be - I spoke to the last time."
[giggles]
"- wasn't that - is that true? Yes? So: ""Do I live a party lifestyle, a kind of party girl lifestyle, or do I have a few other dreams that I can follow?"" So these are difficult calls. And - and all that - and there are no three options. At some point we will have to make these calls."
""
"And, I mean, is that a challenge for you at the moment? Yes?"
Yes.
"When you're five years ahead of you, what position do you want to be in? Which one feels best? Party girl still, you know, with those four credit cards that are mostly exhausted, or do you actually want to think, you know, about having traveled and maybe starting a family, those other things? Which direction feels best for you at that point?"
"Party girl at 30 is a bit sad, isn't she? [giggles]"
I don't know.
"I don't know, so far it's been fun."
What is your hunch? Yes.
"- but I really want to travel, so."
"Yes, yes. Where in particular? You have any idea what -"
"Um, Egypt has always been, yes."
Egypt?
Yes.
"Er, what's that with Egypt, eh?"
"Oh, I just find it fascinating."
Yes?
"Yes. Only that, er, the prospects and the culture and the history and the"
Oh.
- Somewhere I always wanted to go.
Yes.
"It's not the safest place right now, mind you, but [giggles]."
"No, that's true."
Yes.
But for obvious times.
Yes.
It could be very different.
Mm-hmm.
"Yes. Okay, so it's you - how long have you been doing this - this idea, this is what you would like to have and where would you like to go?"
"Oh, since I was young, early teens."
"Oh, yes?"
Yes.
"Mm. How much does the kind of, er, current lifestyle rob you of, you know, that dream?"
"Yes, well, I suppose with the money I've spent in the last five years, I probably could have gone to Egypt and back five times already. [giggles]"
"Yes, yes."
""
"So there are some decisions to make, er, which dream, which path to follow."
""
"Hmm. What is the most difficult thing for you to walk this path, to travel and to realize the dream? What are the hard things to deal with?"
"I think I'll break off some of my friendships. Um, because you see that it's part of their lifestyle, you know."
Yes.
"Yes, it will be a big change."
"Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. So I see that - it's something you've been thinking about for a while. How far do you think you're from that change? You know, ""because obviously it can never be, but how far are you from making decisions about it?"
"Seems a bit like an unrealistic dream. Um, and I'd like to take the first step, but uh, that's going to be easy."
"No, no. It will be easy, so what is the first step for you?"
"Probably, er, [giggles], cutting open the credit cards for a beginner and trying to rein me in and not be tempted, I suppose."
Okay.
"You know, when the Pokies are in the pubs, just don't go to the pub. [giggles]"
"Yes, it's hard, isn't it? It's hard to be in the pub, in that environment."
Mm-hmm.
"I think we would have an illustration for them. We call these high-risk situations. You know, that's it - so you might learn something about the way we describe them."
Mm. [giggles]
"-it and stuff, but you know, being in the pub, you know, you kind of want to get the enthusiasm for, you know, gambling, you know, horror situation, really just going against what you want to do. Yes?"
""
Yes? So how did you find a few ways to deal with that today?
"Um, I haven't made it to this point, so [giggles] I don't know."
""
"Er, I suppose I just have to get tougher with myself."
"Yes. I think being a bit hard on yourself, whatever - yes, people often say that, but, you know, it's not - I think there are some things you can do, and you've already identified a really good strategy."
What? Cutting off some of my friendships?
"Well, there are a few ideas. O-one, think about who your friends are and your friends will help you to realize your dream of a trip to Egypt."
""
"Um, and the other idea you talked about before was actually to cut up your credit cards, so it's kind of amazing what this thing does on different cards, isn't it?"
Mm-hmm.
"It's very helpful and healthy. So, yeah, you've got some really good ideas already, right?"
Mm-hmm.
Yes. So this is some work that we can continue to work with. Yes? Yes?
Yes.
"So ""cause,"" because the question I asked before is what could be the most difficult, and you realized that your friends, you know, could be one of the habits."
""
"Yes, yes. Could this mean that some of your friends are likely to move like you and wonder where they are going?"
Mm-hmm.
"- what they want to promote their dreams, yes?"
Mm.
"Okay, so we talked about where you're going to be in five years and which way you're going to go, yep, yep? And that seemed very clear to you."
Mm-hmm.
"Yes, yes. Something we can do in the near future is to really get some very concrete things in place to help you do that."
Yes.
Yes. So what is one thing you can do until the next meeting?
Find the scissors. [laughs]
"Yes, find the scissors."
Cut the girls out.
"Yes, yes, yes."
"Then, erm, I don't know if the debt will still be there or not, but I - I need to find out -"
Yes.
"-a way to pay them out, and"
Really.
'I don't know how to do that.
"Yes. Okay, so it sounds like a certain budget for buying things will be helpful."
Mm-hmm.
"Yes, and of the things we often bring people here into contact with is a kind of budgetary advice, it's a great service here, um, and something that can be achieved."
""
So let's talk about how we can organise a meeting with them.
"Mm-hmm, that'll be good."
Okay.
Yes.
What else brought you here?
They found a small bag of weeds.
Mm-hmm.
But that's not much.
Mm-hmm.
It's not like I'm selling it or anything.
Just enough for your own use?
"Yeah, whatever, you know, it's California, nobody cares."
Yes. Yes. Yes.
How long will it take?
"Yes, we - you know, we have about 15 to 20 minutes to talk about today. Um, this is certainly just the first of a few sessions that we will have together over the next six months. It would be a natural question that you would of course like to know how much time that will take. Um, what else would you like to know from me about you and your perspective that you think will help me work with you in that time?"
I just want to get everything I need to get ready.
Okay. You're more focused on what you need to do to put that behind you?
""
"Well, I wonder if it's okay with you and - and I have a form that we can use if you want, um, just to put a few different ideas on an agenda that we could share as we work together so that I-I can help you get those behind you. Would that feel like a natural time to find out where we could work together?"
"So you have this dream of having a partner, a house and a nice car."
Yes.
"- so don't forget the beautiful car and some children, and be a good father -"
"Yes, yes."
- to your children. So is this dream beginning -- I can see it for myself?
"Yes, it would be good."
"Yes. Okay. So what really interests me is how offensive this image, this dream is."
I don't think so.
"How does that not fit together, Billy?"
"Er, I think I have to keep coming back here and going to court and stuff."
Yes?
Yes. It kind of confuses things.
"Yes. It kind of screws up this dream, this image?"
"Yes, that makes it harder."
"Mm. Does it make it harder? Yes. Well, it can make it harder to keep a job, right?"
""
""
"Just as it's hard to get a job because you have to say you've spent time and stuff in prison, so it's pretty hard."
Yes.
Yes.
"And we talked about the idea that you get a job and have something to do with cars, because that's your passion."
""
"Yes? So, since we last met, erm, what have you been thinking about what you could do to get that kind of job?"
"Er, I don't know if I would go to Polytech, take courses there or something."
Mm-hmm.
"Yes. Like, if they have jobs now."
"Okay, so you know some people?"
Yes.
"In a way, they went down that path of going back to school and doing a taster course."
"Yes, yes."
-acquire a qualification?
Yes.
Yes? So what - what would you be interested in going down the same path?
Learn more about cars and practical work.
"Mm-hmm. Yes, what exactly? How about if, in view of this kind of work, you could have everything you wanted, what you would do?"
"[sighs] mechanic, or panel [incomprehensible 00: 18: 02], or just -- I wouldn't care, I'm right -- as long as it's cars."
"Mm-hmm. So as long as it has to do with cars, would you flirt with it?"
"Yeah, pretty much."
Yes?
Yes.
Okay. So what do you think you have to do to go down this path to get this qualification?
"I just need to do this training, I guess, and then probably get a job."
Mm-hmm.
Yes.
"Okay. So, what kind of training did you do - did these people you talked about, what did they do?"
"Like, erm, just at Polytech. I don't know what that was exactly, but -"
Mm-hmm.
"It took a year or so, and then they went into apprenticeship."
Mm-hmm.
Yes.
Yes. So how confident are you that you can do something like this - these friends you have?
Yes. I could make it pretty easy. It's just that I probably already know all this stuff.
"Okay. So it would be pretty easy, so if it's pretty easy, what do you have to do next, Billy?"
"Like, well, I went out and picked out some forms and stuff, but it's really confusing how to apply, so I just couldn't - I don't know. I couldn't do it."
Okay. So you actually went to the Polytechnic -
"Yes, yes."
- and accepted a few forms?
"Yes, yes. Has been passed around and everything."
Wow.
Yes.
"That's fantastic, Billy."
"Yes, but I correct--Like, they wouldn't help me, so"
Okay.
-I got some forms and -
Tell me what happened when you told her - as if it hadn't helped you? What-what-happened?
"I asked them what I had to do and they said that I had to fill out some forms, but"
Yes.
"- well, the forms, that's too confusing."
Okay. So they gave you a bunch of forms for a certain course?
"Yes, yes. Well, I got one - I got one for panel [incomprehensible 00: 19: 33], and one for, er, er, how, panel and paint"
""
"-so, learn how to paint cars and so on."
Yes.
Yes.
"Okay. So you got the forms, took them with you - took them home?"
"Yes. I wanted to fill it in, but then I didn't get it, so I took it home, but I wanted to get Donna to help me, but I just couldn't."
Mm-hmm. You said the forms were confusing?
Yes.
Yes? What is the most confusing thing about it?
"I did not understand how, what you should write down. How, yes. I am not good at it, perhaps too confusing."
"Yes. So, if you have to write something or fill out forms, how was it for you?"
I don't really deal with it. I s-- I don't really like to write.
You don't like to write?
No.
"Yes. So I wonder what it is all about, namely, not really liking writing."
"No, I'm really messy, so people can't read it."
People can't read - people can't read your handwriting?
"[giggles] Yes, no. It's what they say, yes."
"Oh, you have to be a doctor."
"Yes, I am. [giggles]"
Yes? [giggles] Yes?
Yes.
Okay. So you need help filling in the forms?
"Yes. Like a computer or something. If you could write on a computer, I could do that."
""
But we don't have a computer.
"Okay. All right, so what do you have to do, Billy, to actually get to the point where you can fill in a form and send it off?"
"I think I could ask Donna, but it was embarrassing."
"Okay, so you feel it would be embarrassing to ask Donna for help."
Yes.
- because you feel that she could find out something about you that you are not quite sure you want her to find out?
"Well, I don't know if it's that serious, it's true."
Okay.
"-I am sure that most people can fill them in. I do not know, I just do not understand."
Hmm. Who else could you ask to help you?
Nobody. I appreciate you. You could do it. Would you?
"Well, do you have the forms with you?"
No.
"Okay. I wonder about that - because it sounds as if this whole idea of filling out the forms is getting in the way of that bigger dream you have, which is to get a qualification that has something to do with cars."
Yes.
"- and to come to this street, where you keep yourself out of trouble because you have this, um, interest -"
Yes.
"So it seems a real shame that the forms get in the way, so we have to find a way around the forms."
""
Yes? What do you think you can do about the forms until next week?
"I guess I would pick her up and I don't know, I think I could ask Donna, but she would probably help me, I don't really want to."
"It would probably help you, but you don't really want to. It sounds like you are a bit embarrassed."
"I don't know. Besides, I don't know if I could take the trouble to get up at nine in the morning and go to Polytec. I got used to sleeping in."
""
At night.
"So, the whole thing with going back to poly-- back to school --"
Yes.
"- back to polytechnology - would require a really big change in the way you live at the moment, and you are not quite sure you can do that."
"Yeah. Er, it would be cool if it was something like school. Like, I didn't really enjoy school. [incomprehensible 00: 22: 56] So writing and stuff, and I wouldn't want to do that."
"Yes. So there's something about your level here - about how confident you are in writing, or how insecure you are, that sounds like it's getting in your way."
"Yes. No, it's in my way. I just don't want to do it."
Mm.
It's a waste of time.
So it sounds like we need to have a few more conversations about that.
Yes.
So what is really standing in the way?
For what?
"Well, this writing business. What is really standing in the way?"
"From what? Well, I don't understand."
"Well, I wonder how - it sounds as if it is something you accept as if you cannot do what you want."
"Yes, I can't."
- so I wonder where you are around your writing and what you are reading?
"Oh, it's pretty [incomprehensible 00: 23: 47], but, like, silent -- I don't know, I'm not delayed, or anything. I can write and read."
""
Yes.
"Yes. Well, I have to say, I think it is really obvious that you are not delayed."
Like-minded people
[giggles]
Yes.
"Yes, we are having a really good conversation here."
Yes.
So reading and writing is not a strength for you.
"No, not really. Yes, I don't really enjoy it."
""
Yes.
So how much reading and writing is in the course you are going to take?
"I don't know. Hopefully not many - not much, but that's what I want to find out, I guess."
So what if you were more confident reading and writing? How about that?
That would make everything easier.
""
"Exactly the same - I don't really like reading books or anything like that, so I don't really care, just, say, real stuff like going to the bank and so on."
Mm-hmm.
"-yes, you have filled out the forms."
Yes.
Yes.
And I guess there will be manuals and things like that.
Yes.
"-your course, which, you know, is one of the practical things, it sounds as if you are really self-confident, but it is the more reading, writing, book, something you do not do -"
"Yes, I didn't think about it."
""
"Yes, that would be great if you had to read something like a big manual. Hmm."
"Mm. Okay. So, like before, you get to where you had that dream, and there are a few things that have to happen before."
""
"Yes. So, mm, we have to think about what the very first step is."
So you're sick of it?
"Yes. I-I'm right -- I can't shoplift anymore. You know, I'll get caught again. And, uh, you know, I-I've been suspended, I've gone back to school, so I-I-uh - I'm going to mess up my whole life here, unless I can stop this."
Mm-hmm.
"Yes, it's bad. Me and my friends, we agree - I mean, it's fun and erm - so I don't know what to do, but I need to change."
Okay.
I want it.
"So it sounds as if you are ready, you are ready to give up."
Yes.
But perhaps the path is not so clear.
"Right. I don't know what I'm going to do, I have a few friends. These guys are - it's bad news, but they're my friends."
Mm-hmm.
"And, er, and it's fun."
And it's fun.
You know?
Mm-hmm.
"We go in, we steal these CDs. It worked out well, but -"
Er-huh.
Thank you for coming in today. I guess you've been sitting in this seat with a lot of people like me in the past.
""
"Yes. And you have some ideas and experiences on that. So I want to be good today that we talk about it and, um, I'm really interested to know what you've been thinking about, what you want to change in your life, because we're going to be working together here for a while."
"Right. Neat. What, erm, what have I changed, what am I -"
"What you've been thinking about lately, um, about getting your life back on track. ""Because I've noticed that you -"
I thought about how easy it would be to deal with P again.
Yes.
"I mean, I was thinking, um, how could I position myself properly if I did it wrong."
Sure. So what I'm picking up on is that this is a life you know a lot about.
""
"And you can make a lot of money and position yourself well. What's the other side, because when I talk to people like you who have time, they often think about whether life might be different, mm. So I wonder where you stand with the way of thinking -"
"Well, in the end, you know, I was in there last week - I had this kind of, okay, what's the next buzz? And, you know, it just doesn't work here."
Okay.
"I don't have, er, er, I don't know what that is."
Sure. So life from the outside is very different from life from the outside.
Yes.
-the expectation of life inside something?
"Yes, it's worse."
Yes?
Yes.
"So tell me how you dealt with it. ""Because I don't know if you've had to deal with it again?"
"I don't have that yet, I think."
Okay.
"-that, er, the offer is there."
Yes?
"Um, I don't know why I haven't said that yet, but I mean:"
"Er, tell me."
- she is here.
It is there and - and you have many contacts?
Yes.
"You were in the system, so much context, so this is not a new challenge for you."
No.
What has stopped you lately - how long are you out now?
How long have I been on the road?
Yes.
"Three weeks, one day."
"Three weeks, right?"
"Three weeks, one day."
So what was there? What is it about you not being able to do it in three weeks in one day?
I don't know.
"For 22 days, you have indeed decided not to resume your old life and move on."
"Um, I'm kind of in it and I don't know exactly why. [clears his throat] I don't know if, er, there's no real reason why I haven't done it yet. It's just that I don't think it's going to work the way I always dream, I see myself as, whatever, if I do it again, the next leg is a long one. A really long one."
Okay.
And I-I can't go back there. There's no way I can go back there.
"Right. So on the one hand you could sit down and take the risk, but on the other hand you know that it might not last?"
"No, never permanently."
Mm. They seem to me like a small crossroads.
Yes. I have been at a crossroads for 12 years.
But there were times when this fork in the road was more concentrated than in other times.
Yes. And- [crosstalk key]
Yes. And it might sound like:
"-Kind of opposite, yeah."
Yes.
"You know, we're in the middle, you know, and it's actually right now, I guess."
Yes.
"But I don't know. You know, it's very clear that it's not a damn idea."
Okay. Okay. So -
Do you have an idea?
"No. Well, I have a lot of ideas, but I'm really interested to hear your ideas because you know and there might be some things we can work on."
""
"But I guess what really interests me is that for 22 days you have committed yourself to being drug free. You haven't got back into that lifestyle yet. What's holding you back because you're at a crossroads, you're kind of just pausing at the moment. I'm not sure about that other bit over here. What's holding you back in that place?"
Fiona?
Yes?
Yes.
Tell me about Fiona?
"She told me it's over if I do it. You know, I mean, she--What tell you about, Fiona I mean, she was with me. She's the one who's been through all this shit."
Okay.
-something.
Okay. So how long have you been with Fiona?
12 years.
"12 years. Okay. So she stood by you for a while, but this time she said, it happens again that I'm not here?"
Yes. It has actually reached the black-and-white line now.
Okay. And it sounds like you are listening to this black and white line.
"It's pretty simple - you know, she could be pretty busy."
"Yes, yes."
"Yes, so it's hard to ignore that line."
Yes.
"I mean, and it comes with a lot of different rules, and you know, she's never been the way she is now."
"Okay. So something has changed in your relationship between you, yes?"
Yes. I think she has it. I don't think I have it.
Okay. So what does Fiona want from you?
"I mean, she just wants someone to be there. I. She - she remembers me and she wants - she wants him."
"She wants him, so who does she want, Daryl?"
"The one, you know -"
"Does she want him - did she want him, with whom she fell in love and saw great things?"
Yes it is.
"Or does she want him, who keeps getting into trouble?"
"No, no. Nobody would want him. I don't want him. He's a shit guy, right? She wants the one she fell in love with."
Okay.
Yes.
So what does it take to win back the Daryl she fell in love with?
"If I had the answer, I wouldn't have to sit here."
"Sure, yes."
"And I mean, honestly, I don't know, man. I don't know. I-I wish I knew where to start, you know, could give it to her, but I-I can't. I-I don't know."
"Well. Well, let's just play with that idea a little bit, Daryl. So, what did Fiona fall in love with? What were the qualities of Daryl that she said: ""That's him""?"
"I was pretty romantic. I mean, I was pretty smooth, and, um, you know, I was at my game, like, She- and she loved it. And we laughed in the [incomprehensible 00: 06: 45], you know? And straight - it was always really cute, and people used to say, ""Oh man, you two. You just got it,"" you know? And we lost it, so whatever that was, that's what she wanted. We were young. How do you get young? Er, you know, I'm old, and we're getting old, but you know?"
I know.
"If I'm not careful, I will be."
"Sure. Everyone will age, but it will happen in time."
"Yes, absolutely."
"Um, but that's okay. So she fell in love with that, the fun, the sense of Daryl and things have changed, but she's still with you?"
Yes.
Yes?
Yes.
Yes. And you are still with her?
"Yes, yes."
"Yes. So catch up with me with the conversations you've had with Fiona about that crossroads you're at. You know, in those 22 days you haven't come back, you're out and you're not back? You could just pick up that deal and probably train here tomorrow and come back in."
"You know what? She hasn't even talked about the business, like, she won't even touch on this topic. She's that black and white. She'll make suggestions, you know? What I could do, and - or I'll handle it somehow, but none of them are -- you know, it's nice that she really finds things, but it's not the things. I mean, I've started to kind of appease her and make it okay to keep making suggestions to me, but like, I've got to come up with something because it's like a great love, but you know, not in love, and she's sick of it already."
"Okay. All right. So things start to get tense at home again, and your relationship a bit?"
"A bit of that. Yes, a bit tense. Yes, that's fair."
Yes. Don't put words in your mouth. I'm sure if that's the case -
"No, they are."
"Oh, yes? Yes?"
"I mean, not as they were, because we have just started the new path, but I think tense is the right word."
"Secondly, I would like to talk about this whole idea, Daryl, that's this intersection idea, yeah? So here on one hand you have this 12-year history of being in the other system and you have a while and you're away from Fiona, but you're back now, you're back together and you have a choice where to go. So, in this ""where to,"" what ideas did you think about where this -- this Daryl, non-acting guy -- should go?"
"Well, I don't know. I don't have a little bit of, er, nuggets of where I could go. I just feel like I should go somewhere."
"Okay. Yes. So a part of you knows that you have to do something else, but the direction doesn't seem to be so clear right now?"
Yes.
It [incomprehensible 00: 09: 33] picks up?
"Yeah, no idea."
"No idea. Okay. So I wonder, you've been in the system for a while. You're 34 now, is that right from the start?"
[nods].
"Yes. You know, at 34, guys often start thinking about being with a girl in their lives and what's important, and - and you would have been involved - not as a guy, so they actually made some changes and thought, ""Time to move on."""
"Yes. Well, um -"
And now you have -
Not many.
Not many?
Mm-hmm.
But some.
"Um, oh, I did. Yes, one. [giggles]"
One?
First.
Yes.
"Mm, yes."
Yes?
"Okay, so, uh -"
Tell me something about it.
"Well, he was - he was with me when I was first in, and now he's a drug counselor."
Okay.
So he is - he has done it.
Did he?
"I don't know how the hell he did it, but because he wasn't even really addicted, he was right - I mean, I don't know. He's very good with people."
Yes.
"Really good at talking and, er, but I still don't know how he did it."
"Cool. So how would you be interested in finding out more about how he did it? ""Because I think about it, this is someone you know, someone you've spent time with, someone you have a relationship with."
"Yes, but I can never be a drug counselor."
"No, I am not proposing to you - no, it is not a question of being a drug counsellor, but of him making the transition from crime to crime."
Yes.
- to a transition about being in a different place.
Yes. I think he would have found a higher Power. They found - I will not find any of them.
"Okay, not a 12-step higher power idea?"
Yes.
"So that could work for him, but what could work for you?"
"I don't know, that's why I'm here."
Sure.
I don't know what that is.
"Okay, so it's going to be part of our presence here with me and the work we might be doing to find, try and find that."
Okay.
Whatever that is.
Good luck.
"Well, it's a search, isn't it?"
"Yes, I don't want to be rude."
No.
- but I think it's a big question.
"Yes, that's a big question, so what qualities would you need to bring to go there?"
Shit.
Guts? Yes?
Is it a quality?
I think so.
"Yes, I would need some of them."
"Yes? So you are the guy who has courage, Daryl?"
Am I?
Yes.
"No, not yet."
Not yet?
"Well, no, I'm not."
Yes?
"No, I don't have that much courage."
And yet you are sitting here with me today.
"Oh, I have to."
-and-and-and-you talk about stuff.
Yes.
"Well, you are sitting here talking to me."
"Oh, okay."
-about stuff that is quite profound -
Yes.
"- in a way. Um, that takes courage. That takes courage."
All right.
I think so.
Okay.
"Cause you could have come in and said,"
It's a bit embarrassing.
"- ""Look, Ken, you know, I'm coming in, I'm out here."""
"Oh yes, I could have done that."
"You could have done that, but you're not. So I wonder what's different? ""Because you might have done that in the past, I don't know, Daryl, with other people like me, but - but it sounds different this time."
"I'm older, you know? It's not that much fun."
Yes?
"I used to take the piss out of you, guys."
Yes.
"- all day. We all do, but"
Sure.
"- That's not funny. I mean, and you're a good guy, I imagine. I mean, you didn't deserve my shit."
I feel a sense of sadness when you have to think about it.
"Oh, sadness. You know, I don't want to wallow, you know? You know, you have to take, you know - you make your own chance in life, don't you?"
Yes.
I just never did.
"Okay. So I'm interested in this idea, let's, er - opportunities come and go all the time."
Do they?
They do.
"Well, not for me."
"Well, you said, before you had the chance to pick up and get back to business."
"Oh, yes. Oh, plenty of those opportunities."
"And - and so - so there are opportunities - there are opportunities in one world, and I wonder what might make it difficult to see opportunities in another world?"
"Yes, well, the other world doesn't give me opportunities. The other world gives me a night shift and a minimum wage, and, you know, nothing. So it's like, set yourself up, set yourself a goal, or, erm, not, and that's your pro-social life, and that's your, you know, old behavior."
"Safe, secure. You are in the system"
Mm-hmm.
"-You are not in the system. Take this on, where will it lead you?"
The system?
"Yes, what will happen when you start acting again?"
"Man, I fought this system."
Yes.
- and everything that brings me back is within -
"Okay, okay."
-I mean -
"So once again, I am-I wonder about this other world, and you say that it doesn't look very attractive at the moment."
"Well, I can't see it."
You can't say?
"You know, if I knew what they would look like?"
Yes?
-I could buy that.
Yes? You just described to me what it looked like a minute ago.
Did I?
Minimum Wage
Oh yes.
"night shift, gas station."
"Yes, it's not much fun, it doesn't look very good."
Yes?
"Yes, it looks really tough."
Yes? It's really difficult.
"I know that's the right thing to do, er, don't get me wrong."
Sure.
"It's just the right thing to do, to go to a job you hate, to go home, to cook, but to miss a dinner, to look after your kids. I mean, that's what it really means, but I don't have the courage to do what you do."
"Sure. We've talked about courage before, and you have the courage to talk to me about this stuff today, and I wonder if you actually have the courage to think about these ideas. I'm not saying you want to pump gas at the minimum wage, but - but the courage to actually dive into this other world. I wonder if you have that, I'm not sure."
"I-- Hmm, maybe."
"Maybe. You're not convinced at the moment, I understand that and, um -"
"No. You know, convince me, because I want to be somehow."
"Sure. Well, I find it hard to convince you."
Correct.
"- ""Because this is your life and this is your story, and you - you have to go your life and I can't go your life for you. I'm just going my life. And so, but I can go with you on this life to try to think about it -"" Because I - I - have no interest in you tipping over and going back to a lifestyle that is a crime, ""because I know where it's going to take you. And I hear that in your relationship, wherever it's going to take your relationship [incomprehensible 00: 16: 39]."
""
"So it seems that what is going to push in that direction just has to tilt the balance a little bit to give that other world a chance? Because it's new, it's different. It means doing things, a lot of things that are actually like that - that's kind of banal."
"It's the little things, yes, like waking up, having a cup of tea and sitting on the porch is kind of cool."
Is that cool?
Yes.
Not part of the plot?
"No, you're not sitting outside."
No?
-on the veranda.
And who is sitting with you on the porch?
"Nobody. It's tomorrow, it's just me."
Mm-hmm.
"Birds, trees, yada yada."
Cool. So I take in this world and actually have the freedom to be your own man?
"Mm, you may know."
Maybe?
"That was nice. If it was so full, of course, but I mean, you know, at some point you have to go to your job and"
Yes?
"-You know, pay your - your wages, I mean yours - your mortgage and -and-"
Yes.
- it's just massive.
Yes it is.
It is.
"And, erm, is there a challenge you have to face to create something of this kind of world for Fiona? ""Because I hear that -"
"You know, people like me are not accepted in this world. You know? I have it - I don't have qualifications. All my mates work fantastic jobs in Australia, 160K a year in mining, you know? Just men digging holes. Like, if I could do that, yeah, all right, but shit, I just got out of jail, I don't have NCEA. I, uh, I had an opportunity and I fucked that because I can't do a night shift because I'm lazy. You know? Maybe the world gives me opportunities and I just don't need it. Maybe I can't."
"Sure, so what I'm hearing is that you're not convinced at the moment."
"No, I'm definitely not convinced."
"No. So what would convince you to make that shift? ""Because I hear a lot - and in that tough time when you have time and then when you have a record, the employees - you know, we know, I know that. It's not easy. You can't just wonder about a job, a high-paying job and say,"" Pick me, pick me, pick me. ""I know that."
No.
You know that.
"Yes, I know."
"So, um--And -- and maybe it's about small steps and first steps."
"Yes. I mean, yes, it's obvious, it's first steps, but I mean, what is that? What's the first step into pro-social life?"
"Well, you might try to get a job and get into some routine."
"I just know that if I get a job that I hate, I just won't do it."
Okay.
"You know, I can do in an hour what I can do in a night or a week of nights. It's pretty - you know where I'm from? - You know, there's no decision at all, it's just like, what do you do if you don't?"
"Yes. At the moment I am confused because you say, ""Yes, I could do in one night what you do in one week,"" but you don't have that."
Yes.
"- and you have not done so, so tell me what you are talking about."
"I just told myself I wouldn't do it this time and then Fiona said: ""You won't."""
"So you told yourself you wouldn't do it, so once you're you - you're the guy who, when you've made a decision, stands by that decision?"
"Yes, even if it's the wrong one, yes."
"Oh, it's a decision whether it's right or wrong - it's not going to happen."
"Yes, but I'm that guy."
"Yeah, you're that guy, okay, so when you made a decision, you made a decision that you didn't gonna- you're not going to go back to business?"
"Oh no, there was no decision to make, I just said, ""I'm not going to do it yet."""
Yet.
"Yes, I said."
They keep the door open.
Yes.
"- at the moment, it is what I pick up."
I hate that.
"Yeah, okay, so that's going to be a call you have to make."
""
"I am-I am not gonna- I am not going to make this call. You are going to make this call, but there is a consequence of making this call, and there are probably bigger consequences if Fiona is not there. On the other hand, what I am recording is a call to do something - to do some things that may not be fast and exciting and in the big bucks, but I am with Fiona and making this transition to another life."
"Mm, yes."
Yes.
And we're still no closer.
No.
"But I mean, it's there."
But we're talking about it.
Yes.
How long have you been talking about this?
"Oh, damn."
position?
"With someone other than Fiona? No time, I would say, for about 10 hours with you."
"Okay-okay, so the fact that we're even having a conversation about it is kind of interesting?"
Yes.
"Yeah, so I want to summarize, Daryl, what-what I've picked up so far and then just to make sure I listen to you really well 'because it's important, right?' Because it's important that you're listened to."
""
"So what I pick up on is, if you have this long 12-year history, you can make a lot of money, or you can do business, commit crime, this stuff, I am - I pick up that Fiona determines the end result, is if you go back in that lifestyle, she's not here anymore, but she's stayed here 13, 12, 13 years?"
"Yes, 12, almost 13."
"s how she stayed with you, and I take in what is important to you, er, and - and yet you talk about it, it just seems, this little bit here, this whole lifestyle."
""
"This different lifestyle here, although when we talk about it, actually think about it, you know, doing things, doing the stuff that everyone else generally does, [incomprehensible 00: 22: 30] will continue, it doesn't seem to have the same kind of excitement, and it doesn't seem to be a starting point for you here."
"Er, that it seems kind of exciting."
Oh yes?
It does because it's so different.
"Right, okay."
And I'm kind of happy with that.
"Okay, you're through with it, okay, so let's start thinking about what the first step might be."
Yes.
"Yes, I think you got a high steep slope when you went in."
"Okay, me."
"Yes, a steep path, as you can see, before you had a mate who turned his back on the insult."
Yes.
And for him this 12-- you wondered that the 12-step things work for him.
"Yes, yes, it works for him."
"Yes, maybe I wonder how he actually had the conversation with him that maybe there is, and how he stayed with it without slipping back over the line, ""because like at that crossroads, you have the path and you go the other way and you go here, so through the conversation with him, I wonder what it takes to have that conversation."
"Er, he rings."
Ring him?
"Mm, yes."
"Yes. You seem to be a little surprised, I am [talking] and wonder at the surprising face."
"You know, it's been a long time since we've been in there. I just know he does. It would be pretty strange to call, but he would probably agree."
So the ability to call?
Ability to call yeah.
"Yes, it is possible."
Yes.
"Yes, okay, and Fiona was pretty steadfast."
""
Is someone who actually has a pretty clear idea of where you should go as a couple?
""
'I've got a feeling.
Yes.
Yes.
"Well, I just have to do what I'm told. I don't know."
"Yes, but I'll pick her up, even though she has some hopes behind what she's doing."
"Oh, yeah, I was, uh, I mean, she has more hopes than I do, you know."
So what will it cost to reflect on some of their hopes and share some of their hopes?
"Er, like I do - I do, but what it would take, you know, I mean, it's pretty freaky, scary shit."
Yes?
Yes. And I would never admit it.
"You said before you're some kind of guy that once you've made a decision, you're pretty steadfast on that decision."
Yes.
"So if you make the decision to go there, it could be scary like shit, but again it seems that it could work if you see it, that's important, this relationship is important, let me go -"
"Yes, but when I made my decision not to do that yet, I knew that I knew that picture. If I was going to make a decision to do that, I had to somehow really know what that was. You know, not just talk, I mean that."
Sure.
"- what is the whole plan to call you and say, hey bro, hey bro, er, how did you do that?"
"Yes. That's what I think - I really think. Here's someone who actually made a different decision than then, er, it sounds like that's the path that starts all over again, and I wonder if you might have some wisdom about what it's like to go down that path."
"Yes, I think I might be surprised."
"So you know that part of you goes, I thought at this point that's hard work."
Hmm.
And this is quite a lonely way to walk alone. I wonder who else could be near you who could actually walk with you?
There's Fiona.
Yes.
"[incomprehensible 00: 26: 37] Out of that he did something like that. Um, Dad is just so mean. There's Fiona."
You may know that they will go down this path with you.
"Yeah, okay, uh, all right, all right."
There are a few people.
Yes.
"If you want that, you have to be."
"So, erm, what brings you in today?"
"I don't know. I'm just having a little bit of, er, a little bit of trouble with, er, my criminal past and, er, you know, I'm trying to stay on the right track, but, you know, er, it's just - it's going to be, you know, kind of overwhelming, you know. Er, I really want to be a good productive member of society, but at the same time, you know, I have this background that no one's going to overlook, you know. So it kind of gives the impression, well, you know, I'm going to go back to what I know? I mean, you can only work for $5, $6, $7 an hour for so long, and it's really frustrating."
It really gets in the way of who you want to be.
"Yes, that's right."
Yes. So what-if your criminal record blocks you from getting where you want to go?
"I don't know what's wrong with that, um -"
"There's a, er, your record has a conviction?"
"Yes, it leads to a conviction for a crime."
"Okay. Oh, there is -"
"And, er -"
- the big problem. Yes.
"Yes, it is. And I didn't expect it to happen - you know, so it was just like, ""Okay, cool. I'm not going to jail."""
Mm-hmm.
"You know, and, um, now it's like, okay, so it's more of a life sentence than a four-year sentence that they offered. You know, I mean, I think it would have been either way bad, but, um, I didn't expect it to be that difficult, especially since I went back to school and, er, graduated and actually wants to do something, er, corporate level or, you know, professional kind of work."
"Mm-hmm. So when you submit, erm, applications or something like that, the criminal conviction, whether you know it or not, seems to throw you out of the field of applicants."
"No, I'm not. Um, in situations where I don't know, I don't know, I mean, if I'm not considered because of that, I probably understand -- um, you know, that's annoying too. Don't get me wrong."
"Mm-hmm, mm-hmm."
"- I'm sure. The ones that really count are, you know, kind of easy, you know, uh, what makes me so angry and, you know, kind of spills over into the rest of my life or those that look me in the face, especially after a really good interview. And, you know, most of the time I interview extremely well. And, uh, it's, you know, I get the impression that the job is offered almost half the time because, you know, they start telling me what I'm going to do and what I'm going to get. And then, you know, when it comes to signing the papers and I believe in honesty, so I tell them, you know, hey, look, that's what you're going to find, you know, and, uh, try to explain it."
Mm-hmm.
"Black and white. It just stops right here. ""I'm sorry. I can't really do much for you. I.e. you have to go,"" you know, and it's -"
"So, erm, did you publish anything about the felony conviction before you even went to the interview?"
"No. I mean, there are different situations, you know. Sometimes they ask me and, you know, I say something like, you know, ""We're going to discuss in an interview."" Er, sometimes there are situations where if I say that, I probably don't get a call back and those situations that I don't know about. You know, but there are also times when I get an interview, um, you know, uh, uh, some connection or something, or like, like a mate of mine or a family member sends me to an interview. You know, I don't have to fill it out."
It looks like it's a done deal.
Yes. It looks like it's a done deal. You just have to go through the application to do the interview.
Mm-hmm.
"- when I go through the interview and it's going well and they say, ""Okay, well, I think we can do something"" and then, ""Here, sign, sign that,"" and the other thing. And it's like that, but we just had a great, I mean, I qualify. Like that seven years ago, six years ago, what does that have to do with anything? Now, mainly because, you know, the kind of conviction, it wasn't a no-no - it wasn't a violent conviction. It's not like I was a danger to the people around me. It's not like it was some kind of theft. It was, you know, it was an obsession, you know what I mean?"
Mm-hmm.
""
So they didn't harm anyone.
"No, I didn't."
"They didn't do any harm, did they?"
It's really frustrating.
Yes.
"""It's almost like I don't want to give up, but it's like I have no choice, you know?"
"Yes, ""because it's you, especially when you go back to school and you've done all that footwork and stuff. I mean, you really have something you can offer someone."
"Yes, I do."
"Yes. And, erm, and back then the big crisis was maybe the prison and the whole arrest crisis - and, erm, you know, it's like you're a leper and a leper colony."
Mm-hmm.
"Um, were there times when you started the interview with this conversation so that you don't even have to go through it and then get rejected?"
"I can't think of that, no."
Mm-hmm.
I think -
What do you think would happen if you did?
Likely to start right away.
Mm-hmm.
-you know? Um -
"Would that be, erm, what would they be like if they didn't get through this great interview, if they knew you were good for the job and all that stuff, and then they would boot you out?"
"Well, it's shit one way or the other. You know what I mean?"
"Mm-hmm. It's, er, I mean, the lesser of the two evils is that what we achieve"
Mm-hmm.
"- Do you know what I mean? If it will make things more efficient, as if - if you are what you are trying to say, if that is something I could do, and if they get through it, then I now know that there is an actual intention of people to hire me."
"Right. If this is a breach of contract and you both know it from the beginning, I wonder if the interview is really anything else. I mean, if they really get the job, it would be based on the interview and not on your criminal record."
"Yes, I think, in terms of maybe efficiency, you know, sorting things out, not wasting my time, you know, but I had to tell you something, a lot of people who don't care about those kinds of things."
Mm-hmm.
"- are not the kind of jobs I really want to do. Do you know what I mean? Um, I don't know, it's just really frustrating."
"It's not like you're working for the government or for a bank or, you know, for the FBI - these are not things you apply for. They're jobs where you wonder why a nonviolent crime would happen in the first place."
Be an issue.
Correct.
"Right, and then that's someone else I could tell you that."
Mm-hmm.
- that does not matter -
Mm-hmm.
- are probably not jobs worth getting the interview.
"Mm-hmm, you didn't go to college for that."
Correct.
""
"You know what I mean? If I want to work in a removal company and tell them in advance, you know, I tell them I'm convicted of a crime just so you know before the job interview and they don't mind. I mean, that's great, you know, but at the same time I don't think I want to be a removal company or not."
Mm-hmm.
"- a burger pinball or something. Not that anything is wrong, but I feel like I have a little bit more to offer."
Mm-hmm.
"-You know, and, erm, I don't know, it's really, it's like being caught between a rock and a hard place."
"Mm-hmm. So what did you look at, er, you know, advocacy in this area or expulsion or something?"
"I did it, and my eyes have, you know, become like mush after all the reading I've done about this situation."
What did you find out?
"I found out that I have the type of, um, crime that can be triggered, I don't even have the type that can be sealed. I apparently have the type that has to go to the governor's desk next to death row, you know, inmates or candidates for, um, a government - a governor, er, pardon."
Er-huh.
"- that has to be, if anything, the only option I have is the governor's grace, er, and I can't understand why that's the case - it's, I mean, I just, maybe there's a loophole somewhere, I don't know."
"I-I didn't know that. So I, you know, I know a little bit about, um, and not, yeah. So that's very interesting. Oh, what about interest groups?"
"I've looked at, er, a few groups that purport to help convicted criminals break free."
Mm-hmm.
work.
Mm-hmm.
"Er, just again - I mean, I think what I saw was a whole bunch of, you know, dead-end jobs."
Mm-hmm.
"And the other thing I saw was that it was very politically charged. You know, I didn't think that I was allowed to get, um, you know, sort of an interview with one of those advisers that they were offering. Um, I think it just didn't seem like some kind of place that was willing to help, you know. And - and, er, I saw that there was a lot of, um, I wouldn't say racism, but I would say a bit of racist courtesy, I suppose. And uh, I found it really hard to get in and get an interview with a consultant to reconcile me with a job. Um, I think those groups are cool when they're working."
Mm-hmm.
You know?
Mm-hmm.
"Um, you know, I don't know. I don't know if there's anything else."
Mm-hmm. So you're the Middle East. So you're asking yourself - I bet you've had experiences where you've really experienced absolute racism and prejudice because of it.
Mm-hmm.
"And then, erm, you walk into these places, and they're maybe just window dressing."
Mm-hmm.
And the job market is terrible.
"Right. It's, er, it's piled up a lot against me."
Mm-hmm.
Let's just put it this way.
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
"You know, erm, but it's not -"
What do you have for yourself?
"That said, I mean, erm, I'm able to um-- I'm able to have a conversation."
Mm-hmm.
So at some point I might imagine that I might be talking to the right person.
Mm-hmm.
"I don't think it depends where you went to school. I think it depends who you know. You know, we live in a very politically charged city. And I think even if we don't live in a politically charged city, jobs are so rare at this point in time that people who know people are the ones who end up, er, in the workplace."
Mm-hmm.
"And I think if I go on to school, you know, and, uh, you know, uh, you know, you get time from this crime, you know. So it's seven years and -"
That's a long time.
"Yeah. And at some point I probably don't even have to report it anymore, you know, and I have that for myself. It's been seven years. I have the fact that I'm, you know, uh, good at, uh, interacting with people, that's good."
Mm-hmm.
"You know, erm, I've been clean of this kind of lifestyle for so long, so that's - that's up to me, you know, that's that - that's good."
And this can be proven and documented.
Yes.
Yes. A lot of people can't.
They don't.
"Yes. And you went to school. I mean, your entire movement is in this really positive, highly motivated way. And, around - and I think your - thoughts and ideas about the fact that one day there will be a conversation - you will meet someone and it will happen to be someone who works for a company that may not have a policy against hiring people with criminal convictions."
"Yes, that's my hope."
It is individual. Yes.
"Yes, that's my hope."
It's individual.
"It is. It should be. You know, I-I -"
I think so.
Yes.
I do not think there is any state or federal law that says that.
"No, no. It is an individual, but you are right. Yes."
Okay.
But here's the thing -
"Right person, right company -"
Correct.
-We are looking here. Yes.
"The thing is, you know, after the September 11 attacks, a lot of companies blindly implemented these kinds of situations, you know, and there's none at this point - I mean, I don't think there's a really safe way at this point to find out what those reports are, you know, exactly or not. I mean, there's a lot of situations where people's reports aren't even accurate about their criminal background."
Mm-hmm.
I think that -
Mm-hmm.
"- Blindly, people have implemented these kinds of, um, measures and they're not efficient with it because they're not - you know, I mean, everybody is offering background checks and stuff now. And I -- that's one of the things I'm afraid of is that people are implementing all these security measures, but they don't really know if the reports are correct at all, you know."
I wonder what it would be like if you did your own background check and got the report to see what was in it.
I have.
"Oh, you do?"
"Yes, I have one and, er, um."
Good for you for doing that.
"Right, yes."
"Yes, clever."
Yes. Thank you. I don't know.
Discouraged.
- what I really am -
"Discouraged, yes."
"Yes, I am really here because I think that I am a very dangerous area for myself if I am discouraged because"
Mm-hmm.
"- You know, all that - despite all the good things I have for myself, the only things that are loud and clear are the things that I don't have for myself."
Mm-hmm.
If that makes any sense at all.
"Er, yeah, it does. Er, I'm still in it - it seems to me right now, in that time that we've been talking to each other, that you, uh, uh, have a sense that a lot of it, with, uh, timing, happiness, who you know and who you are, is able to have that conversation where you know you can sell yourself and your skills and, uh, and your skills and the fact that you've overcome so many things like, uh, the substance abuse problem and, uh, you've been a good upright citizen all the time. Uh, for me, if I was an employer, you know, that would impress me."
Thank you very much.
"Er - you are welcome. And - well, erm, I know I had a client who told me a few things. He worked on it, er, if you were interested - if you were interested, I could tell you what he shared with me."
"Yes, yes, I am."
"Okay. Er, he found the most valid information on blogs of serious criminals."
"Oh, okay."
They are your experts.
Very interesting.
"And, er, they - they're actually, er, er, a lot of what you said, they said, but they also talked about what places and businesses they found were open. Family businesses, for example, just tend to - they can do it if they can."
"Yes, it's like that again, you know, right?"
"Right, right."
I know that.
Or start your own business. That was another thing I thought was real.
"Yeah, I think that's what I have. That's what I do. That's what I kind of have to deal with now, you know, I think, uh, you know, I'm still going to school, but I'm also starting to, uh, work for myself. Um, you know, it's not a Fortune 500 company or anything, but I have a little bit of income that comes from that."
Er-huh.
"Er, it-it, er, you know, it's all going to come together."
So being an entrepreneur suits you.
"You know what? One of the things I've read is that that's one of the things you've got to do is just, uh, start your own business. Do you know what I mean? Uh, you don't have to report to anybody. I mean, obviously I can't work with it unless I get a decree that I can't work with, like, I think the law says I can't work with kids or, um, like a hazmat stuff."
Mm-hmm.
Like driving trucks and stuff.
Mm-hmm.
"Er, but that doesn't matter to me. You know, I try to look at the things I can do."
"Well, that's, you know, a very different way of looking at it now than how you look at what you can do, as opposed to what gets in your way that you know you can't do."
Correct.
"So, erm, what kind of - what - what are you doing? What is this business? If you don't have to tell me if you don't want to, I know it's coming and going, but you don't have to tell me if you don't want to."
"No, it's, er, like, party planning, you know, wedding planning, not like a wedding planner, but like -"
You would be so good at it.
"Like, you know, like corporate events, when they've taken place, you know, like an event, you know, they need"
Er-huh.
"- You know, they need chauffeured transportation, limousines, they need something like that. I, er, I'm involved in planning transportation from the airport, er, hotel arrangements, er, booking the rooms, er, you know. It's simple, I guess just an event planner, but it's not through any kind of company, er, er, company [incomprehensible 00: 19: 40]."
You-You would be the company.
"Yes, yes, yes, I try"
Managing Director.
Yes.
[Laughter]
"I don't know, but you know."
"Yes, I've heard that in a recession, erm, that's often the best opportunity for people to start a business, is to see an area where you see a need to go and fill it."
"Yeah, I think it's my only, er, er, I know it's not my only one."
First.
"- but it is - it's a good, it's a good opportunity to, um, kind of work for myself. I'd love to just be able to work for myself, you know? Um."
Do you feel comfortable with that?
"I feel good, I feel good about it, and I'm fine. I'm doing well, you know, the few opportunities I've had to organize something like that. Um, it's fine. You know, um, at least I'm still going to school, but you know I'm done with it."
I know that's fantastic.
"I don't want to live out, you know, I mean, I am, you know, I think I have"
Acting would be what?
"Well, you know, I don't know, erm, I'm going back to a lifestyle, you know, crime or, erm, using, or you know, just destructive behavior."
Okay. Gottcha.
"- and a kind of destructive behavior. I don't want to be destructive, I want to be productive, you know."
As you are now.
"Like I said, I mean, I wouldn't have come in if things were just peach-colored, you know what I mean? It sucks, and I'm sick of, you know, rejection, and it's like almost, it makes me think, why am I going to school at all? You know? Should I just drop out and just get jobs that, you know, I mean, that's not enough, that's not a viable option for me. You know, I just think, I don't think I want to make sure I'm here so that I can go out and do the best I can by keeping my composure, and then try to move forward. But if I'm not okay here, you know, I don't think I have a chance, you know?"
"So the law of, uh, criminal convictions is something that you have no control over. I mean, nobody does that. So, uh, you know, and I think about how you talk about coming all the way through the interview and then being rejected, you know, on the contrary, being informed in advance and even on the phone to see if it's a breach of contract or not, because it has to - it sounds so much more difficult to have that good interview and leave the ad that you did well, and then be rejected."
"Yes. I mean, I recently had one of those offered to me. Yes, I think he was - I'm pretty sure he offered him a really good job."
Mm-hmm.
"And, uh, it was an interview my brother gave me, you know, who knew the guy. And, uh, it went great until he gave me the paperwork to sign for a background check. And I said, well, you know, I'm signing it, but I just want you to know that you're going to find it."
And your brother didn't know there was a background check when he gave you the job?
"He said, you know, don't say anything until you know - I don't know if I know what he said. I think he said he wasn't sure if they did."
Okay.
"He said, just keep going and try it anyway, you know, and, uh, I just thought I'd just give it a try, but I think I like you, I think to spare myself some, uh, frustration and more torment."
Mm-hmm.
"-I think I could try. I think I could try, you know, from now on, you know, erm, like a tactful way of asking, you know, I don't want to be blunt and say, ""Did you hire criminals?"" or anything."
You are not a criminal.
But I am a former criminal.
"That's right, you're rehabilitated."
Yes.
A shining new guy.
"Right. So I know I'm a new guy, but, erm, they don't, you know, so I think society is a lot less forgiving."
"Oh, I think so."
"And individuals, and erm, so I think I'm going to try - I think that's a really good idea is sort of weed-sorting, you know, but how do you say that? You know. How do you tell someone, you know, how do you do that - how do you get that out there before you go in?"
"I think I would just tend to say it. I'm a recovering person, and back in my previous life I had a conviction for a crime. And before we go any further, I don't want to waste your time. Er, would that be a problem getting the interview at all, what would you think about saying something like that?"
"Hmm. Seems, uh, kind of forward, you know, but I-I think it's probably better if I tell them so I don't waste my time and my hope."
"Mm-hmm, mm-hmm."
"You know, yes. I think I'll try from now on."
"Okay. I mean, I would be happy if you want to work on a few things, you know, things that sound comfortable and appropriate, you know how you talk and use words and stuff. ""Because I-I also think, you know, interviews are a good school - a good skill, and the more you do it, the better you get on with it. And you've gotten a lot of practice with it, so that's also useful."
Yes.
"I mean, even if you're rejected, it feels terrible, and I bet you get better with each one."
Yes. I mean the interview process.
"Er-huh, uh-huh."
"No, I mean, I don't think I have a problem with the actual interview process."
Yes. I bet you're even better now.
Yes. It was a lot.
They have a lot of practice.
"A lot, yes."
"Yes. Well, then at last, back to, er, that other source, that same client was an interest group called the John Howard Society."
Mm-hmm.
I don't know if you've ever had a
I've heard about it.
Yes.
"-still looked at it, but -"
"Er, er, er, er, he- they've got a lot of, er, they've got a lot of really good stuff about them because they're trying to change the laws around it."
Yes.
"- they are so, erm, they are so harmful, they really are. And I would also ask the ACLU. I mean, just like I-I don't know much, and now I'm very curious and want to find out for myself, but yes."
Yes. I know. I did some research for the school.
Mm-hmm.
"And, er, it turns out it's a big cause of the relapse rate."
"Oh, absolutely."
- as far as people go backwards -
Absolutely.
"- to what they know, and, er, and it is, er, there is prejudice- er, biased motivation, er, and there is -"
You are not allowed to vote.
It's really frustrating.
And you're not allowed to vote.
I think that - I think - I think that ignorance is what really -
That shocked me when I found out.
Yes.
I couldn't believe it.
Yes.
"You know how many millions of people and when you think about it racially, um, hmm."
"Yes, exactly."
"Yeah, mm-hmm."
"You know, I know there's - there's just a lot - a lot of bullshit."
Mm-hmm.
Yes.
That's a great word for it there.
"Yes, to find out anyway [incomprehensible 00: 27: 30], you know."
"Yes. So maybe - if you want to, and it's really up to you, you can look at the blogs, you know. Er, I can see if I can track him down and the John Howard Society. And uh, I'd be really interested if you want to sit down and see what you found out."
"Yes. I-I, you know, I, you know, like I said, I want to make sure that I come back and, er, somehow, I mean, er, you know, get my overall sanity."
"Mm-hmm, mm-hmm."
"- You know, erm, I wouldn't say stable because I'm not that unstable."
But that affected her.
It affected her.
"Rejection-rejection, yes."
"Yes, rejection. Yes."
Yes.
"So, I just want to make sure I'm OK."
Yes.
"-I will be back and we can, you know, continue to discuss it if you have any information and I will share everything I have."
ll do a few checks for you. Yes.
"Well, thanks for the suggestions. Yes."
"Oh, you are welcome. Thank you for being so open to me. I appreciate it."
No problem.
"Yes, OK."
Thank you very much.
"Okay, so why not flush it out, David. How are you?"
Okay.
"Good. Look at that, see what you think."
Yes.
"- and the color is fine? You know, there are quite a few spots, so, erm, I just wonder, erm, some concerns about smoking."
Oh.
""
I will relive that.
"coffee, tea. Yes, you have heard that before, I am sure."
"I do all the above, yes."
"Mm-hmm. So you know that smoking will not only be associated with some of the other negative consequences. You know that it physically affects tooth decay, tooth decay and tooth decay."
Yes.
"-um, healing -"
Yes.
-in the mouth.
Okay. Sure.
""
"I've heard it all before, but I just want to get my teeth in order."
"Yes, and I really want to be helpful. I really want it - you know, my commitment is to your oral health, so erm, there are a lot of medications, David, that actually take a lot of cravings. They make quitting so much easier."
"I did one thing with the pill, so I tried it. Like, I tried it. I just made the pills and they didn't work."
Mm-hmm.
It was wasteful and caused more side effects
"No, but David, it's not a waste. Research shows that people make an average of about seven attempts before they stop smoking, so remember if you're one step closer to quitting, so be it."
Or seven lectures by the wayside.
"Well, I don't think I'm going to give you a lecture, I certainly didn't mean that."
"No. No, I just feel like that. I really get it -- I get very defensive when they bring it -- because I get it from my family doctor, from my cardiologist, from everyone. I'm like, I'm not a complete fool. I'm in favor of smoking, but -"
"Well, there's a reason people are worried."
- but it is not easy to stop.
"No. But as I said, these drugs - so you tried the drug, you were once ready."
Yes.
"Can I then write you a prescription for the medicine? Can we talk about how to use it? Because it is something that is very important, not just for your overall physical health, for your oral health?"
"I think I had to really want it and - things I've tried, usually caused me more problems than they helped."
"Oh no, smoking will cause you more problems than anything else, I can promise you that, David."
Okay.
The side effects of the drugs are nothing compared to what can happen through smoking.
Mm-hmm.
"Like, I think that's the thing that really needs to be considered."
Okay. Can I go now?
"I'm okay, but you know."
"I-I-I know, I know - I know what you're trying to do - but I just don't want to go into that now."
"Okay. Well thanks for listening, and honestly, I'm really worried about smoking, so --"
Okay.
""
I appreciate your care.
"I'm here to help, okay?"
Okay.
""
"Okay, I've finished the exam. I have some good news and some less good news. Looks like you don't have cavities, so that's the good news."
That's great.
"But I'm pretty worried about something that I notice in your mouth. If you look up here, the roof of your mouth, I notice a lot of irritation that's really consistent with tobacco use, and you said on your form that you're not a tobacco user, so I just wonder what's going on."
I don't smoke cigarettes.
"Okay. Well, as I said, there's a lot of irritation, especially, as I just mentioned, up here in the mouth canal, it's really definitely stained white and there are little red spots. And you probably didn't notice it because we don't spend a lot of time looking at the canal canal, but you're damaging that tissue in the mouth that can cause really serious problems in terms of your oral health. It's called nicotine stomatitis. And that's something we don't see in any patient who doesn't use tobacco. So, maybe you don't smoke cigarettes, smoke a pipe or cigars? Or is there anything else that could contribute to that? Because I don't know what else it could cause."
"Well, the only thing I've ever smoked - I've never smoked cigarettes, erm, but, erm, when I go out with my friends, erm, we like to go, you know, we like to go to lounges."
Mm-hmm.
"And, uh, you know, sometimes it's these - these, uh, nice young men who give you different things, and we have some of these mini cigars that are Swisher candy, they come in peach and grapes and - and, you know, that's the only time I've really consumed anything that contains tobacco."
"Okay, so I think that's a pretty common misconception because they're fruity, people think they're OK. That's really bad for you. Did you know?"
"Really? Bad? But they are just little, mini, little, sweet little girly cigars."
"That's right. It's still cigars and it's still tobacco and so they still cause lung cancer, oral cancer, emphysema, all the same things you would see with cigarettes, so it's really important."
"I mean, it's not like I smoke 20 or 30 cigarettes a day, I mean, I only do that when we go out."
"Er-huh. Well, that's, I mean, at least you're not doing that, so that's good, but it's still causing a lot of problems. And as I said, I see that the evidence in your mouth, you're causing serious damage, and that needs to stop. Have you thought about quitting?"
"Well, I didn't really know I had started."
What do you mean by that?
"I didn't really think it was more than just socialising, just something I do in a social environment when I go to bars with my friends."
So you're going to stop then?
"Er, maybe."
"What do you mean? I just told you how bad it is for you. It makes your mouth clutter, you expose yourself to all these other diseases. It's really important. You have to stop."
"Well, that's something I have to think about."
"What is there to think? [giggles] You said you don't do that very often, and there are all these negative side effects, all these risks you expose yourself to."
"Well, it's just something I do to relax, and I don't do that very often, so I could probably cut back."
"Okay, that's a good start, but cutting back won't be enough. If you actually quit smoking, you can undo all the damage you've done to your mouth and you can stop putting yourself at risk for these other diseases, but as long as you continue to use these cigars, you really are putting yourself in great danger."
"Well, I don't think it's cigars, and what I think is that it's a decision, and it's my right, and it's something I want to do, and so I'm going to think about cuts, but I'm not at a point where I'm ready to do it, and I'm not really sure if I even believe that what you're telling me is real."
"There are a lot of really negative things that come with every tobacco consumption, whether it's cigarettes, cigars, dip, chewing, snuff, snus, hookah or anything like that. It's a really important decision that you make and you say it's your choice, but you really choose to get sick and potentially die. I don't know if you realize that your teeth are getting yellowish than they were before, which is another side effect."
"Well, I'll think about that."
"I hope you will really think about it. You know, it is something I will continue to question you about, because it is something that really needs to change."
Good morning. It is really nice that you have come to me to talk to me about quitting smoking.
Good morning.
"What do you have in mind, what do you want from us?"
"Well, I need medication, if you can offer me any."
"Absolutely, we are in the right place for that."
"And, er, whatever else you can do, just to get me to get smoke-free."
"Okay. Well, just remind me again why you want to quit."
"It's just these days - I think it's me these days - I realize that, erm, I'm smoking 20, 30 a day, I've had enough of it. It's, you know, I've seen my friends stop smoking as well, and it's like they're looking at me weird these days, as if I'm the only one who still smokes."
"Oh, good, and I feel so pressured here."
"Especially the other day, when I was in the restaurant, it was a bit embarrassing - you know, it was a bit embarrassing that I was the only one going out."
"It sounds like one of the reasons why you have to stop, because it stinks a bit and it becomes embarrassing."
Mm-hmm.
Any other reasons?
"Er, it's expensive these days."
How much does a week actually cost?
"It's that time of year - er, I buy and go through a pack every day, so it's almost £7."
£7 a week or a day?
"£7 a day today, Sun"
So pack your pack a day -
"You're talking £40, er -"
£50 a week.
£50 a week.
"See, more chaos."
Yes.
"Okay, so we're talking about spending £50 a week."
Yes.
"- To be one of the few who smokes in the crowd, and not to like the smell. That sounds like three reasons."
Mm-hmm.
Do you think that is enough to say goodbye to cigarettes?
Yes.
"Great, okay. So do you have a date in your mind when you want to quit smoking?"
"Well, what are you doing - what are you proposing?"
"In general, it works well if you find a time when you are not under a huge amount of other stresses and strains."
Mm-hmm.
What are the main reasons why you smoke? What do you enjoy the most?
"Um, it's just entertainment. Something, er, when I'm bored, it's god--I have god--I smoke -"
Mm-hmm.
"- or sometimes I go out, but as I said, I am the only kind of outsider."
Okay. What do you think you will miss the most?
"Um, that takes a lot of stress out of me."
"Mm-hmm, what loads?"
"Just, er, when I - when I go down, er, for a break at work."
Mm-hmm.
"I never go down, I just need a break from it all, just shut up. So, erm, I really enjoyed it. Cigarettes only help me to calm down."
Yes. And what is your favourite cigarette of the day?
It's definitely the end of the evening.
"Okay, so the day ends."
Yes.
"-the thing that helps you just switch off, finish the work part and go into your own time."
Yes.
Okay. What do you think when it's your first day at work and it's time to go home when you stop smoking?
"I guess, uh, I'll sort it out - I'll just have a bit of fresh air, but this time without a cigarette in my hand, but maybe to give myself regular breaks, I don't know."
Okay.
It's one of those tough things.
Have you managed to quit smoking in the past?
I've been doing it for a couple of weeks.
Okay. And what brought you back?
"It was, um -- to be honest, it was stress from an argument with my partner that I remember."
So something just happened.
Yes.
"I just make sure I understand what's going on here. You really want to quit smoking because you're kind of the last man in your group to smoke, it costs a lot of money and you don't really like the smell."
Mm-hmm.
"The main reason you smoke is that it gives you some sort of relaxation at the end of the day, and if there is quite a bit of stress, use cigarettes to cope."
Mm-hmm.
What you would like to do is quit and choose a time to quit when there is not as much stress as possible. When do you think would be a good time for you to decide to quit?
I guess there's going to be a party at the weekend.
Okay.
"So, erm, maybe Monday morning."
"So Monday morning after the party will be a good day, and that's next week. Okay. Well, one of the things we do at the pharmacy is that you use medication to help you. You know that this increases your chances of success and makes it more likely that you can cope with cravings that occur. Many people like to use nicotine replacement therapy, which comes in a variety of formats like patches, chewing gum, you've probably seen that people use one of these products. And other options are tablets that you can get from your GP."
Mm-hmm.
"So, yes, again -- um, so do you have something in mind that you want to use to help you manage your cravings?"
"Yes. I think, um, one of those spots."
"Okay. So a patch is something you have already seen, and"
Yes.
"- and again I'll get them out and show you what they look like. This drug course lasts 10 to 12 weeks and we strongly recommend that people stay on the entire drug course, and that gives you the best chance of success. Quitting smoking is not easy, but it is possible and with the kind of support we offer here at the pharmacy, you make your chance of success absolutely four times greater than on your own, so it's really good that you came to me. Well, what you said is that you really want it and that the next week sounds like a good day for you because the party is over and over."
Mm-hmm.
"At the end of the day, you have time to finish work, which may be the first time you give up a cigarette, so what I would recommend is that you use maybe two products and I think that you have a patch and then suggest that you use something that you can refill. Often, a smoker knows exactly how it feels when he yearns for a cigarette. How does it feel for you if you can't have a cigarette and want one?"
I just get irritated.
Okay.
Yes.
And that is exactly one of the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal that I do not want to inflict on you any more.
Hmm.
"I will talk to you about how to use that and that we have another product that I will leave you to use rather than one of those feelings of irritation, especially in this first week."
Okay.
So are you happy with the date for [incomprehensible 00: 06: 16]?
Absolutely.
"Okay, and would you like to come back and see me again?"
"Well, definitely."
And what would you expect from me if you didn't come back?
A nice call.
I would love to do that.
"Okay, so I wrote a prescription for an antibiotic for Aiden and that was supposed to help with the ear infection, but when I look through the table, I mean, it seems like he's had six or seven of them in the last year alone."
Yes.
This is really a big problem.
"Yes, it's quite stressful for both of us. He gets really upset."
"Well, one of the main risk factors for multiple ear infections in children is actually smoking exposure. Do you smoke?"
"Yes, I smoke, but I don't smoke around him. I really try not to smoke around him."
"Well, the fact that he has these ear infections indicates to me that he is exposed to the smoke, and what can you tell me about that?"
"I don't know. I mean, I try really hard not to smoke around him. I don't smoke in the car. Um, when he's at home, I go outside to smoke. I'm right -- I mean, I know it's bad, and I know it's bad for him, so I don't want him to be there, so I try really hard."
"I really need you to quit smoking, both for your health and for Aiden. Did you know that smoking around your child is not only associated with ear infections, it could get to the point where you have to put tubes in his ears pretty briefly? Also things like vitamin C deficiency, cavities, such as dental cavities, behavioral problems, um, asthma, other upper respiratory infections. It really puts him at high risk. Also, children of smokers themselves smoke. Do you want him to grow up to become a smoker?"
"No, but I don't smoke. I - I-I-I-I-I thought about quitting, but it's true - It's really hard, so I just don't know how to do it."
"It really has reached the point where you can no longer smoke, not just for him, as I said, but for you as well. You put yourself at risk for lung cancer, emphysema, oral cancer, heart disease, all sorts of things."
"I know, I know. I've heard it - people have already told me, I've heard all of it. I just don't know how to do it. How to stop it? It's so hard."
"There are patches, lozenges, chewing gum, the inhaler, the nasal spray. We can talk about medication. You can try Chantix, you can try Zyban, there are groups of smokers you can go to, there are hotlines you can call."
I just don't have time for that.
"There's no reason why you shouldn't stop, that's really important."
"I know that. I mean, everyone has problems, right? It's just really - it's really, really hard."
"Now, what could be more important to you than your child's health?"
I don't know.
"I really need you to tell me you're going to quit smoking, which is really important."
I will - I will - I will - I will look at all these things and - and I will find out - I will try to find something and - and I will talk to my doctor about it.
"Okay. Well, I think you really have to think about it seriously. As I said, it really puts you and your child in danger."
"Okay, whatever. Okay."
Okay.
"Sarah, I am so glad you came to your women's exam today. I think we raised many of your concerns, but I would like to ask you more about your smoking. Would that be okay?"
"Yes, I guess."
Okay. How much do you smoke in the course of a day? You said that it had gained weight over one or two times a day.
"Yes, uh, usually I smoke, you know, like once in the morning, uh, once during my lunch break and then maybe like five or six in the evening."
"Okay. So about eight cigarettes. So in the course of a day, half a pack?"
Yes.
Okay. And that changed in what period?
"Um, honestly, it's probably been the last year or so that I've smoked a bit more."
"Okay. So smoking has increased in the last year, especially in the evening?"
"Yes. Um, I have a two-year-old son, as I said, so I never try to smoke around him, so I usually kind of wait until he gets to bed."
"Mm-hmm. Well, this is the time to relax and unwind."
"Yes, exactly. You know, I told you that my schedule is pretty crazy right now. I, erm, I work full time and have just started the evening classes again. So, you know, all of that combined, you know, I enjoy that time for me in the evening."
"Sure. Sure. Well, it's a time to relax and you have a lot to do."
Mm-hmm.
So are there other things you can do in the evening to relax?
"Er, I mean, maybe I'll have another drink or two."
Okay. One or two drinks. So how many drinks would you have in the course of a day?
"Um, maybe like two max."
Two max. how many drinks would you drink in the course of a week?
"I don't know. I mean, I don't really understand why you're asking me that. I mean, I just came here for a regular visit. I'm not here to talk about my drinking."
"No, I understand - I understand, and I'm certainly not here to tell you what to do, Sarah. I'm interested in hearing your thoughts and sharing some information with you, and what you do with that information is entirely up to you. You have a lot going on. You're a mother, you work, you go to school, and our health team wants to make sure you have all the resources at your disposal to achieve your goals, including good health. And my job as a health care provider is to listen to you and share information with you, including health issues related to smoking and alcohol. Would that be okay with you?"
"Yes, I guess."
"Okay. Well, we know that an increase in smoking and alcohol is associated with certain types of cancer: colon cancer, cervical cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer and, um, pancreatic cancer. It is also associated with liver and lung disease and heart disease, diabetes and high blood pressure, so that is a lot of information, but I am sure we disagree with that increase."
Yes.
"- interested in what your thoughts are, Sarah."
"Well, I-I'm just kind of surprised because, I mean, I don't smoke or drink that much. And I mean, compared to people I work with, I smoke a lot less, and I feel like I've actually tried to keep it pretty low."
So they are deliberately trying to cut back.
Yes.
"I have a standby ruler in my pocket, 0 does not mean at all ready to quit smoking and 10 means absolutely ready to quit smoking. Where do you see yourself on this scale?"
"Er, maybe like a five."
So you're halfway there. So why did you choose a five instead of a four?
"Well, I mean, you mentioned some weird things, like, you know, cancer risk or something like that, and as a mom, I don't want anything to happen to me."
"Right. Well, that's a lot of information to think about. Given that these health concerns are a possibility, and that you are worried about your family, and that you certainly have goals you want to achieve, the question is where to consider making a change. In other words, what steps would you consider to bring that number closer to a 10?"
"Well, I mean, I might try to shorten the evenings a bit."
"Okay, great. Let's quantify that a bit. How many cigarettes would that be?"
"Well, if I have five or six now, I could try to smoke three in the evening plus, you know, still the couple during the day."
"This is a big step, and since we are running out of time here today, I wonder if we would be prepared to come back in about four weeks to review this plan."
"Yes, for sure."
"Okay, all right. So we can review your lab results at this time and review your plan. Do you want to know something about quitting smoking now?"
"Yes, I think that would be very helpful."
"Okay. Well, I have a brochure here and that's it - it's a really good brochure. It contains some diversion techniques in case you get that nicotine craving."
Mm-hmm.
I would also like to ask you if you would be willing to see one of our consultants?
"Well, for what?"
"Well, Dr Kirtley is one of our consultants and he is an expert in discussing the link between alcohol and stress and I would like to share something with you: national guidelines recommend that women should not drink more than seven alcoholic drinks a week to stay at that low risk level, to avoid the health concerns we have talked about before."
Mm-hmm.
"You have indicated that your alcohol intake is slightly higher, putting you at risk, so I asked you if you would be willing to speak to Dr Kirtley."
"I mean, I'd like to talk about my stress, but I'm still not sure what all the drinking is about."
"Of course. I'm glad you're willing to talk to him, so before you leave here today, we'll, er, drop by the dispatcher's desk and make an appointment so you can see me in four weeks, as well as the appointment with Dr. Kirtley. And that way, before you leave, you're done. So have any more questions for me, Sarah?"
I don't think so.
"Okay. Well, it is very nice to meet you. I will see you in a month."
Okay.
"Hello, Sandra."
Hello.
"Thank you for coming and talking to me for a few minutes. I understand that you do not have much time, but I appreciate very much that you drop by."
"I think it's important to quit smoking, but I enjoy smoking. I'm not ready to give it up now. My life is too much in turmoil."
"So I have the impression that there are some things you are worried about, but overall, it was not necessarily the first thing that came to mind when you came to the hospital with your daughter. Um, can you tell me, what was it that made it possible for you to come in at all? What were you thinking about?"
"I think it's important because I feel like I'm a bad role model for my children and because my daughter is 12 years old and because some of her friends have already tried to smoke, I don't want her to think it's a good thing."
The last thing you want is for your daughter to start smoking.
"I smoked when I was young, and I certainly don't want it for them."
"Hmm. And it sounds like your smoking, setting an example, those are some things you're a little bit worried about, erm, but as you said, not really ready to put down your cigarettes right away."
"Well, that's right. It seems so hard. I'm just not ready for it yet."
"So Sandra, what's good about smoking? What do you like about it?"
"It's very pleasant, relaxing, you know, a stress relief. When I'm at work, we all go smoking and chatting and talking about things. I'd hate not to smoke, really. I'd be left out."
Tell me what else is good about it.
"Hmm, I like a cigarette after eating. It tells my brain that I'm done, I stop eating, I'm full. So it's a - it's a way to get there - you know, sometimes I take a cigarette instead of a snack, so it's a way to control my weight."
"Okay, so is there anything else you like about it?"
"I think it's, uh - it's not good for me, I know, but I'm so used to smoking. I don't really think about quitting too much."
"So let me make sure I understand all the good things about smoking, the things you like about it, and let me know if I've missed something or left something out."
Okay.
"It sounds like it's a way to relax, it's a way to socialise with your friends from work, and it's hard to imagine what it would be like for you at work if you couldn't go outside and smoke."
"Yes, that's right."
"You also mentioned that smoking is a way to get your weight under control, and that if you stopped smoking, you would be worried about what that would do in terms of, um, weight gain, and that smoking after meals is pleasant, that it is something that would be really hard to give up."
Yes.
I have also heard that it is very much part of your life. It is something you have been doing for a very long time and it is almost impossible to think about you as a non-smoker. Does that cover some of the good things or things that prevent you from smoking?
Exactly.
So I hear that there are some things you really like about smoking. What about the other side? Can you tell me some of the less good things?
"Well, I-I'm worried about my kids. I feel like a bad parent, and erm, I often wonder, you know, they've seen me smoke for years. I definitely don't want my 12-year-old daughter to start smoking, and some of her friends are already smoking."
"Sandra, can you give me an example from a time when you did something that you think made an impression on your daughter or set a bad example for her?"
"Yes, just this morning I was outside having a cigarette and when I looked up she looked out the window and watched me smoking."
"So this morning, this experience, it really brought home how she is watching you, and she is really looking up at you and realizing what you are doing. How did it feel when you looked up and saw how she was watching you?"
"I felt terrible, you know, I projected - I want to be a good parent, and I don't feel like that's really part of the plan."
"I guess this is a difficult subject. It's a difficult behavior to think about giving up. Um, I guess one thing that doesn't make sense to me is that on the one hand you talk about how important it is to you to be a good parent, and that it's really important to you to set a good example for your daughter."
Mm-hmm.
"-um, and on the other hand I hear you say that smoking is important for stress reduction, sociability and something you can't imagine ever changing. How do these two things fit together?"
"It doesn't fit, you know. It's the other side of the coin. You know, I love doing it, but I don't think it's right."
So what would it take to quit smoking or to change it to be something more important that has put it on your priority list?
"At the moment, I can't think of anything."
Okay.
"I have no plans to quit, it's just something I'm thinking about."
"So it's not so much that you don't want to stop in some way, it's almost like, ""How could I do what would work for me?"""
Exactly.
We have probably used up the time we have. I would be happy to see you again next week if you would be willing to make another appointment and talk to you more about it. Is that something that would be helpful?
"Oh, for sure. Sure, I'm coming in. Yes."
Okay. So I hear -- [crosstalk]
We can talk about it a bit more.
"[chuckles] Not necessarily the most exciting thing you should do, but I appreciate your willingness to do it. Can I also ask you to do a bit of homework by next week? I promise it's not too time consuming. Um, we have a pamphlet that we would like to give to people who are thinking about changing, who are not sure if they are ready to do so, and one of the exercises is to write down your three main reasons for change, why you would even consider quitting smoking, and then think about some of the good things we talked about, as well as some of the less good things about quitting and continuing to smoke. Would you be willing to do that in the next few days?"
"Okay, okay, I'll give it a go."
"Okay, here we go."
Thank you very much.
"So thank you, Sandra, see you next week."
All right.
So I wrote a prescription for antibiotics for Aiden.
Okay.
"Um, but I wanted to talk to you. I'm a little worried when I look at his chart of how many ear infections he's had lately, and I noticed that you ticked the box that someone in the apartment is smoking, so I wondered if you could tell me a little bit more about it."
"Well, erm, it's just me and him and me smoking. Er, I try really hard not to smoke around him, but I-I've been smoking for 10 years, except when I was pregnant with him. But it's all so stressful being a single mom - and I have a full-time job. So it's true - that's why I started smoking again."
You have a lot to do and smoking is a way of relaxing and destabilising.
Yes. Some people drink a glass of wine. I have a cigarette.
Sure. And it sounds like you are trying not to smoke around him. Why did you make that decision?
"I know it's not good for him. I mean, I've read these things about ear infections and asthma and stuff like that, but other kids have ear infections and their parents don't smoke."
"So, on the one hand, you are worried about how your smoking might affect it and, on the other, you are not so sure that it is really smoking that causes these problems?"
"Yes. Yes. I mean, he doesn't have asthma. Yes. Yes. I don't - he doesn't have many other problems that his other friends have, so. And I've thought about quitting before, but I just don't know - I just don't see how it's possible now."
What made you quit smoking when you were pregnant?
"Well, he was in me and we shared everything and I knew he was going to get something from it and I didn't think I could live with myself if something happened to him."
"But right now, it almost feels too difficult to even make it, or even try?"
"Yes, exactly."
How were you successful when you stopped before?
"I don't know. I - I'm thinking about it now, I don't even know how I did it. I just did it. You know, I just did it - I just couldn't imagine that he wouldn't be born or go into labor early."
Mm-hmm.
"- and - and he has problems and stuff like that, all the stuff they talk about with women who smoke. So me - that was just enough to say, ""Okay, you know what, I'm - I'm not going to risk that."" like that."
Mm-hmm. The risks were so scary back then that you could stop?
Yes.
But don't they feel so scary now?
"No, I mean, we're two different people. And like I said, I don't, I try really hard not to smoke around him. I'm pretty good at it. I-I don't let other people smoke around him. Um, so I, you know."
You're doing the best you can.
Yes.
Okay. But it also sounds to me as if a part of you really wants to stop?
"Yes. I-I know I have to do that, and I say every new year, ""Okay, this year I'm going to quit smoking,"" but then something happens and it just doesn't happen, and quitting doesn't happen."
It's on your to-do list. It just doesn't make it to the top?
Yes.
"If you have decided to stop on a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is not safe at all, and you don't think you can do it and 10 are you pretty sure you can do it, where do you think you will fall now?"
"Probably like a 5th species in the insecure realm. I know I've done it before, so I know I can do it, but at the same time it seems to be really difficult, and it's not the same situation."
"Well, what made you say five rather than two or three?"
"And I don't want him to grow up and think it's OK to smoke. I don't want him to use any kind of tobacco - I don't want him to chew or anything like that. Um, so I know I have to do that, especially before he's old enough to understand what Mom is doing, but I just don't know if I can."
Okay. So it sounds like you have a lot of reasons why you want to quit. You've quit successfully in the past and you're feeling a little hesitant about your ability to do it?
Yes.
What do you think will happen next?
I don't know. I would like some help. I just don't know what kind of help I need.
"Sure. Well, if you were interested, I can definitely talk to you about it. There are a lot of new options that can actually help people to stop trying to be much more successful. There are different medications you can try."
I don't like medicine.
"Okay. There are also a lot of support groups and courses you can take with you when you have other people going through it with you, and sometimes just that support can be a big part of it, especially for people like you, where smoking is such a stress relief."
"That sounds nice, but I'm not sure I have the time for all that."
Sure. It feels like something that would take a lot of time and might not fit into your life. I wonder if we could talk about some options that might fit into your life.
That would be really nice.
"Okay. Well, if you are ready, we could make another appointment where you could come in and we could talk more about it."
"I would like that, that would be great."
Great.
Thank you very much.
Sure.
"Okay, the hard part is over, so the good news is there are no cavities."
"Oh, great."
"Yes, I am always glad to hear that, but I do have some concerns because I see a palate irritation in the mouth called nicotine stomatitis."
That sounds bad.
"Yes, it is. It is palate damage caused by smoking tobacco, so I wonder if you can tell me something about how tobacco fits into your life at the moment."
"Tobacco. Well, I don't smoke cigarettes. I've never smoked cigarettes. I go out with my friends. Um, you know, we go to bars and, you know, we're going to have a few drinks and smoke some of those little cigar-like things. I mean, I wouldn't even think of them as cigars, and they're certainly not cigarettes. Um, and I mean, I'm going to have one or two of them in an evening with, er, my friends, but certainly not 20 or 30 of them a day, as you would with cigarettes, and that's the only thing that could have anything to do with tobacco."
"So you made a decision in your life not to smoke cigarettes, that was something you didn't want to do. It sounds like you are a bit worried about the health effects of cigarettes, but you have smoked the small cigarillos at least once or twice every time you go out."
"That's something my friends and I do. We don't have a habit or something I need to have, and when we go out in the evening, we talk about one or two things."
"Yes, so no - you're not like these chain smokers, you don't smoke packs and packs a day."
Oh no.
"The amount you smoke is so tiny that you can't even imagine it doing any harm, and yet here it damages your mouth."
"Well, now that you mention it, erm, I started having one or two people at work, you know, when we have a break, because I have a couple of friends at work who smoke, so every time we have a break, we go to that - the break area outside, erm, and so on - now I go with them and I have one of those Swisher sweets. Erm, I like the peach flavor [incomprehensible 00: 02: 32], they are so sweet. But that's really only recently."
"Uh-huh. So smoking has become a big part of your social life. When you go out, you smoke, and even during work breaks, you smoke."
"Well, yes, yes. You know now that you say it in a way that is true. Um, I smoke every day."
"Apart from this social aspect, what do you like about it?"
"Well, it's relaxing and it's just nice to be with people, erm, and you know when, you know, I like going to Las Vegas, and when we go to Vegas, it's really fun to go to the cigar bars, it's quite challenging and it's fun, so it's mostly a social thing."
Okay.
I wouldn't say I was a chain smoker.
Okay. How about the other side? Have you noticed any less good things about smoking?
"Well, I wanted to ask you about, erm, teeth whitening because I noticed that they have more stains than a few years ago, so I imagine it has something to do with smoking."
Yes. So we're seeing some pretty negative effects on your oral health from smoking. Are there other things you're worried about?
"Um. Well, there's the cost, you know. Wi-Fi with the economy and everything, erm, I have to be careful with my money and so there's the extra cost if I buy more of it than I used to. So the money aspect is also a concern."
"Mm-hmm. So there is oral health, there is the financial aspect, and then you have previously raised some concerns about smoking cigarettes and how that can be harmful to you."
"Oh, yes."
"Did you know that smoking these small cigarillos, the Swisher Sweets, can have some of the same negative health effects?"
"Oh, absolutely not. I mean, I thought it was more of a fun thing to do with my friends, certainly not a smoking habit or anything that would be harmful."
Mm-hmm. So it's kind of surprising to you that something you've done and are doing more and more of is actually pretty bad for you.
"Oh, yes. I ticked the box on your form when you asked if I use tobacco. I ticked ""no"" because I never considered myself a smoker."
Mm-hmm. What do you think of this now that you realize that you are actually a tobacco user and that you may actually be causing some pretty serious health effects.
"I'm really worried, I mean, I don't want to get, er, cancer, lung cancer or any of the horrible things that happen when you smoke, and until this conversation I never really saw myself as a smoker."
Mm-hmm.
'I'm very worried.
"Well, the good news is with regard to nicotine stomatitis: at the point where you quit smoking, you can actually reverse all the negative effects that have occurred, and you may also know that you can stop the progression of other diseases that have begun simply by quitting smoking."
Really?
Yes. Is this something you would be interested in?
"I would really do it because, as I said, I am a brand new smoker. I didn't know I was a smoker until I came to you."
"Mm-hmm. Well, if you think about it on a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 really doesn't mean you can do it at all and 10 is really confident that you can quit when you try it, where do you think you're going to fall?"
"Oh, I think I'll probably be in seven or eight years. I'm pretty confident I could stop."
"Okay, what made you choose seven or eight instead of a-a-five?"
"Because it's not part of my daily life. I don't have to have, er, any smoke when I get up in the morning. I don't smoke 20 or 30 of them a day, so it's not that much of a burden and I'm pretty sure I could stop."
"Mm-hmm. So, it sounds like a summary: you have noticed some negative effects of smoking, you have some concerns about the health effects that could occur, there is the financial aspect, and yet you are pretty confident that you could quit if you tried. So where do you think we should go from here?"
"Um, I would like more information about quitting. I mean, I've heard that there are some new drugs out there, there are some new things that can be done to help people quit more comfortably, and I-I really want to quit."
"Okay, well, I would be happy to talk to you more about it and give you some tips and advice and give you some suggestions where you can get help to quit."
That would be wonderful. Thank you.
I appreciate very much that you have spoken to me about this today.
Thank you very much.
Hello Jean. I am Dr. Selby. Nice to meet you.
"Good morning, Doctor."
How can I help you today?
"Well, doctor, I-I have finally made an appointment with you, because more than three months ago I was diagnosed with a lung disease, COPD."
Yes.
And although I didn't call right away. I really need help to quit smoking.
Correct.
"So I thought, well, that's my first step. So, erm, it's time to do something."
"It's time to do something, okay."
A respirologist.
A respirologist diagnosed this and - and how are you at the moment?
"I'm really scared, er, because I'm not well."
Mm-hmm.
"I didn't feel good for a while, I get coughing fits even when I'm on the phone to clients."
"It sounds like you've been smoking for so long and then you get this diagnosis, er, and now it really scares you."
Mm-hmm. I-I don't know what I'm going to do about it.
"Okay, okay. Did you think about when you wanted to stop?"
"I give myself six months, six months and - and, er, that seems like a long time, but I feel like I'm going to fail at this point. I don't even have 50%, er, confidence in myself."
"Okay, so what I'm hearing from you is that although you want to quit smoking in the next six months, you're a bit, er, unsure whether you're actually going to make it, and you're afraid you're going to fail."
"I don't know what to do. I've tried to quit smoking. I've had, er, I've taken pills, I've taken the patch."
Mm-hmm.
They took me to the hospital for a week. That's the longest time I've been out of the hospital.
"Right. So you could quit smoking, but only if you were in hospital."
"I had no choice, I had no choice. And then the next day I was back to smoking what I smoked."
"Okay. Let me just take a step back and ask you a question so that I can better understand what the difficulty you are dealing with is. Er, could you tell me what is good about smoking for you?"
"Er, it's part of my life. It's, er, I started smoking when I was 13, 14 at home. My parents smoked. All their friends smoked. It was on TV. Everyone looked so great."
Mm-hmm.
"Er, smoking and all dressed up - and fancy clothes and maybe a drink in hand and a good meal, um, I didn't really think about it. It's just an extension of me, I think. It's good for my nerves."
Correct.
"I mean, I feel like it is. I know when I have the package in my pocket, or if I know it - when I'm stressed, I say, ""Well, I'll take a cigarette and think about it."""
"Of course. So, Jean, I want to make sure that I understand what you told me about what you like about smoking. It helps you to calm down. It gives you something to do. It's part of your image. You know, you feel cultivated. You feel like you're in a movie style. Actually, the way you talk about it, it seems like that. Is that true?"
That is true.
Okay. Is there something I missed?
"Um, I enjoy it. It's true - it relaxes me. It's great after a meal, er, for me."
Mm-hmm.
"- we all do it as a small group of people, er, my family."
Correct.
The people I work with go to the farm.
Sure.
"- Take a cigarette and talk. That's how you make friends. A lot of people, erm, we're like a small group now, all of us - a small bunch of us."
"So it's hard for you to quit when everyone else around you is smoking, and it's so easy to go out, take a break and have a cigarette."
"I-I never thought it would be, but you're probably right."
"You have told me what is good for you about smoking. Er, can you tell me what is not so good for you about smoking?"
"Well, it's bad for my health and it scares me because I'm not well."
Mm-hmm.
"I didn't feel good for a while, I get coughing fits even when I'm on the phone to clients."
Is there anything else that is not good for you about smoking?
"Um, it has become expensive, really expensive, and I used to smoke 30, 40, sometimes 50 cigarettes a day, and I start buying different make-up because I'm really getting older, wrinkles on my face and my skin is really constipated and I spend a fortune on cosmetics."
"Okay, so let me make sure I understood that piece as well. So, the not-good or not-so-good things about smoking for you are the effects on your health, the effects on your physical appearance and how you will look and - and - the amount of investment you make in make-up and nails, and so on. And then the cost of smoking."
Yes.
"So let me ask you how important it is for you to stop smoking, given what is going on in your life on a scale of 1 to 10, where 10 is the most important and 1 would be the least."
"It's for me, for my health and for the money and everything I've said, I'd say it's 10 out of 10 that I should quit smoking."
Definitely the most important.
"Yes. One hundred percent, one of the most important things."
"Let me ask another question and go into the matter: how confident are you in all that is going on, where 10 is the trust you have ever felt in anything, and 1 the least confidence that you will be able to stop?"
"Er, I'd say 35 or 40% competent."
35-40%. Okay.
"Yes. I would like to say more, but, um-"
"Okay. Now help me understand why you said 40 and not something like 10 or zero, because you mentioned that you don't even want to stop."
"Well, I am - I think I'm still a fighter, and I-I-I'm starting - I'm starting to understand it and I feel pretty good that I've come to see you. I-I-it was a step and a couple of people who actually look after me, er, patted me on the back that I've come to see you. So -"
Mm-hmm.
"- that was a big step. So I think, yes. Er, it might not have been that high last week."
Okay. So you said 30 to 40%. What would it take to increase that confidence to about 45%?
"Maybe if I could come to see you again, or maybe some ideas were suggested, maybe if there was a group or something. I-I don't know, but I-I need help."
"So if you got help, it would help you to say that you went from 40% to 45%."
"I think so, because I feel a little better than I did today."
Okay.
Discussing things helps me. I always feel better when I get something out.
"Okay. Jean, I really want to congratulate you for taking this very important first step in solving this problem that you have had for so long, but as a first small step I wonder if you would be willing to actually monitor your smoking for the next week only. And the reason I'm saying this - because smoking is so automatic for you, as you just mentioned, that writing down sometimes helps make every cigarette a conscious act. And I noticed that you told me you were losing control of those cigarettes. And sometimes it helps you just be mindful and write down something you do. And that's often the first small step. What do you think about that?"
"In other words, think more about it, don't do it automatically."
"That is true, and writing down helps in this process."
"Yes, yes. I think so, because, erm, if I get the urge, maybe I could fight it and, erm, maybe wait until the next urge."
Mm-hmm.
"- and maybe you write it down like, erm, I didn't go right away when something went wrong. Um, yes, I can try it."
"Okay. And I can give you a little map to help you keep track of it. And if you can bring it back to the next appointment, we could discuss it. Okay. Anything else?"
"No, it gives me something to work towards until I see you next week."
"Excellent. Well, thank you for coming today."
"Thank you for seeing me, Doctor."
You are welcome.
Is it okay if we go through the form you filled in? We will distribute it to anyone who comes in.
Mm-hmm.
"All right, so it looks like you wrote that you drank alcohol a few times last year and used marijuana more often in the last year, for 30 days."
Something similar.
"Okay. When students and I talk about their drug use, the first thing I always say is that I don't want to tell anyone what to do. That's not my job. Instead, I want to see if there's anything they want to do, if anything, about their use. So what can you tell me about your marijuana use?"
"Er, I have a pen, but I don't smoke it."
Okay. How many times?
"Um, a couple of times a month."
Do you vaporize anything besides marijuana?
I once made a peppermint oil that someone shared with me.
Okay. Is it okay if I share some information with you?
Mm-hmm.
"We know that marijuana has an effect on the developing brain. For example, it can make it harder for you to concentrate, it can make it harder for you to remember things, and vaping can seriously hurt your lungs. About one in six people who start using marijuana as a teenager become addicted later."
"Well, I don't think it's going to hurt me."
How do you think this will affect you?
"Um, I don't know, it relaxes me and it's fun to laugh with my boyfriend."
"Is there something about marijuana that worries you, a lot of things you don't like?"
"Well, I don't want to get into trouble like I did at school."
How can you get into trouble at school?
"Well, I can be suspended and I would be kicked out of the team, the basketball team."
So is it important for you to stay in school and play on the basketball team?
Correct.
"So when you think about these things, are there any things you want to change about your marijuana use?"
"Well, I was thinking of not using it when the basketball season starts."
What would be the benefits?
"Well, I play better when I'm not standing up."
"Marijuana affects how well you play, what would be the other benefits for you?"
"Well, I wouldn't get caught using a pen, so I wouldn't be thrown out of the basketball team."
"Okay. Well, it sounds like your goal is to stop using marijuana as soon as basketball starts. How long do you think you could stop using it?"
For about a month.
"Okay. If I asked you to pick a number, 0 to 10, 0, which means that you are not very confident of reaching your goal, or 10, which means that you are very confident, which number would you choose?"
"Er, seven."
A seven. Why do you think you chose this number instead of a lower number like five?
"Well, I'm pretty sure, erm, I can't play for a month. I want to play well."
So what steps could you take to help you stop using it for a month?
"Er, I don't know."
How about this question? What could happen within a month that could cause you to steam?
"Well, if I'm stressed or unhappy, I usually want to steam."
What else could you do instead of steaming if you felt that way?
"Hmm, I like playing video games."
Anything else?
I can play basketball with my girlfriend Sarah.
Playing basketball and playing video games is a way to feel better.
Yes.
"Well, I'm glad to hear that you have the goal of stopping for a month, and that you are confident of achieving that goal. If you're ready to come back in about a month, I'd be curious to hear how your plan works."
Mm-hmm.
"Well, good luck with basketball training. If you want something or need to talk about something before our next appointment, I'm here from Monday to Thursday and it's always good to see you."
"Okay, David. So why don't you rinse, and how are you?"
"Hmm, pretty good."
""
"Check it out, yes."
-check this out? What do you think?
"Oh, that was really nice."
Yes.
They have eliminated this evil.
Yes.
-discolorations that existed.
"Yes, no."
I like that.
"Good. Excellent. I have actually noticed quite a few spots. I wonder what you think about it, what could be related to it."
"Mm. Well, the usual suspects, smoking, wine, coffee"
Yes.
-all the above.
Any thoughts about quitting smoking during this time?
"Yes, I've thought about it. I'm right - it's not my cup - I-I-hear it from everyone, and, er, I've tried it - I've tried it before, it hasn't worked. I get it all the time."
"Okay. And it's like I'm another person here, the next person - the next doctor who says, ""You've got to stop smoking, David."""
"Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, [incomprehensible 00: 01: 13] hmm."
"Mm, and I'm sorry, I don't want to get over it."
"Yes, I-I-I know I'm not an idiot and people know that smokers are, you know, ""How can you smoke today?"" [coughs] It's just not that easy, er, to quit."
"Mm-hmm, and if it were as simple as the doctor or your partner say -"
Yes.
-say-
"Er, who wouldn't?"
You have to stop.
You'd have to be a real fool not to do it.
Yes.
-if you [incomprehensible 00: 01: 34] would do it that way.
Yes.
I just hear it every day.
"Yes. And what were your experiences with smoking in the past? Tell me -- can you tell me a little bit about what role it plays in your life, how long you have smoked?"
I've been smoking for 40 years since I was 14.
Mm-hmm.
"- and I stopped a few times, now and then in my twenties, but you know, it was consistent, and I can't see that I'm changing now."
Mm-hmm.
No matter what kind of conversations I get or what they come up with.
"It sounds like you've tried a lot of things that are out there, and it's not something you are -"
It won't work for me.
"Yes, yes."
No.
Yes.
"I know that cold turkey is probably the only thing that will ever do it to someone who did it. Myself - My group, it was cold turkey -"
Mm-hmm.
"- and then they fight against it, but [sighs] it is my choice -"
Mm-hmm.
- And I don't like lectures about it.
Yes. And it is really your decision. You are absolutely right.
Yes.
"- that no one has the right to tell you what to do. Er, can I ask you? If you did - er, if there was a situation where you would decide, ""I have to stop"" - what would it be?"
"Hard to say, because I already had open heart surgery."
Mm-hmm.
"Prostate cancer, it didn't work."
Correct.
I don't know. I really don't know. I just don't really want it.
Mm-hmm.
I judge -
So that's something you -
""
-pretty much see yourself doing for -
"Yes, for a while, for quite a while. Yes."
"Yes. Okay. Well, I appreciate very much that you are willing to even talk about it. And I understand that now, that's not something you want to pursue. Would it be okay if I brought it up on our next visit? ""Because I know that you said you didn't want to talk, but on the other hand, I'm worried."
"Okay, yes. I could do that. I-me, er, I'm always open to anybody - you know, to listen. Yes."
As long as I don't talk too much?
Yes. [laughs]
Okay. [giggles]
"[incomprehensible 00: 03: 34] I had some options - I just had my surgeon say, ""You - you"" - like, ""Why do I keep you as a patient in the first place?"""
Hmm.
But he's good. [laughs]
[giggles] Are you happy to keep him as a doctor?
Yes.
"Yes. Well, and, David, honestly, wherever you are, we will work with it."
Okay.
"Um, and so many thanks for - thank you for taking a few minutes to talk about smoking."
"Thanks, doc."
Okay.
Okay.
"Jean, it's nice to see you again."
"Hello, doctor."
So what was different from the last time we spoke a week ago?
"Well, I did what we discussed."
Okay.
"- for a week, erm, I tried to record the difference in my smoking, I was more aware when I had the urge to see if I could stop the urge -"
""
"- and I thought it was fine. It got a bit scary at the weekend because, uh, uh, the urge kept on growing."
Sure.
-to have a cigarette.
Sure.
"But during the week I was able to cut down on at least two or three cigarettes a week, and only in one week."
"So you managed to smoke two or three cigarettes less? That's amazing. I mean, considering how much you smoked."
Yes.
"So you could keep that, er, diary?"
Yes.
"Sounds like you did, and that allowed you to really focus on the time [incomprehensible 00: 00: 57] to delay your cigarettes, so that went well. So, what are the things that are not going as well as you would have liked?"
It just seemed to get worse than it was at the weekend.
Correct.
- and I went out with friends and was at home all day -
Yes.
"- instead of at work. And I found that, um, it was really hard to stop these urges."
"Okay. So these automatic cigarettes, when you meet up and have time, are really the problems you face."
Yes.
"-er, and that you noticed that they are more difficult than the others?"
"But I did mark it in the book. Er, that's one thing I told myself, I'll be honest about my mark."
"By writing it off, okay."
"So, I really need to pay attention to the weekends, maybe have some kind of hobby or join a group or something on the weekends to keep me on my toes."
"Okay. So, and you have already thought about what you could do, such as finding a hobby."
If I can just put it off
Okay.
"- and say: ""Okay, I won't have it at home."""
Correct.
'I'll have it when I get to work or on my way to work. '
Correct.
"""Because I-I-I-"
Sure.
"And then, uh-uh, I want to try not to smoke in my house."
"Okay. So, from now until the next time you come back and see me, what do you want to work on?"
I think I just want to do what I did in that first week. I liked the idea of writing it down.
"Okay, so you can move on."
"I--And it took a week and I have two cigarettes a day, I-I figure."
Sure.
"What I would like to do is maybe go down to five cigarettes, in other words another three a day."
Okay.
"And, er, ""because I smoke a big pack and a small pack, maybe just two small packs."
They said five cigarettes this time.
Yes.
And what can you do specifically to achieve this?
I can try to count every day.
Correct.
"And I will still try if I have the urge to let it go, fight it and maybe not go on a cigarette until the next urge comes."
Correct. [incomprehensible 00: 02: 58]
So when I [incomprehensible 00: 02: 59] between two of them
Sure.
"- and to come back and talk to you again and again really helps, ""because I have someone I can talk to."""
Sure.
-Discuss it with us.
"So, given what you are trying to do, when would it be good for you to come back and talk about it?"
"I wouldn't mind coming back in a week because it's all new and a week, I can handle a week."
Absolutely.
"Okay, thanks doctor."
"Well, see you in a week."
"Yes, thank you."
"Hey, can I help you?"
"Yeah, I hope so. Um, my workplace just got smoke-free. I-am-not-very-happy about it. I'm going to keep smoking, but I wonder if there's anything that can help me get through the day. It's like, you know, getting my beer after work and smoking cigarettes."
"So your workplaces have become smoke-free and you're not too happy, are you?"
"No. I'm not going to quit smoking. I mean, I like it. It helps me relax."
Okay. Tell me a little bit about how smoking fits into your day. It helps with -
"I mean, I smoke a little less than a pack a day. It's not that bad. Um, I've probably smoked for the last five years, but I-I-mean, I could quit if I wanted to, but I don't really want it now."
"Okay. So you feel that smoking is a pretty important part of your life right now. It's not something you want to change, but when the time comes for you to decide to quit, you feel pretty confident that you can do it."
"Sure, I can stop."
Okay. What makes you so confident?
"Well, I mean, I don't understand why I couldn't, I've never tried to quit, but it's just something I do for fun, you know, during breaks at work, in the morning and after work."
"Mm-hmm. And so as for the, er, er, willingness to actually go on and try to resign, where do you think you fall on the scale of 1 to 10, where you are, I don't think about it at all, and 10 is, I'm definitely ready, I want to quit."
"I'm probably two. I haven't even thought about quitting, and until this great announcement at work today, I won't give up smoking at all."
Okay. What made you say two instead of one?
"Well, I mean, anything is possible. I mean, I think I might be persuaded. Yes. Is there anything - I mean, are there things I can try that would make me want to quit smoking?"
"Well, there are now a lot of products that can actually help you curb that urge to smoke. We have products that can help replace nicotine, which can help reduce withdrawal symptoms that you might experience when you quit or break down, and also some medications that your doctor might prescribe to you that might even take away some of your cravings after smoking."
"Okay. Well, that's good information. I mean, I'm not going to do anything today. I just need to know my options, but that's encouraging. If I quit smoking, at least I have tools to help me."
"Sure. And back to the scale you mentioned, you said you were a two. What do you think does it take to get you to a four or five?"
"I don't know. I guess if my friends, like if one of my friends decided to quit with me, that would probably help too, but I -- all my friends love to smoke, so I don't see that happening in the near future."
Sure. I wonder if there will be some people planning to quit now that your workplace is smoke-free.
That's a good point. I hadn't really thought about it. That's a good idea. Yes.
"Okay. Well, it sounds like you are here today for informational purposes only. I will be happy to help you choose some of these products if you decide that the time is right for you."
"Okay. Well, thank you very much."
"So, what brings you here, Bob? What is, what can I do to help?"
"Yes. Yes, well, the only reason I'm here is ""because my wife thinks I have a problem with smoking. I've smoked my whole life and, er, six months ago, uh, she thought she got that health kick, right? And now everyone who smokes is evil. And, er, that's why I'm here, just to please her, to get her off my back and -"
"So you are not too happy to be here, that is the last thing you want to do this afternoon."
"Yes. That's an understatement. I mean, I'm supposed to be at work, right?"
"You have taken some time off, it costs you time and money to be here."
"Yes, yes. I'm only here because my wife forced me to come, you know. So it took me six months just to torment me, relentlessly every day, because she could stop smoking, and now I have to stop."
"So let me ask you, Bob, what are some of your wife's concerns about smoking?"
"Well, she is worried about my health and is cutting all these articles from the newspaper about passive smoking and -"
"Wow, she showed you that and made you read."
"Yes, I have to read that. That's my order to read for breakfast and I want to get out and have - we used to go to the table together and have a cigarette. Now, in this weather, I have to go outside, you know, what's the point? And she used to smoke more than I do, and now she's holier than thou?"
It is quite outrageous that you are forced to change your whole life because of a decision she made six months ago.
"And she has set my children against me, you know, my son and my daughter, they are as if they were conspiring against me, you know what I mean?"
So do you see any consequences for your smoking?
"Like my father at 85, he still smokes. I mean, yes, you know, sometimes I thought about quitting, but I mean, I don't know. I don't know if I can - I don't know if I can quit."
"So let me make sure that I understand the way the whole scenario works, because there is a lot of piecemeal stuff behind it. Your wife is in your case and your children are doing the same thing. So, you are kind of isolated, you are pushed into a corner and you are told that you have to do that, you have no choice in the matter."
Yes.
"You worry a bit about your health, but that's not really the driving force. It sounds like it would be nice, above all, if things were just the way they were before she stopped smoking, and that all this stuff wasn't something you had to deal with anymore."
"Yes. Yes. I am only, I do not want to lose her or my family because of smoking."
"I feel like your relationship is really important to you, that you would do anything."
"Well, yeah, I mean, we've been married for over 25 years, and erm, we've never had any major problems before. That's the way it is - that's the first problem. I don't even really see it as a problem because we both smoked and I tried to accommodate them by smoking outside, but it feels like that's how we feel and I'm just worried that it's going to continue like that, like that."
"It strikes me that the way we talk about it is all or nothing. Either you carry on smoking as you are, it goes downhill and it gets worse, the woman gets more and more fixated on the suitcase, or you put down the cigarettes the moment you walk out the door tonight and never take them up again. It's almost like one or the other. It seems to me that there could be a middle ground here, that it took a long time to learn how to become a smoker, and maybe it will take some time to learn to quit smoking."
So can I actually do it like a gradual sabre rattling?
There are some medications and different approaches that we can use that are not so abrupt. Recognizing that it takes some time and practice to get to where you want to be.
"I wish my wife could have come today because she feels like just stopping, so do you think she could come with me on a future appointment or something and she could hear this message?"
"If you wanted to bring your wife, I would be very happy to talk to both of you."
"Okay. I will have to talk to her as well because her schedule changes from week to week, she works shifts, so I'll call you back tomorrow and we'll set up something."
"Okay, that sounds good."
All right.
Thank you for coming.
"Okay, thank you."
"Hi Carrie, thank you for coming in today."
"Thank you, my doctor [incomprehensible 00: 00: 05]"
What brings you into play?
"Well, I have, umm - I have an ongoing problem with smoking and trying to quit smoking."
So would you like to give up those cigarettes?
"Oh, I've wanted that for a long time."
"Yeah, then it's like, uh, now, uh, tell me a little bit about, uh, right now at this point in your life, why it's so important to stop."
"Well, I have a 15-year-old daughter and she is strongly against it. And, er, health problems, you know, I'm not getting younger and I have asthma and I have chronic bronchitis and, er, I have difficulty breathing when I exercise and not to mention that it's not socially acceptable."
It's like being a leper in a leprosy colony to be a smoker.
"In fact, it is like being a leper in a non-leper colony."
"""Because you can't find a leper colony anymore. So, erm, so it's really important that you're a good mummy."
Correct.
"and model for your daughter, who is at that age where 15 would be a really normal age at which she could decide to smoke."
"Right and, um, she said, you know, she comes in and she's like shhh and it's embarrassing for her friends and, um, and that's embarrassing for me."
"Okay. So, you-you-want to look good, you know, and she's proud of you, I'm sure, and that would just be an added advantage. Yes."
"Right, yes."
"So, and then you mentioned a whole lot about medical problems. So, erm, you mentioned, erm, asthma, erm, acute bronchitis you said -"
"Oh and emphysema, the early stages of emphysema."
"Oh my goodness. Okay. And so, and that - yes, that's all - these are really scary beginnings of emphysema, I'm sorry to hear that."
Thank you very much.
"Well, I mean, that's it - that's, you know, tell me when you were diagnosed with it."
"I really couldn't say, uh, I remember when my daughter was five, uh, I was - it was damp outside and I have a problem with damp."
Mm-hmm.
"-You know, to breathe, er, and, er, I tried to stick my head out the window to gasping for air."
Mm-hmm.
"- and my daughter became so scared that she went to our neighbor and called 911, and it was really -"
Smart girl.
"Yes-Yes, she's very intelligent, yes. Um, and they came and took me, you know, on that chair in my coat and my daughter was panicking, uh, she thought she was going to lose me and she's 15, so 10 years have passed since then and I've got this Chantix."
Mm-hmm.
"-unsuccessful, uh, --"
Tell me a little bit about what happened to the Chantix.
"Well, erm, I don't know if it's my lack of willpower, but, erm, it also had very bad side effects."
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Wh-What a kind of if-if-if you're willing to talk about what kind of side effect -
"Er, I had nightmares."
Mm-hmm.
-nausea
Mm-hmm.
"-um, stomach problems and restlessness. Yes."
"Oh really. You know, and I heard that, Carrie, that people you know especially are, um, some people seem to have a lot of success, but when people have the negative side effects, they are really as pronounced as the ones you just described."
"Right, and it didn't stop me from smoking, so that's, uh, [laughs] -"
Do the good guys not want good? And how long ago was it that you -
"Er, that was two or three years ago."
"Okay, all right."
I've tried it a few times.
Okay.
"I'd get a, er, new recipe and think, ""Oh, I could try this time."""
Mm-hmm.
And I had friends for whom it worked.
Mm-hmm.
"Um, and there's a support group they have that you can go online or call."
Okay.
- but of course I did not -
Mm-hmm.
""
It just didn't suit you to do that online.
"No, yes."
"Okay. Um, but you tried it and it just didn't fit you like you - you really listened to what your body was telling you, like nightmares, nausea, I mean, these are really bad things."
And agitation really -
Oh yes.
"- because, uh, you know, uh, at my age I'm going through the menopause, which is part of it, you know, you're going to have that anyway and then you're going to have a 15-year-old who's going to be a little bit more stressed, so you don't need any extra stress, I don't think as far as I'm concerned."
"So, it's already accumulated, I'm thinking for you, you don't need anything else, so you're looking for some relief, not something that makes you feel worse."
Correct.
"Er, have there ever been times in the past when you could quit smoking completely?"
Only when I was in hospital. [giggles]
Okay.
"And even then I sneaked out and had a cigarette, you know."
"Okay. So what is the longest time you have ever gone without a cigarette, including hospitalization?"
"Oh God, I'd have to say, uh, three days."
"Oh, three days. You know, that's a long time and I felt like that's a pretty long time to be without smoking, and I could imagine I think that's pretty good."
"But it wasn't really voluntary, it was because of, um, the situation I was in, I couldn't smoke, yeah."
They were forced to
Correct.
-Do not smoke?
Mm-hmm.
What did you notice during those three days when you didn't smoke?
"Um, constant thoughts of smoking."
Mm-hmm.
"Er, er, just like, er, a chocolate lover yearns for chocolate."
""
-I longed for my cigarette.
They were [incomprehensible 00: 06: 04]
"Yes, exactly. Mm-hmm. Yes. Um, and the first thing I could smoke, I didn't care if I was smoking my brand or any other brand, I just wanted that cigarette."
Okay.
Nicotine is addiction.
Correct.
"And - and also the thing with the psyche, you know - I mean, I wake up in the morning, I want a coffee with - I want coffee with a cigarette."
Mm-hmm.
"Um, when I'm stressed, coffee with cigarette."
Mm-hmm.
"I mean, just cigarette. Um, so it's always the way it is - it's a duel, a kind of problem that I imagine."
Mm-hmm.
-You know -
""
-I think it is.
"It does, er, it does a lot of positive things for you."
Mm-hmm.
"And it sounds like it's paired, like coffee and cigarette. I mean, you know, probably hard to think, ""How am I going to have a cup of coffee without a cigarette?"""
Mm-hmm.
"And, you know, and, um, that's actually, yeah, that's a--I think it gets very mixed up with a lot of different things. And, um, you know that maybe, and let me know when you do it, um, because of the way you describe it and exactly is -- it's really what we call an almost perfect drug in many ways."
"Oh, really?"
-it will do whatever you need to do it at any given time 。 The downside is-is-it somehow gets it; it will end up with health 。
"Oh, yes."
It will usually take a good 10 years before you have reached the minimum of your life.
"As they say, my aunt was like, ""Put another nail in your coffin,"" you know."
Okay. What do you think when she tells you?
"More of a cocky sort of thing and I say, ""Well, you know, Aunt Kathy, you were my role model, and back then I envied and saw you and thought you were so sexy, and all the movies, the old movies."""
Glamorous.
"Yes, yes. And that's what I was associated with then, and now it's almost, I'm ostracized for it."
Mm-hmm.
So it's kind of a double-edged sword.
"So, and I would - it really is because it wasn't 20 years ago."
""
It certainly wasn't 30 years ago.
Mm-hmm.
"So it has become more difficult to be a smoker, you light a cigarette and people make assumptions about you."
"Oh, yes, and you have to travel like 10 miles."
Mm-hmm.
"- to have a cigarette. And, do not say that you are in a situation and only have a 15-minute break."
Mm-hmm.
"- You can't even finish smoking your cigarette, erm, because you have to be back within a certain amount of time and it takes, say, seven minutes to get to the place where you can smoke and seven minutes to get back."
""
"- and a cigarette, erm, for me smoking takes five minutes."
"Okay, okay."
"A lot of people have told me, erm, if I quit smoking, I put on weight."
""
"Well, food really doesn't taste good, but they say it tastes much better."
Mm-hmm.
-if you quit smoking.
Mm-hmm.
Now the downside is that I'm going to put on weight.
Mm-hmm.
"That means a new wardrobe, which I would like to have, but I can't afford it."
Okay. So at the moment you see it's a part of your life. It's been a part of your life for 18 years.
Mm-hmm.
It has become a more important part of your life because sometimes you find yourself smoking something you thought I would never smoke.
Correct.
"Yes. And your worry is that when you stop, you will end up gaining weight. So I hear this kind of list of things that don't feel so positive when you stop."
Mm-hmm.
I wonder what else might be on that list.
"Er, retreat."
""
"They say it's terrible. Um, being cranky."
Mm-hmm.
"And when I go through this, I just hope that my friends understand and support me in what I'm trying to do."
"Mm-hmm. Okay. Yes. So on top of the other list, there is the obligation to go through withdrawal."
Mm-hmm.
- the unpleasant thing about it. Okay. What else could be on the not so good side of smoking - quitting?
"Um, I think it's all on the bad side of smoking, but, um, I've been smoking for so long."
Mm-hmm.
- not - to go through life without smoking.
Mm-hmm.
"I know I have to quit. Er, I don't have any health problems from cigarettes."
Mm-hmm.
"-at the moment, but when the doctor told me this morning what to expect in the future -"
Mm-hmm.
- that made me think
""
-everything.
So thank you for coming today.
Yes.
How are you today?
I actually feel great.
Yes? Good.
Yes.
Fine.
I feel good.
"And so you have made your clarifications,"
Yes.
- And what are your top five?
"Yes. It was a good, er, experience for me. It was different. It was different than usual. There were several things that were different, and erm, the most important value I set was self-esteem. And I don't even know if self-esteem was ever in my top five, let alone number one."
Really?
"Yes. And, um -"
Do you have any idea why this is?
"I think I have a clue why that is. Er, I think a few things have been happening lately, and one thing that I really became aware of when I was visiting with my family is that I've been consistently putting other people first all my life, probably, consistently, and I've consistently, erm, almost not even included myself in the equation. It was kind of sad when I realized it. Er, I didn't know how serious it actually was, but I was kind of glad that I recognized it because I feel like it's never too late to change it."
True.
"- and I feel like I can, er, respect and appreciate myself just as much as other people. I know that's important, and I feel that if I do that, I'm a better person for other people."
Mm-hmm. By not pushing oneself so much into the background?
Yes.
Yes.
"Because I'm stressed, annoyed, overwhelmed and, er, dancing out of line, I think, dancing out of line."
Mm-hmm.
And I can't be the best - the best I can be.
For anyone else?
Yes.
For your family?
"For myself or for someone else, one way or another, yes."
"Do you think it is such a fact that you have pushed yourself into the background, that you have neglected yourself, or that you have put others in front of you so much that you have not even thought about yourself?"
"I think that some people might not even think that I would put it first, but in my mind and emotions I was concerned about what other people think, and I let that worry dictate my actions. Instead of letting my own values dictate what I thought other people wanted me to dictate my actions."
Wow.
"And I've been doing this for so long, literally since I was a kid, that I didn't even know I was doing it."
There is so much of you - part of your paradigm?
"Yes, yes."
So do you think you were sometimes unaware of this?
"I felt like I had this aha moment where I realized that I could be my own parents, and now I could give myself the things that I wasn't given. I can give myself a voice. I can give myself an opinion. I can live like this when I want to. No one is stopping me from doing it, only me."
Yes.
So that's what I want to do.
Mm-hmm.And it's the first time in my life that I don't feel guilty for saying that.
The very first time you can remember?
"I would say that, yes. I don't know if I ever said that in front of people and didn't feel the slightest whiff of guilt for it. [giggles]"
This is not a selfish thing.
No.
Correct.
"- it is not, it really is not."
"Cool, that's great."
Yes.
"Yes. And so you had the feeling that you had come to this change, and - and - how do you feel about it?"
"It makes me feel like I count, like I'm important. Er, it makes me feel like I can do what I want to do with more joy and more passion and less fear and responsibility, because one of the things that happened along the way that I really didn't notice is that I like to be a teacher, say, or be a teacher or a counselor to some extent, but because of all the shoulders and the sense of responsibility and all the concern for what people think, I started to lose the joy of things that I actually enjoy."
Because you felt so committed.
"My passion has completely disappeared. I don't know if I just like doing it, I feel like I've come back into contact with myself. It's like I've been lost for a while and now I'm back, yes, now I remember why I wanted to do it or why it's important to me because it's actually one of my values to be and help, but it just has to be, er, balanced."
"Yes, is that one of your top five?"
"No, but erm, the others I have there, erm, are number two, inner harmony. For the same reason as I feel that I have to harmonize within myself before I can be harmonious with others."
Do you get peace with yourself?
"Yes, and then I put family happiness first."
That is very good.
"Yes, because I believe that when I am at peace with myself, er, that automatically contributes to my family happiness. If I am dissatisfied with myself, I bring my unhappiness to my family."
Sure.
"Er, yes, if I don't have self-respect and just give my family a say over who I am and what I should do, I'm angry with them, I'm arguing with them."
One is resentful.
"I really get annoyed when I'm in mode, but when I just say, ""Hey, I'm a member of this family and I deserve so much time, energy and attention and just more than anyone else,"" I don't care, you do what I do, I do what I do, life goes on [giggles]."
Correct.
"And then I have health and performance, and for me that performance says a sense of achievement, and for me that kind of performance fits with what we were talking about earlier, how I think I can turn up and be a teacher and a counselor in many different, er, skills. I could be you - I could be you - I could be a teacher and I could be a really bad teacher. I could still be a teacher, I could turn up and I could just do a really bad job and I could go home and probably keep my job for a while, it wouldn't be the first time right?"
Correct.
But I don't feel good about it.
You don't feel fulfilled.
No.
As if you had done anything useful.
"Right, right."
s because you show up and give
"It's not enough that I just turn up and pay my paycheck. It doesn't, I don't feel fulfilled, so that's how I see it, along with the helpers. It's not just about helping to look good or to exhaust myself or do what I think I'm doing, but really giving something needy, something substantial, something real."
Sensible.
"Yes, it makes sense, even if it's small."
Sometimes it's the little things that really matter.
Yes.
"So all these things together right now at this point in life feel like it's really a healthy change for you, like where you're at."
"Yes, yes."
"That's great and is there anything else on the list that you felt would match some of the other top five you've had, or something like that?"
"Well, one of the things about this list that kind of surprised me is almost every time I made this list, creativity and freedom were really high up, and it didn't even make the top five. It was in my top 12."
Er-uh.
"But I think the conclusion I've come to is that if I have inner peace and self-esteem, I can be more creative and have more freedom. Part of everything that binds me, part of everything that takes away my freedom, is if I just explain everywhere and don't pay attention to myself. Part of everything that steals my creativity is when I am - my mind is reeling in stress and I'm not - I can't even hear myself. I can't even hear myself think. How can you be creative when you can't even hear yourself?"
All the chatter.
"Yes, exactly, for me, creativity comes from silence, comes from silence. It's literally -- I can just be quiet, if only for a few moments. It's amazing what ideas come to me so quickly and so easily that it would take me hours to figure out if I'm stressed."
Thanks for sharing.
"Thank you, thank you for listening."
"Well, I'm here because my mother wants me to be here."
Mm-hmm.
"I don't really want to be here, but it is - whatever."
Understood.
"Er, she's found my hiding place."
Er-huh.
"- and she freaked out, and she's crazy about it. Er, I don't know why she went through something like that in the first place, but whatever, now I'm here."
Mm-hmm.
"Um, I've been hanging out with a cool new crowd that I really like."
Mm-hmm.
"Er, a-and-that's it, basically."
"Yes. So - so you have this new group of friends and - and, um, you - you actually kind of want to know where you are with things at the moment, and your mom went through your stuff and found your hiding place, and it just turned into, you know, all of that."
Yes.
Yes.
"Yes, basically."
Yes.
Mm-hmm.
"And, er, does it sound as though you are getting quite upset about your mother for doing this?"
I am.
Yes.
"I mean, it's my stuff, I don't know why she does it -"
"Right. It's like your private place and, you know, it's - that's - it's your stuff."
I-I-don't-go-through-it-I-don't-go-through-their-stuff-I-don't-go-through-their-wallets.
"Yes, so why should she go through yours?"
Correct.
Yes.
The baby had been up all night and I was exhausted.
So what you're saying is that you've had a tough night?
"Yes. She got up every three hours to eat, I don't understand."
So she had to eat every three hours last night and that was really frustrating for you?
"Yes. My mother told me that I started sleeping when I was one month old, Lilly is six weeks old."
"Hmm. So, based on what your mother told you, are you waiting for Lilly to sleep through the night at this point?"
"Well, what is normal for a baby at that age?"
Hello.
"Hi Deborah, how are you today?"
"Well, I'm doing really well."
"Yes, erm, so you made your Value Statement Sheet. Is there anything you want to talk about that you have discovered?"
"Yes, I really enjoy doing that and, um, I've made health my first choice."
"Oh, so it's your first?"
"- Er, value. Yes, because I really value physical and mental health, er, spiritual, emotional. Everything as a whole, I guess, health. Er, and I'm working on, er, a certification as a fitness trainer. Cal State [inaudible 00: 00: 40] there's a similar extension program. I've been doing this for five weeks. I've got a final exam in front of me, like Saturday. A little tense, I guess, but, er, I'm looking forward to doing it, like, and I have to wait for my results. Then I went to an internship."
Mm-hmm.
"Um, but it's kind of exciting, a different career path in my life. Being an office worker for so long also gets boring - physical activity, health, in that respect."
"So health is your number one, um, what is driving you in this new direction, as far as you are a former civil servant? You are doing something that you actually live for."
"Yeah, I like to be active. You know, if I could be, um, better at tennis, and I'd like to do something like that to teach people how to play tennis, but I don't. I know enough about the game and play it, but I-I don't think my skill level would be high enough to actually coach other people, but -"
Have you done this more than once?
"Yes, I have."
And has health always been number one for you?
"I don't know if it was always number one. Probably it was definitely number three. Er, yes, because I had problems, er, with inner harmony, I guess, at different stages of my life, so I don't get that. This time I put it in second place."
Inner harmony is number two?
"Yes, it's just weird how it came out that it wasn't in the top 12, but when I look back, it had something to do with, er, peace, er, inner peace or something."
Mm-hmm.
"And, um, I've put that as a higher priority or at the top of my value list."
"So would you like to say more about that part of inner harmony, how it affects your life?"
"Yes. Um, since I started practicing yoga, and since I started teaching yoga, I have come to terms with the fact that I feel like I have a lot more inner harmony. I am more at ease with myself, in the quiet time, and when I meditate."
Mm-hmm.
"Um, I really feel like - yeah, I feel really good about myself."
"So if yoga is based on number two, how does inner harmony come from?"
"Yes, that's part of it. Yes, and then I just feel like, uh, I don't have to do it right for other people. It's not a selfish thing to put myself first. And, uh, that's something I've always tried to make other people happy, to please other people and to put myself second, third, fourth or whatever, and I always thought, ""Well, that's how a good person should be."" I think that's okay if you do something now and then, and then there are times for that, you know. There's something going on, and you want to do everything to help people, and you say, ""Well, my needs aren't that important right now."" I think that's okay to do it now and then. As long as you know - you don't really, uh, yourself."
Mm-hmm.
"Not out of the feeling, er, you know, ""I'm committed to this person."""
"Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it was basically a problem to think about how you felt before when you were second, third and fourth. Um, it was really a problem, you know, how you could be like that, you know, selfish and think about yourself when you're like that."
Mm-hmm.
"- the reality is inner peace and inner harmony is based on self-esteem, and you know how to deal with yourself - and with it -"
Self-love.
Self-love.
"Yes, mm-hmm, yes. [Crosstalk] And that it is not selfish."
"Yes, it's not selfish, so you feel like you can help, you can help others, erm, as long as it doesn't hurt you. It's true."
"Yes. Yes. Um, then, but also the service, that's the third thing, because I really like helping other people. To be there for other people, you know, and - and if it turns me off. Just like I have my brother, his daughter and his granddaughter, they come over and, er, I slept on the air mattress and, er, me with my mom and dad and my siblings -- mine -- his daughter in the other spare room that I have."
Mm-hmm.
"And I do, but I think it's one night or it's two nights where I have a guest. I could sleep in my bed all the other days. [incomprehensible 00: 05: 54]"
"So, you know, even if I'm a little uncomfortable, my house gets messy, my kitchen is a mess, or everything they don't get behind is fine. You know, I'm going to live. You know, it's okay, it's not a big deal. Yes. It used to be wisdom because I really, umm - it's at the top of my list and it could be even higher if these other things weren't there."
"But I like it when I learn and experience different cultures that go to different places in the world, erm, and then I'm just around people that live in a community that comes from different cultures, and I think that brings a lot of wisdom, and just being open to, erm, differences, and then like today, on election day, when I realize that something could happen, erm, in Congress or the Senate, that's going to be kind of against my values, but when it happens, it happens, and I have to deal with it and - and be at peace with everything that others do - I still have that inner peace within me."
"And in the sense that you say in your words, you will live."
Right. Mm-hmm.
"So, live, erm, I have that as a priority, erm, I feel like you, as you said before you live, but you know you're able to look at those values, okay, those are my values, you know, and you're able to recognize [incomprehensible 00: 07: 30] values."
Yes.
And knowing the differences of different cultures brings you wisdom.
"Yes. And learning at school in the classroom and outside the classroom. Where I've been in various Indian communities, reservations, I've really spent two months in the summer, erm, learning about the cultures is a beautiful place, there's a lot of wisdom. And, erm, fun, pleasure, fun, satisfaction."
Mm-hmm.
"It's fun to learn about other people, other cultures. It's fun to have inner harmony. I think that - I think that was an all-encompassing thing in life. Part of it is experiencing joy. Yes."
So pleasure as your number five.
Yes.
Okay.
"And when I think about the flip side of it, er, er, I know there's going to be pain, disappointment, upset in my life, er, also that I accept that and that's part of the joy."
Mm-hmm.
True joy arises when you know that it will not always be happy.
Mm-hmm.
"I'm going to be disappointed, I'm going to get hurt or whatever."
So you have taken into account that
Absolutely.
Things can happen in life.
Mm-hmm.
It sounds as if your list is definitely a story. I-It kind of pulls you as far as your health in the beginning and number two was the service. Number three. Er -
Inner harmony.
"Inner harmony was number two, and to have that peace of that time, to allow yourself to help other people or serve the service."
Correct.
"This being, er, insofar as, as you said in yourself, you will not be able to find problems with helping other people. And, er, then there is the service that is your number three or number four, which has been wisdom. You learn other cultures, you know, and you have this broad spectrum - just opening your eyes and seeing the world in a completely different realm. And then five, which is pleasure, which is okay, I see the whole world and I know within myself that I am able to accept that things will come out of me as far as, you know, not being, you know, er, it's like, okay, things can happen. One day you will be confused, but find joy and pieces [incomprehensible 00: 10: 21]"
Yes.
"Well, it was nice to talk to you."
"Yes, it was nice to be here and listen to me. Encouraging me was okay."
Okay.
