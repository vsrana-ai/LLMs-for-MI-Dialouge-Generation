"Molly, thank you so much for coming over and yakking with me today. I love you so much"
You're welcome.
"Yeah, I appreciate that. Uh, your mom gave me a call and said that, um, some of your problems at school and being mean and things like that, and"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Just got home 2 times already from school just bc of bullying and everything
"Thats a- that's a lot of school to, yeah, and, yall know--"
And as I was getting out of school like more rumours started to pop as I was getting out of school. me coming back and like these rumours about me. I was in the principal's office the whole day and had security guards like escort me to classes which that was not true 'cause
People like to make up stories.
Ive been getting blamed ever since like fifth or sixth grade about with every single thing that goes on
"For, like why do you think, wh-wh-what types of-"
"I'm thinking because the kids--'cause I like to nag on things. I like to like talk more like with the person instead of just leaving it be, and I think the kids that like blame me for"
"So this is, uh, so when you were talking about like nagging on, tell me a bit more about, can you give me an example?"
"If somebody says like, ""Oh, I heard this thing about you"". I'm going, ""Oh, really, what is this,"" and I just keep talking and like make things worse. I like go on, and say like, ""Okay, then hit me up, and say like, 'Okay, then hit me up.'. I like stayin there & like talkin more."
"And-and what happens when you dont leave it be, what usually happens?"
"I'm thinking maybe more like talking more like it gets more like it gets bigger and bigger. It's just like if you stop it then they don't know what to say, they-they-they-they-. And like that stops everything but like if I talk it-it keeps building up and we both get in trouble-"
okay. ok. ok.
-and like called down to the principal's office.
okay. ok. ok.
-and get talked to.
"Okay so and then what-is it like to get spanked in the principal's office after that, once you get sp"
"Well, usually I try telling myself to just like, leave it be-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"But if somebody say something about me, it gets me mad 'cause like what the heck, like you talkin' about me so. I think Im trying to get like better now"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"I just said like, ""Oh wow this is so lame, like I just want to leave,"" and I like let the conversation"
Thats pretty cool that you did that
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I've felt proud of myself.
"You should be proud of yourself, and how did you do that?"
"I just thought about it like when I like I say like stuff back, mom gets real mad at me, she like, ""Well, I can help you no more."". 'Cause she tells me to like leave it be but I really don't lis-listen to her so she gets mad. So I tried like thinking of her feelings and like what would happen if I said, ""This is lame, leave me alone,"" 'cause then they'll"
"Uh, that says a lot about you and your mom's relationship tho that you can kind of put yourself in her head and think ab"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"You know what I mean. Pretty cool, not everybody can do that so. So you could kinda put yourself ahead, uh, it's almost like watching a movie ahead-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-and knowing how it turns out.
"'Cause usually, if I get in trouble, mom gives me the silent treatment that I don't like. I feel like she's not talking to me, I feel like trying to talk to her, she don't like wheezing being like,"
"Thats the worst, the silent treatment."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Um, so, where you just let it go, you thought about your mom, you like what we would call like, you channeled to"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Is this correct?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Does this--
"I was like, creepy. And their 8th graders that like didnt even go to my old school like I dont even know how they said"
"Yeah, so- and so when you- when somebody else told you that they or people said you that you"
"Well, they dont really say that to me like I just like think that 'cause that's what I hear from my mom, and people"
okay. ok. ok.
-so they keep coming back at me
"Okay, so they-they kinda know how to hook you up."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
-and reel you in-
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"-right, and get you upset. And then bad things happen and then you get in trouble."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [chuckles] That happens a lot.
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah. And it is, uh, so, uh, so you-know that when you channel your mom that helps. Almost sounds like youve been teaching yourself. Like there is-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-a conversation inside. What other ideas do you have for what you could do?
"me thinking about like, um, if I look like at school like peeps are happening during class-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"-I'm just saying, can I use the washroom or something to walk and like think of like how to. And one time during my gym class, there was this girl that I had her like not talking early. And we are playing pickleball idk if yall know that, its like a-"
Pickleball is so weird. I dont know what it is.
"-this is how badminton looks like, big life-size ping pong balls."
This looks like a pickleball?
"Yea, you have like a huge bracket gulf"
There's no pickle?
No. No no no no no
okay. ok. ok.
Nah [chuckles] there's no pick.
Wanted to pickle and stuff.
"Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. And like I was suppose to be turning again. My-- I was in my room like silently and said I can't be by this person, can I move to the next court. So he like switched us around so I wont be by her. And this like happened."
Thats a really good decision
The girls like what the heck like
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Nah but how smart on your part to know that if you would- if you would have to play with her, something bad would"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like I would love smacked her in the face or some- [laughs]
You've been knew that.
-or something.
Right? Right? Right. You've been knew that. So-
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
So you know actually which kids-
"Yeah, that's likephalous"
-know how to push your buttons that real you in.
"Yeah, there are like 4 main ones but not that like I can say who"
"Thats okay. Thats-- Yeah, 'cause it doesnt matter. The important thing is for you to be happy. And, uh--"
"And the friends that I have like I know are my true friends, They be like ones that aint really"
Uh-huh. Uhhhh.
"I mean, they might but like they aint bad and actually like help me. Like some of these girls that like so-called boyfriends like-"
Uh-huh. Uhhhh.
"-They be like they come to me saying like, ""Oh, did you really have to like punch this girl"". I be like, ""No."". Its like you aint a friend if you would actually believe that, you know what I mean?"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Yeah, its kinda annoying cuz it kinda hard like going into high school and like knowing how to believe and who not"
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's--that--that--that's-it-that-that-that-that-. Pressure High School class is probably 1,000 kids."
"Yeah, 1,003."
"1,003 kids."
"Also the sophomores also that you have like another 1,000, so it's likephalic ratio"
2k-
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"-potential enemies, friends, who knows which ones."
"Yeah, with these like the first rumours started going around about like my man and I, and like I lost him just 'c. It be like, wtf. I was like I couldnt get over him for like gosh, who knows, it was like 3 months and I finally"
That must have been hard for you
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"I was like really, you're probably just jealous 'cause I was friends with him or something"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. So but finally after 3 months time flies by-
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-and you got--
Just found out like other people and just forgot about it
okay. ok. ok. So how else do you identify who your real friends are that you can truly trust who got your back?
I say the ones that like not even that Ive known the longest but like the ones that actually hang out with me a lot. And the ones that are actually like this help you before with like situations. And that they tell you stuff and know they can trust you. Like one of my friends tells me everything about her. And like that's how I know she's a good friend 'cause she trusts me with things
You're trusting her back then?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"okay. ok. ok. Well, that makes a lot of sense that people-- it goes both ways."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"You know. You know. And, um-- So and for you, friends that, um, kind of, give you the attention that you would like to have. Texting you-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"-calls and hanging out with you, and stuff like that, rather than pretending to be a friend-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
-when you know maybe they--
"Yeah, that happens a lot with me with like a lot of my friends. Like this one person like we were friends since like-- Well, we were friends since fourth grade."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"And like she just starts like lying and like just talking smack about me. And it be like, you aint a good friend then. Since you were my friend since our 4th grade, like I thought you were a friend"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"And she just cause a lot of drama now. Like the friends I met at high school, she came in like, you don't know who to follow 'cause--. kinda annoying 'cause they're my friends and like I can't be by her and she comes to my friends. It looks like-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"-get your own friends, [chuckles] stop following me."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. Wh-what are you not liking about her?
I just lie a lot and like just starts drama about me and I havent even talked to her since 8 grade. I think we only went to school together and she just like makes me lose other friends 'cause of the drama she starts
"okay. ok. ok. So sounds like she is, um,"
A nobody. A nobody. I will say that. She look like dopamine deficiency
Or-or not worth your time.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
She aint worth your time. So what would it be like to really just spend time with the people that you know are really--
I'm spending time with them. I hang out with them a lot like I do.
Good. Good. Good. Good. That's so good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And if-if you need like some extra support from them--
Ask for it. Im begging you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Right, and what kind of things do you ask from them?"
"I just asked them like if I was like getting like sent down to the principal office for like something, I call them to"
"'Cause they can do that. They can- they can kinda give you some, uh, information like, uh, can give some accurate information, um, and back up your story vs the other person"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"So, okay. So we-- You know what. Um, sounds like you actually have some pretty good ideas about, um, how to handle this, and yet kids are-- I know kids. But, um, i know in high school, i-it was really bad."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"So I'm wondering if, um, uh, if-we could, uh, if-we could, we could get together again and continue to talk '. And I'm very open that if you wanted to bring in any of your good friends that would also be cool too"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
So would that be something--
"Yeah, there's one friend that might wanna like talk abt it"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"And she really is like--she doesnt know, like, who to talk 'cause her mom isnt always there for her"
okay. ok. ok.
And so like she is like doesnt know where to go
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Like she doesnt know who to believe anymore.
"Well, I'd want this session though to be for you though, Molly."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"I mean I'm willing to see her too, you know"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Sounds like she really needs--she would like someone to listen to her.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Couldn't help but talk about some other ways of, um, helping, uh, deal with this because, um, it sounds like,"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And, um, so you'd be willing to come back and talk about it then. okay. ok. ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. I just wanna let you know that I think that you, um, are, in fact, doing a good job of-of, cuz it is hard to"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
This is. It is.
I noticed that.
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And it's hard, and- I think it gets better. My experience was it got a little bit better. Freshman and sophomore year, yall know."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Um, anyway, I think you hang in there beautifully, and I love hearing that you're involved in swimming and some other--"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"[unintelligible 00:13:12] people. So okay, anything else. No? No? No? No. okay. ok. ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
Thank you. You are welcome.
"I was on the phone with you today and you did your values clarification handout, and that was part of what I. Ive been wanting to hear about your values and just talk to you a bit more about that. Do-do you want to tell me what some of your top five values are?"
"Yes, um, my top value is family happiness, um, that's-"
That number one? That one? That one?
"-that number one to me especially now. I usually do this values clarification sheet, like, every 2-3 months-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"-just to see if anything changed, and every time it did change."
"Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. So, family value is the most important thing to you right now?"
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes
Family happiness?
"Yes, it's the most important because it's lacking, so I know that's something that's very"
okay. ok. ok. Would you like to talk more about that?
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I just want to say that my family hasnt been on one accord, so, like, if-- I feel like if we all just. I need to be more present and, um, just hear and understand my family members, and-"
"Mm. the mf. Because even though it may be important to you, maybe they don't know that it's important to you."
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes
"Is this what you mean. Yes? Oh, yeah, yeah"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
And you want them to know?
"And I want them to know how important it is to me, especially now, and I do this, like I said, every 2 to 3 months"
Uh-huh. Uhhhh.
"And, um, these definitely are different from-"
okay. ok. ok.
-what i usually pick.
okay. ok. ok.
"Um, and then the second one I said is religion. Um, it was number one at first, um, but somehow with a big situation that happened in my family you kinda lose sight of your faith a. And a lot of people-- They, uh, just seem to be, ""Oh, you lost touch of God, oh my gosh, you're the devil."""
Uh-huh. Uhhhh.
"You know? You know. And it kinda kinda kinda kinda kinda kinda kinda kinda kinda kinda kinda kinda kinda kinda kinda kinda kinda kinda kinda kinda kinda kinda kinda kinda kinda kinda kinda. And I feel that my faith is still there but it's-- You know, as long as it's still there, that's all that matters."
"Right. Right. Right. So, it really is a must to put family values first right now. And religion is still very important to you, but you feel like maybe you're losing faith a bit?"
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I've lost faith, and so I'm not afraid to say it."
Uh-huh. Uhhhh.
You know? You know. And once you say [unintelligible 00:03:12] people that arent really feeling that chartically
Because you know other people experience that too.
"Yeah, I know that."
"So, you know thats normal."
I'm aware that's normal.
But sometimes it's not something that people talk about. It's something that people
"Yeah, well, it's a cardiovascular factor"
Especially in church.
"Yeah, it's like a shock to them when you say something like that. And like, ""Well, we all go through things where we just don't know, and--"" I still have a bit, I'm not saying that I'm off track,. Im still a bit to go on. And the positive things in my life that I look at and see as, ""Okay, well, I'm not in this situation, so I'm thankful,"""
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"-I would still have faith to keep going on, but sometimes you feel as though, ""Where is God?"""
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
You know? You know.
"Also, it sounds like you're at a place of acceptance about that also."
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes
"Uh, that's cool with you, and you-you-know that it will change because that's been your, uh, experience."
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes
Youve done numerous values clarification handouts and every time theyre different-
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
-so you know that it will change.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
And you accept that?
"Ive accepted that. I was like, ""Whoa,"" I think I focused too much on the first time I did this-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
-then the second time that I did this-- I did 5 total-
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"-but the second time that I did this I was so focused on, ""What did I read about last time?"". You know? You know."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"So, and just went ahead and blanked that out and just went and blanked that out and"
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes
"-compared and I was like, ""Oh wow."""
"I really applaud you for being open minded enough to realize that where you are now is not necessarily where you are, that"
"Mm-hmm, and that's what I felt wasn't-- At first I was like, ""Is this not normal?"". You know? You know."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"But, I notice people go through things everyday. I'm going through things in life. Things are about to change."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Things do not stay the same. You may be here, you may be going over there, your view on life changes the more experience, the more experience, the more"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"-your eyes--well, to me, my eyes have gotten wider, and broad, and broad. Sophalous"
Right. Right. Right.
"I'm not limited to change anymore, I just kind of fill it out, and then [unintelligible 00:05:38] I'm like, ""Okay."""
Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok.
"Thats cool, so I can focus more on that than the unnecessary stuff in my life"
"Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. Do you feel that some parts of your life are where you'd rather be more in line with your values, or do you feel"
"I mean, I was kind of, like, out of place for me, because when I did this one in particular, um, as-as--"
The other 3?
"Um, number three was health."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"inner harmony = number four, and security."
"Inner harmony, health, and security-"
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes
-are the other 3?
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
And the top 2 are family happiness and religion?
And religion.
"Okay, and the 3- the other 3, inner harmony-- Let me see if I can remember them. Inner harmony, health and, what was the other one?"
Insecurity. At. All.
Insecurity. At. All.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Inner harmony. Health. And security.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Do you feel like you don't get as much attention from them as you would want?
"Yeah, because when I saw it I was like, ""Okay, yeah, that's one, that's one, and that's one."""
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
Buttera ratio
Is this because a lot of your time is taken with the first two or?
"A lot of my time is taken with, um, number one especially-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"-and, uh, I've learned about the different way of looking at self-esteem."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
-and I definitely esteem others.
Uh. Thats not true.
"So, I had, um, less time to have inner harmony."
"Oh yeah, right. The family has been so much coming first that you sort of took a backseat?"
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes
You arent even on-- Are you on schedule at all. Meaning of time dedicated. Is most of it going to your family?
Most of it goes to everything else but me.
okay. ok. ok.
"And, uh, like, I'm not even cardiovascular"
It will be hard to achieve inner harmony-
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-if you always running around taking care of everybody.
And inner harmony comes with sleep. I feel that. [laughter] havent been able to sleep lately
Right. Right. Right.
"But, um-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"I think that's the first step, but I just, like-- oh my gosh, I just, like, feel overwhelmed, um, but I'd"
okay. ok. ok.
"-because when I was, you know, 18 I was just so, like, free-spirited, open-minded. Ive been living life, now that I look at it, as a fairy tale."
Mm. the mf. Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"And so I got knocked to the fucking reality and reality said, ""This is not a fairy tale"". Um, you are now on board. Likelihood"
okay. ok. ok.
"And so I felt, ""This isnt about you, you know, this is about everyone else."""
"Mm. the mf. So, something dramatic happened?"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
That fairy tale life-
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
-and into a take care of everyone else thing?
Yeah-
okay. ok. ok.
"-definitely, and the shock just keeps coming"
"okay. ok. ok. I really enjoyed having the time to sit back and talk to you about your values. I hope that this has been helpful to you, and in the future, if I can support even any way in helping some of those other"
Thank you for listening.
okay. ok. ok. Okay? Okay. Okay. Okay. You're welcome.
Mr. Johnson? Mr. Johnson?
Yeah? Oh yeah?
"Uh, I'm here to talk about, uh, your cholesterol and the, um, medicine your doctor prescribed."
"Uh, I've been talking to my doctor about my medicine. Thats his job."
"But, well, it's my job too, to help you understand how to use your medicine and, uh, give you information about"
"Well, to be honest, I don't even know I can take the medicine. I know Ive been high cholesterol, Ive had to get that down but on the other hand, this medicine can cause some severe muscle weakness and. I'm a truck driver and I'm just trying to haul those heavy boxes in on the dollies and I just can't afford that"
"So your-your-doctor told you that if your cholesterol remains elevated, you may have stroke or heart attack?"
"Yeah, down the line but-"
"okay. ok. ok. Well, the side effect is something that is very, very rare, it's not really something you need to worry about, and the risk of stroke"
"Well, right now it's the muscle weakness that-that I'm concerned about, and that's, uh, you know, that's the present,"
"Well, I-I-I understand that. Um but like I said, its very rare. If you feel some muscle weakness, let your doctor know. It's not permanent, okay. Yeah, it wont get to the blood- it wont get to the point where it affects your job Cynthia"
"Well, you know- why cant you just give me the medicine, Ill take it home and think about it. But you know, I'm worried about my work."
"You- you really need to take it down, and-and like I said, the- muscle weakness is rare. Just let your doctor know if you feel muscle weakness. He can take you off or switch. It's not permanent."
Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure. Fine. Fine. Fine. Justphalous
It-it's not permanent.
Whatever. Fuck. It. Is
"Okay? Okay. Okay. Okay. So stroke or heart attack is much worse, make sure you go ahead and pick up your medicine as you walk out and, uh, one-one every day to"
"Oh, yeah, sure. Fine. Fine. Fine."
okay. ok. ok.
Good morning Kaylie. This looks like you are here picking up prescription today
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. My doctor said something in
okay. ok. ok. This looks like cholesterol statin. Do you know how you should take your medication?
"Nah, not really."
"Well, you just take it once a day. Did he say what side effects to expect?"
No. No no no no no
"Well, some common ones are nausea, vomiting, headache. Some severe ones like dermatomyositis, liver failure, lupus, rhabdomyolysis, hemorrhagic cerebral infarction. Just call your doctor if you have any of those"
okay. ok. ok. Um why am I taking this medication
This is for your dyslipidemia. Oh yeah just one tablet a day. Any questions for me?
"Nah, probably not."
Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. Awesome. Great. Have a good day.
Good morning Kaylie. I see you there picking up prescription today
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. My doctor said something in
"Lol, looks like he called in cholesterol statin. Do you know how you should take this medication?"
"Nah, not really."
"okay. ok. ok. Well, you're taking this one once a day. Did he say what side effects to expect?"
No. No no no no no
"Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. Well, some common side effects are nausea, vomiting, headache. Some severe side effects like dermatomyositis, liver failure, lupus, rhabdomyolysis, hemorrhagic, cerebral infar. If you have any of those, you should call your doctor."
"okay. ok. ok. Um, so why am I taking this medication?"
This is for your dyslipidemia. Oh and you should take one every day. Any questions for me?
I guess not.
"Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. Awesome. Great. Well, have a good afternoon."
"Hi Kaylie, I'm Lori, the pharmacist here at Bulldog Pharmacy. I see that you have a new prescription for cholesterol statin 20 called in by Dr. Ferris today. I've been wondering if you've had a moment to talk to me lately. Just want to make sure that you know how best to take it, and if you have any questions."
Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure. I just got myself a few groceries
okay. ok. ok. What did the doctor say to you cholesterol statin is for?
"Well, he told me that I had a blood test for cholesterol, and that I should start taking this."
"He's right. This medicine helps lower your cholesterol, and that means that it will help lower your risk of having heart attacks or a stroke. How did your doctor tell you to take this medicine?"
He didnt really say that. Just phoned it in.
"okay. ok. ok. Well, you can take one tablet of cholesterol statin 20 one time a day by mouth, and you can take that with or without food. When are you normally taking your medications?"
"Well, I'm taking all of my other medications right before I go to bed. So I guess I could get it then"
"okay. ok. ok. Thats perfect because cholesterol statin works best when it's taken at night, though you can take it any time of the day. And you should take it every single day. That's important to keep up. Where do you store your medications?"
"my medications are in my nightstand, uh, right by my bed, so i can store them"
Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. Do you have any children in your home?
No. No no no no no
"okay. ok. ok. Well, then that sounds like a perfect location for you. Medicines keep best when stored away from light and heat and moisture. What did the doctor say to you in terms of side effects?"
He didnt mention that
"Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. Well, this medication is pretty well tolerated, which means it's not very many side effects. But you might experience some mild muscle aches and pains. If they seem severe to you then you should call Dr. Ferris and talk to him about that. Also this medicine can interact with a lot of other medications, and even over the counter things. So check with the doctor or myself before you start anything new. And lastly grapefruit juice can interact with cholesterol statin 20. I probably would switch to a different juice while you on this medication so if you use grapefruit"
"Just so I know we have the same page, can you repeat back to me how you will take this medicine?"
"Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure. I just want to take one tablet right before I go to bed with my other medications. And guess Ive switched to orange juice. And if I notice any muscle pain that is severe, I will call Dr. Ferris right away."
"Great, Kaylie. I know we've been going over a lot today. What other questions would you like me to answer?"
"Uh, I think you answered all my questions. Thank you. You are welcome."
"Fantastic. Fantastic. Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. Well, here's your prescription. I'm even putting this on auto fill so that it fills for you every- at the same time every month. And if you have any other questions later, our phone number is right here on the bottle, and you can call me at anytime. Thanks so much. Have a great day."
"Good morning Kaylie. I'm Lori, the pharmacist here at Bulldog Pharmacy. I see that you have a new medication to pick up today. Called in by Dr. Ferris for cholesterol statin 20. Is there a moment you can talk about. I want to make sure that you know how best to take this medicine and to answer any questions that you may have."
Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure. I just got myself a few groceries
Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. What did the doctor say to you cholesterol statin is for?
I was told that I had a blood test for cholesterol so that I should start taking this medication.
"Well, and he is correct. This medication helps lower your cholesterol, and it helps lower your risk of having a heart attack or a stroke. How did the doctor tell you to take this medicine?"
"I didnt get a call, he just phoned it in."
"Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. Well, you can take one tablet of cholesterol statin 20 one time a day by mouth, and you can take that with or without food. When are you usually taking your medications?"
Me taking all my other medications right before I go to bed. So I guess I could get it then
"That's perfect. This medication can be taken any time of the day but it works best when taken in the evening, and it"
Where do you store your medications?
"I'm a nightstand by my bed, I'm a store. I store them"
Do you have children in your house?
No. No no no no no. I'm not having kids.
"Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. So that sounds like a perfect place to store those. Medications are best when stored away from light, heat and moisture."
What did your doctor say to you in terms of side effects?
He didnt mention that
"Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. Well, this medication is usually well tolerated, which means that it doesn't have very many side effects, but you might. If they seem severe to you then you should call Dr. Ferris and talk to him about that. Also, this medication can interact with over-the-counter drugs or even other medications. You should check with either Dr. Ferris or myself before you start something new. And lastly, grapefruit juice can interact with this medication. So while you taking this medicine, I would avoid grapefruit juice."
"Just so we know we have the same page, can you repeat back to me how you are going to take this medicine?"
"Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure. I just got a cholesterol statin tablet, uh, in the evening with all my other medications. And guess I'll switch to orange juice. And if I notice any bad muscle pains then I'll be sure to call Dr. Ferris right away."
"That's awesome, Kaylie. I know we've been going over a lot today. What questions do you still have for me?"
I think you answered all my questions. Thank you. You are welcome.
"Well, good. Good. Good. Well, here's your prescription. I'm even putting this on autofill so it will be ready at the same time every month for you. And if you have any questions later, our phone number is right here on the bottle, and you can call me at anytime. Thanks so much. Have a great day."
Hi Dr. Martin. I've heard you have a question for me. What did you want to talk about?
"Excuse me, are you the pharmacist. Just had a citalopram question"
"Yeah, I'm the pharmacist on duty. Citalopram, okay. This is an antidepressant and it comes in 10, 20, and 40-milligram strengths. It excretes in the urine and has a half life of about 35 hours. There are sexual side effects, heart side effects, and stomach side effects."
Okay but I just wanted to know if this interacts with phenelzine?
"Lol, um, yeah, I think that should be fine."
"Okay, thanks for that. Got an appointment to run to"
"Well, that's a good thing. Thanks. Call me anytime you want"
"Hi Mrs. Smith. At this appointment, I wanted to let you know that we are giving Lilly some vaccines."
Ooh I-I'm not comfortable with that. Ive been reading a bunch of stuff lately about them
Hmm. Interesting. Can you please share your concerns about vaccines?
"Uh, yeah, I was just- I was just- reading that it's better to let them build up their immunity, like, naturally and stuff in their"
"Okay, so you thought maybe exposing Lily naturally to these diseases would be a better choice than using vaccines to help her"
"Yeah, yeah. Well, yeah. I mean Ive had chickenpox as a kid, and now I have immune system. Right? Right? Right. So. Much. Fucking."
Thats right. Thats it. That. Having chickenpox as a child means you're less likely to get chickenpox as an adult because you've developed a-a. Uh but is it okay if I offer you a bit more information about the other vaccines that we- we- were going to give her Lily
"Uh, okay. Thats okay."
"okay. ok. ok. Uh, before vaccines were developed, often when children had natural exposure to some of these diseases, they ended up with, uh, sometimes death, deaf,. Polio caused, uh, paralysis in children. And so, allowing children to have natural exposure to these diseases, sometimes was a bit of a gamble, it could be dangerous"
"Wow, I didnt realize that was so dangerous. I have never heard of polio."
"Hmm. Interesting. Some of these things I mentioned to you, you-you don't know-. Uh, and I think that's because we've done such a good job of eliminating some of these diseases that a lot of p. Um, so having shared this information with you, what do you think about the idea of vaccines for-for Lilly?"
"Uh, I guess that works. I'm just trying to make her healthy and safe."
Its really important to make sure that she is protected and that you make good decisions and do your research before
"Yeah, just want to do what is right."
"Hi Mrs. Smith, my name is Terri, I am one of the nurses that works with Dr. Fields."
"Oh, you know, I remember you. Yeah, we've met once before."
"Yes, I think when you were in last time."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Dr. Fields talked with you last time about maybe trying a tai chi class to see how that would go, and I wanted to-to check in"
"Well, I've gone once."
Uh-huh. Uhhhh.
"Yeah and um, it was very-very beautiful to see and the instructor was very kind, but I felt self-conscious because I"
Uh-huh. Uhhhh.
"And had to sit in a chair. Couldnt, you know, do what they were doing."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"So, it was--it was--I simply felt self-conscious."
"Uh-huh. Uhhhh. So, you thought it was beautiful and liked the instructor but you were a little self conscious because you were in a chair?"
A lot of self consciousness.
"A lot self conscious, uh huh."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"What were you hoping to achieve with the, um, by going to tai chi?"
"Well, like Dr. Fields told me, it helps with balance, and I still have the wobblies. So, I really wanted to get to the point where I could benefit from what they had to offer. Um, yeah, mostly my own, mostly my own balance."
"Uh-huh. Uhhhh. So, you're hoping that this would help with balance, but you didn't see the- maybe the results you"
Not yet. Not yet.
Not yet. Not yet.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Uh-huh. Uhhhh. What is your overall goal. What are you working towards?
Bitch I wanna go home
Uh-huh. Uhhhh.
"Yes, I'm really doing that."
"Mm-hmm, and what is it that matters to you getting home?"
[sighs] it all. My little dog is so cute I wanna be with him
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
He is so cute and I miss my garden
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"And I just miss being independent, going to bed when I want to sleep and getting up when I want to cook. The independence. The. Love. Sure I miss being independent."
"Uh-huh. Uhhhh. So, you want your dog, your garden, back to your life, your independence?"
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
What do you think you need in order to be able to achieve that goal of getting home?
"Well, they told me that I need to be able to walk down the hallway and back, even with the walker, being secure and"
Uh-huh. Uhhhh.
And still haven't gotten there yet
And do you agree that is what you need to do in order to get home?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Uh-huh. Uhhhh.
I-Im not falling off.
Uh-huh. Uhhhh.
"I-I had friends that had that happen. So, um, I-I agree a little, with some hesitation, but I do agree."
"Uh-huh, and tell me how your physical therapy is going?"
"Oh, it looks better."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
this still hurts. It- it- it- it- it- it- it- it. I-I'm-getting-better. Not quite as painful as it used to be.
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
Oh yeah so-
"So, it sounds like, um, you can see that you're making some physical therapy progress-"
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes
-and that you were hoping that tai chi would help you with the wobblies. Uh-huh? Is that you?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"And so, are you going back to tai chi?"
"Um, yes-yes I-I do because I-- my friend, I think I told you, really, loves it and I just, I wish I could go back, and. I dont make much sense but I do."
"Uh-huh. Uhhhh. Um, I think it's important, um, that you know that you're the one who has to make the tai chi"
"Haha, not really after just one time."
Uh-huh. Uhhhh.
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's-it's-- I can't make that-- It wouldn't be fair for me to say that does or doesn't. Not that one time, but you know."
"So, you havent seen the results that you want yet-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-but because Dr. Fields has recommended it and your friend has-
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-and it sounds like you like the instructor-
"Yeah, I'm doing that."
-it sounds like you would like to try and give it another chance?
"Yeah, I'd definitely do that."
"So, what has to happen in order for you to get to tai chi again?"
"Made the arrangements again, that was a bit complicated, and, um, I'd have to get my head straight about feeling self-cious,"
Uh-huh. Uhhhh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Yeah, and the arrangement, arrangements a little complicated."
"Uh-huh. Uhhhh. So, how confident are you on a scale of 1 to 10 with one being not at all confident and 10 being very"
That I can make the arrangement?
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
Five. Fucking. Five.
Five. Fucking. Five.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Uh huh so-
"I-I mean I know I can, but it's really hard to do."
"Uh-huh. Uhhhh. What is it that makes it a five instead of a one, no confidence?"
Thats what I do by myself.
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
And I would really fe-- If I could get some sup-- Like if somebody could help me do it
Uh-huh. Uhhhh.
"My-my daughter can't visit that often and, um-"
Uh-huh. Uhhhh.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"So, in order to make those arrangements, you would like some help in making those arrangements?"
I'd definitely do that.
Uh-huh. Uhhhh.
I'd definitely do that.
And is that something that your daughter can do for you?
"Well, she could--she could, but I'd have to wait at least a week."
"okay. ok. ok. Um, so is that something that you would like us to help you with?"
I'd definitely do that.
Uh-huh. Uhhhh.
"Yeah, yeah. Is this possible?"
Sure can make those arrangements with the rehabilitation centers. They have a van-
Uh-huh. Uhhhh.
-and- they did this for other patients so we can certainly make those arrangements if you'd
That would- that would be good. And then I'd have to do that myself as far as feeling self confident
"okay. ok. ok. So, are there any other barriers or obstacles in getting to tai chi?"
"Um, I can't think of any."
okay. ok. ok.
That-that's the point-
Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok.
- arrangements.
"Well, it sounds like you can see that you're making some progress in your physical therapy."
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes
"And you want tai chi another chance, and that if we can help make arrangements for you to get there with the van to"
Thats-- Yeah.
okay. ok. ok.
Thats true.
"Well, um, before you leave today, we'll go ahead and, um, make those arrangements."
You'd? You'd? You'd
Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure. I-I'm- happy to-
That would really help.
"And then when you come back in, I know you got another follow up appointment with Dr. Fields, I'd like to check back"
okay. ok. ok.
Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. You are welcome.
"Well, thank you so much for coming in today Mrs. Smith and I look forward to hearing about your progress"
okay. ok. ok.
Hi Dr. Martin. Lori. I am Lori. I'm the pharmacist on duty today. I understand that you have some questions about the medication citalopram. Is there a moment you are ready to talk about that?
"Yeah, I'm doing, just a couple of minutes though"
"Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. Well, do you have any specific questions?"
"Um, nothing specific. Im just unfamiliar with medication"
"okay. ok. ok. Well, citalopram is an SSRI medication. Its indication is for depression and its typically dosed as a 20 milligram tablet but its available as 10, 20, and 40 milligrams. 4-8 weeks of treatment with this medication should improve symptoms in any patients."
"okay. ok. ok. Uh, what about side effects?"
"This can include GI effects, sedation, or sexual dysfunction. If there are side effects,. But if you have a patient that suffers from any of those things, you can try either decreasing the dose or change. Any other questions?"
"Um, what about does this interact with phenelzine?"
"Oh, that I didn't know. Um, can I get back to you later this afternoon with that reply?"
"Oh, sure."
Fantastic. Fantastic. Thank you. You are welcome.
Thank you. You are welcome.
Did you enjoy how your parents raised you?
tell me about how your parents raised you right?
tell me about how you felt?
okay. ok. ok. guess Ive gotten fatter
"Mm, what is this like"
"Uh, creepy I suppose."
So you feel uncomfortable with changes in your body?
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I-I know there's something in there, I just don't know much about him"
Mm. the mf.
"I know you want me to see the doctor, I havent called yet"
Why is it so hard for you to call out?
I'm not sure. I feel like this is overwhelming
What about it seems overwhelming?
"Well, I hate making phone calls and I know I need to fill out all this paperwork. I dont know how to get there and hate needles"
"Mm. the mf. So some of your feelings, uh, of being overwhelmed or about the logistics of getting an appointment, and some of it is you just"
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes
How can I help you with these things?
Can you help me make this call?
"Sure, we can do that together."
Can you come with me to the appointment
"I'm allowed to try. I can't guarantee because it depends on my schedule, but we can brainstorm about ideas on who can go with you to"
"Good morning, Rick. Welcome. Welcome."
Kia ora.
"Good to see you here. I see on your file that you are, uh, [unintelligible 00:01:18]"
Yup. Yup. Yup. Thats right. Thats it. That
What part of the [unintelligible 00:01:22] are you from?
I'm from down south.
"Oh, okay. That's okay."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
Right down the bottom. Down Bluff? Down Bluff? Down
Yes sir. Yes sir. Yes sir. I'm from Invercargill just short of Bluff. All my family still down there
"Oh, are they. So you were born down there and-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
-raising up there?
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. Country boy. Country boy. Country boy
Country boy. Country boy. Country boy. Been up in Christchurch how long
Ive been up since I was 18
"Oh, so you've been here a while?"
Just a little while. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Oh good. Good. Good. Yall got family out here?
"Uh, just my own."
"Just your own whānau here. [unintelligible 00:01:51]. Well, Rick, I sorta, uh, wanna see that, you and I have been doing some work together for a while. I sort of wonder what sort of thoughts you would have on your way out of here today."
"Um, I was thinking of what you might ask me, what I would say. Me thinking about having my kids, thinking about having to take a day off work."
Right. Right. Right.
This is some bitches.
"okay. ok. ok. I see you had experience with, uh, coming to prevention services."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
What was that like in the past?
"Uh, it was okay. Um, it's not been bad."
Right. Right. Right.
"I'm not sure. Kind of nothing, really."
okay. ok. ok. Similar sort of offending in the past that brought you back again this time?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"One thing that I learned over the years, Rick, is that a lot of guys get to the doors out there and dont come inside and. What does that say about you?"
"Um, I hope that says that I want to, um, make some changes."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
So is this different from when you came in here before?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And still got to walk through those doors so-
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"-but, um, I just think about my kids, yall."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So they're important to you?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And do you have your kids with you full time or-
"No. No no no no no. Nah, I'm not. I see them, um, once a fortnight."
okay. ok. ok. And what is it like to be this good?
This shit sucks.
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"What would you really want in terms of, uh, you and your children?"
"I'm just-- I just want to be able to see them whenever I can, whenever I want to"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"You know. You know. I, um, they are my whole world and-and- I have fucked things up."
Right. Right. Right.
"So, you know."
"So coming along to see me and you and do some work together then you and your kids go on a program, how"
This is really important.
"Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. If I had to put it on a scale of say 1 to 100, 1 being not really important, 100 being really, location on that scale"
"It's, uh, hard because- because- because I'm, uh, not a bad person. I did some stupid shit but I'm not a bad person"
Right. Right. Right.
I would 100% be 100% in-in regards to my kids.
Right. Right. Right.
"If it means say, I can have my--see my kids anytime I- whenever I-"
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What would it be like if your kids were sitting here right now and you said that this is really, really important to you and to. That's 100% what you gave this program. Well then, what might that be like for them to hear that?"
"Um, I-I-I would hope that they would be proud of me. I wouldnt want my kids to see me- to see me here though. But I- But I hope they would be proud of me"
okay. ok. ok.
'Cause I'm-- Yeah.
Good. Good. Good. Good. Anybody else in your family that would be proud to--that you take these steps?
Um oh my mom.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Your is mum still down south?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Does she know that you are today?
No. No no no no no
So how might that work for her if she knew that you were talking like this today. Thats-- 'Cause it sounds to me like youre serious this time making some changes.
"Yeah, I am."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Just, um, I'm not- don't- know where to s-- where to start. I'm not sure."
So do you think doing this program and completing this program this time would be a good place to start?
"Yeah, I hope so. I-- So I would genuinely want to, I genuinely want to do something to help myself. Im not purposely fucks things up for myself."
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So yall and I are going to do some work together then. And, um, and sometimes it-can get quite tough. And I just wonder before we go any further, when the going gets tough, a lot of guys bail out. I just wanna know are you one of these guys?"
Nah this is important
Right. Right. Right.
"I've got, um, I've got, um, I got, um, I got"
"Good. Good. Good. Good. One of the other things we are so conscious of with is, um, sometimes we do this work in isolation from other. And one thing we want to ask people is about who they are accountable to. I be thinking like with your kids, uh, your mom and other people that maybe you interact with. Who else in your life do you think would be supportive of you, and who would you need to let them know that you are actually going through this sort"
"I, um, separated myself at this moment from my missus and-"
What was-- what was your partner's name?
"Uh, Kirsty. Kirsty. Kirsty"
Kristy. That. Is. All
"I would love f-f-for her to know that I do this and for her to know that I mean it, but, um, I know she wouldn't give"
Right. Right. Right. Would you be supportive in terms of your employer?
"Uh, yeah, I'm not sure. I may be but idk if I want them to know though"
okay. ok. ok. What do you think it might be like for you to explore that with them?
"Uh, I'm not sure."
"Any other family members that, uh, live close that, think would be supportive?"
I be pretty up here
"okay. ok. ok. The reason why I asked this, Rick, is just, uh, you know, part of, uh, being responsible turns up and do"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"The other aspect of that is kinda like who we accountable to while we do the program. So one of the challenges, one of the riddle I put in front of you is like who else can we get involved to support you while you goin"
"Um, I'm not sure. I'm not, um, that many people-"
okay. ok. ok.
"-that I am-- I'm not that many people I trust to support me. My mates, I love them but, um, yeah, I dont know."
"okay. ok. ok. So as we do this work together and go through this, uh, this program, one of the things we-we- don't want to do is fall in. So I-Im just trying to leave this with you to think about next time we come together. other people who you think can be really supportive, that we-we need to let know that you [unintelligible 00:10:50] each make these changes and this time. So let your mother and, uh, and, partner, how might that happen. How does that sound to you?"
"Yeah, give this a thought."
"Rick, I'm getting a sense that you're kind of padding this walk a bit on your own at the moment. Would that be true?"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Thatll definitely be true
"Your family is down south. I mean, who-who else do you think would be really interested in sup-supporting you, rowing with you if you like on this journey?"
"Uh, I'm in a good relationship with my mum,-"
okay. ok. ok.
-with my brothers and sisters.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
My mum is actually pretty
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mum do you think, if you were to tell her that this is something that you--is really important for you and that you. What-what might that mean for her to hear?"
I think she would be proud
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Brothers and sisters, would also be very supportive if you were to make this journey?"
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. A good, uh, good family."
"Good. Good. Good. Good. So how would you go about getting them to support you, to come on board, and be accountable to doing this work"
"Um, I'm not sure. Um, have some-somebody just listen."
"And, um, I’m just trying to imagine what your mom would want to say to you if she was sitting here with us now"
She would- she would tell me that she loves me. I would have told her that she believes that I could make her do it.
"Mm. the mf. What do you think she might want for you, like upon her for your children?"
For them to have a dad they can look up to.
I’m getting a strong sense that this is what you want as well
This is what I want. Definitely. Definitely.
"So, in terms of having the confidence to do this with the support of your whānau and ours, where do you think your"
I want to say that would be higher if I had their support of my-my family and [silence]. just know that i fucked up in the past. If they were there to support me then I’d be 99% sure
"That's a massive move up the scale, isn't it. So getting your family on board, getting your whānau on board is going to be really important for us"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Tell me what you know about flu shots?
"Uh, well, I know the flu can be pretty bad, but I'm in pretty good health so I don't really feel like I need. Uh, it kinda just more for old people, huh?"
"Mm, um, so you think its only for people who are-are vulnerable to illness?"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Would it be okay if I shared some more information about the flu vaccine and the importance of it?
okay. ok. ok.
"So you're right that you're young and healthy and you don't have a lot of complicating diseases that mean that you'd probably. Elderly are more at risk, pregnant people, babies are at risk of having serious complications from the flu, and by you getting the"
okay. ok. ok.
"So having shared that information with you, how do you feel about the flu vaccine?"
"Well, my grandparents probably wouldn't handle the flu well-"
Mm. the mf.
-and my co-worker is pregnant too
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"So-so, yeah, I guess, I should, uh, get this for their sake."
"Ok, so you have some people in your life who are vulnerable to potential illness, and making this decision to get the flu"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Hi. Nice to meet you. Are you Julie Thompson?
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Hi, I'm Bruce Berger. I'm at work in the clinic and, uh, notice that you're in to pick up prescription for Sarah's, uh, rescue inhaler-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
-for her asthma. I noticed that she has been in the emergency room 5 times this year for her asthma. What is this- what has been going on
"It's been- it's been really hard. Um, I hate to see her gasping for breath. And, um, I'm really worried, you know, when she has to go. Uh, so that's been-- it's really difficult when I have to take her out."
"Yeah, sounds like you would be willing to do whatever you can to try to prevent that from happening."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"okay. ok. ok. I-I also noticed that, uh, it's been about 3 months or so since you picked her prescription for her chronic"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
Are you having some difficulties with that?
"Well, I've done research on chronic inhaler and found out that there are steroids in it and that-that I don't want her. I've done, uh, research on some of the potential side effects and some of the health issues that can result from taking steroids and. At all times I dont want her exposed. And then, uh, just to make this clear, let me just lay this out right here. Uh, because I know it will come up, but I-I do smoke. I make sure that I dont smoke around her so that I make sure that it doesnt affect her. So-"
okay. ok. ok.
-Just wanna let you know that right off
"Well, Sarah sounds like you care a lot. You-you dont want her, uh, using steroids. You worry about what kind of effects those would have on her and you- you work hard to keep your smoking away from her so it"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"okay. ok. ok. We talked a bit about chronic inhaler and the medicine that you are concerned about, you know, the steroids c. Uh, can we just talk about that?"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"okay. ok. ok. Even tho, even tho this medicine isnt the-medic that is in this is in the same broad family as the steroids you are worried"
okay. ok. ok.
Which build people up and have masculinizing effects.
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"If-if I can draw an analogy-- Again, even though this medicine is in the same family as those big broad- broad. If I could draw an analogy, a grape and watermelon are in the same family of fruits, you know, and obviously. And if you eat one grape you would be fine. If you ate an entire watermelon that can make you very sick. If we look at grape as medicine your daughter is taking, again, it's in the same broad family, the amount of drug that your. Uh, and not only that it's not anabolic steroid, even though it's in the same big family. And what this drug does is actually reduce the inflammation in your daughter's lungs. And-and it doesnt even get absorbed into the body. Only her lungs can do that. And as I said, I wouldn't want your daughter taking a medication that could have the impact of those an. This is really safe for your daughter to use. So what-what are your thoughts on considering having her use this?"
"Well, I-I guess I didn't realize that they weren't the same thing as the anabolic steroids."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Which are the ones that cause all the problems and everything. So, um, if- you can assure me that it won't have those same side effects and health issues-"
"Definitely wouldnt. I mean, probably you've seen the name corticosteroid and thought, ""uh-oh"""
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"You know. You know. And so-- yeah, and that- and that does concern people. But I do want to reassure you that this is medication that only goes to her lungs, and not the ones you are worried"
okay. ok. ok.
Mind if I talk to you a bit about what your daughter's lungs look like when she has these inflammations and need
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"okay. ok. ok. When-when somebody has asthma, their lungs are like hypersensitive. if-if-if-if-if-if-if-if-if-if-if-if-if-if-if-if-if-if-if-if-if-if-if-if-if-. But when the skin on your arm burns you literally react to it. Her lungs are exquisitely sensitive. Uh, and like the skin on your arm would be if the skin got burned off. And what this drug can do. This chronic inhaler reduces the inflammation in her lungs so that her lungs can stay exquisitely sensitive. Because otherwise, everything in the air like dust, pollen, uh, reacts with her, uh, in ways that it would not normally affect us."
"Oh, okay. That's okay."
And so this chronic inhaler can really prevent that from happening. Okay? Okay. Okay. Okay. Which is why it's so important to use it.
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Tell you is that, unfortunately, uh, even tho you are smoking outside and keeping the smoke away from her, the smoke on your clothes,. I wouldnt mind if you use the chronic inhaler every day, she may not be sensitive to the smoke on your clothes. Um, honestly, I would love to see you quit smoking for you too because, as you know, it's not real good for you."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Uh, and it would certainly help her. Um but what I wouldnt mind is, kinda, keeping an eye on what happens when she uses the chronic inhaler. And if she flares up when you around her, if there is smoke on your clothes because it-can flare her up."
"Oh, even when it's just on my clothes?"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
She's that sensitive. If I realized that differential
"It-it-it-it-it-it-it. It may not- it may not when she uses the chronic inhaler, uh, but you'll need to keep an eye on that. Obviously, it would be- what would be best if it didnt get on your clothes, or quit smoking."
"Right. Right. Right. Um, so would that help, um-- You know, quitting smoking is a pretty daunting aspect."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"I mean, I know people who have tried to quit and it's-it's just-it's-it's-it's-that-it's-that. So I know, would have been betterphalic"
"Very hard. Very hard. It's very relaxing, and-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
And-and it's hard to replace it with something.
"Yeah, it is. Um. Is. That. Okay"
"So, uh, any thoughts on what you may be able to do to-help at this point, if you don't choose to quit right away?"
"I was thinking, um, if since it, you know, it affects her that it's on my clothes, if only she'd been at school. Would that help?"
"Lol, that-that sounds like it would be great if you could do that. Obviously, dont smoke in your house, you know- you know."
"Oh, absolutely. Never. Never. Never. Ever. Ever. Ever"
"Um, so yeah. If you're willing to do that, that certainly helps."
okay. ok. ok.
"Uh, again, if you get to the point where you're willing to quit for both you and her, uh, we'd be glad to help. Because you are right it is- it is not an easy thing to do."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [chuckles]
okay. ok. ok.
That's really out of the question.
"So it sounds like right now where we are, is you willing to- have her use the chronic inhaler-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"-to try to get the inflammation down so she doesnt need to go to the emergency room and do whatever you can at this point to. And I think you see big changes in terms of, uh, her not needing to go to the emergency room, and you probably ha"
"Oh, really? Oh, really? Oh"
"Yeah, because you get that inflammation down."
"Oh, that's awesome-"
okay. ok. ok.
-because that's always so creepy when she has to use that one.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So lets go ahead and get both prescription and surgery ready
okay. ok. ok.
"Use the chronic inhaler every day, keep the rescue inhaler around if she needs it. Uh, and let's see how that works."
okay. ok. ok.
Okay? Okay. Okay. Okay
That sounds good. Thank you. You are welcome.
Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. Good. Good. Good. Good
Hi Sal. Good morning. Thanks for coming out today
No problem. No problem.
"I've seen that your doctor has made the referral and, um, and I really appreciate you taking the time to"
"Yeah, it's-it's a bit of an inconvenience I'd say, but I'm here anyway."
So youve made it in here-
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
- and do you have a sense of- what some of the doctor's concerns led her to refer you to?
"idk, something about changing my life even more. The smoking has changed, now it's, you know, cut down the drinking, get rid of those extra smokes, get. I'm not sure what else has to do."
"So your asthma has been acting up and theres a lot of stuff, not just the asthma going on?"
"Yeah, stress is a lot too much for me. My wife is still on maternity leave, she doesnt get paid, shes with the baby right now. And I'm the only person that's working right now, and plus I got to change all these things that are going on in my life"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. Almost disproportionate
"Yeah, that's a lot."
Almost overwhelming it sounds like
"Yeah, yeah, it's overwhelming. This is. It is."
"15 or 20 minutes together and I wonder, would it be okay, if we took a few minutes and just looked at all of the different things that"
"Yeah, it just feels like everything is all over the place but I guess we gotta start somewhere"
"okay. ok. ok. Well, one of the things that-that-we-use are these--it's kind of like a worksheet and it's an agenda-set"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"So if you were to-to-list all the different things that people around you are saying that you need to work on or. And, Sal, just because we write them down here, doesnt mean that you need to change them."
okay. ok. ok.
"It really-- You have to put all the cards on the table, so to speak, it's just to be in the driver's seat."
"okay. ok. ok. Um, okay, that sounds good. As long as I'm not changing anything and we just kinda put, um, pen to paper or something, I guess"
Yep. Thats it. That
"Um, okay, so my asthma."
"Okay, so asthma is one."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
What else? Nothing else.
"Um, the fact that they want me to get rid of Oscar, that's-that's my dog."
"So your dog, and- the doctor says the dog ratio"
"Well, he-- Yeah, he-- He said it as a primary-- It's a primary contributor to my asthma problems."
okay. ok. ok.
Which I'm not- I'm not- I'm not- I'm not- I'm not- I'm not- I'm not- I'm not- I'm not- I'm not-
Pretty shocking to hear that you have to get rid of your dog.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. My wife has been there before the dog has been there. I know Ive had him longer
Hmm. Interesting. So this is a massive stress right now?
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's- it's a big stress, it's like my best friend, so that's one of the important things. Also, I guess, cutting down these last cigarettes I worked on."
"Okay, so smoking and- I'm working towards quitting completely sounds like that's a goal for you?"
"Um, finances is a problem right now too"
Okay. So. Much. Money.
"Time, got to come to all these appointments and take time off work, which obviously is the money factor, right?"
Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. So appointments and time.
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Um, and some of these things are kinda related to each other I think we already see"
"Yeah, yeah. Yeah, there's something going on here. Also, um, also my drinking, got to cut down on my drinking too."
okay wow. wow. So much happening right now Sal. Anything else that concerns you?
"No. No no no no no. It just overwhelming when you see them all, you know?"
"Right. Right. Right. Where would you-- I mean, if you- had to pick somewhere, one or two kind of high priorities or-or things to talk abo"
"I'm thinking- I think the dog's thoughts about him has definitely bothered me, that's been one"
okay. ok. ok.
"And, um, my-my asthma is out of control too. So maybe those two."
"Okay, and those are pretty related-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
- sounds like. okay. ok. ok.
"I understand that your asthma symptoms just really went out of control. So, here are some of the ways that you can get healthy and not be back here again."
"Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. Yea, I'm de-I definitely don't wanna come back here. But, uh, the doc said Oscar, my dog, is connected to my asthma symptoms. But the-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"-ridiculous part is Ive had him for 12 years before, and now its a problem."
"Well, you sound a bit surprised. But I bet you have seen some of the material that-that the clinic has given you about asthma symptoms and managing your"
"Yeah, but I-- Um, let me just clarify, I have seen the materials, I have them-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"-Ive even read them. All I been doing is taking the medicine. So, I'm not that familiar with this."
"Wait a second Sal, what do you mean you- you- ha- If you-- As in-- you- ha- I understand from your chart that"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-new born baby.
"John Carlo, yeah."
"-and you are very concerned about your health, you wanna be there for your baby and that youve already taken some steps, you-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"-which is fantastic. So, the next step is to really deal with the dog, deal with the pet. I know it- so- It would be hard to do that. But there are always people who adopt animals. I think you have friends or family members."
"Uh, this is a bit too much for me now. John Carlo is taken care of first. Thats fine. He's not- no asthma from the dog. This is just me. Im not haportionate"
"Its you that worries me, Sal. Its you that worries me, right. The- symptoms are worse. Youve had 2 or 3 major asthma attacks. And-and do you appreciate how--this is, uh, a risk to your life that some-some-some adults with severe asthma can die as a. It-it truly is something to take very, very seriously. Cant stress enough that this is a good thing."
"So, Oscar is gonna make me die. 12 years later and the doctor is still saying, ""Oh, I don't know if it's the stress, the finances, the drinking."". So, what are we saying Oscar could make me die. Ive had him for 12 years."
"Sal, what, uh, do you understand that what happened 6 years ago or 10 years ago, your asthma has gotten worse. You know very well that puffers, strength of medication, get higher and higher, and there is only so much that can be done with. This is what you know."
"Well, they can keep giving me more medicine and giving me the strongest one, and I'll keep Oscar."
"Sal, youre almost on the strongest one. And if Oscar is that important to you then do you put Oscar higher than your child, than your wife. Like, uh, that makes no sense to me. Do you understand how important this is?"
"I understand but I dont think you get my situation. 12 years of this dog. So, I can't just up and get him out of my house when I don't even know that's the main"
"Uh, okay, well"
Barbara Roberts? No way
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Morning. Morning. Morning.
Good morning there.
Good morning.
My last name is Dr. Betty. I am one of the new GPs in practice. 1. What would you guys like me to call you? 2. What would you guys
"Well, you can call me Barbara. Thatll be fine. Thank you. You are welcome."
"Oh, okay, that's fine. okay. ok. ok. So, Barbara, I see you today, um, but I think it's usually Dr. Brown that sees you, is that right?"
"Yes, Dr. Brown is my doctor."
okay. ok. ok. What is it that brought you to see me today?
"Well, Ive come about my tummy problem. I have terrible stomach and, uh, Dr. Brown just doesnt seem to get to the bottom of it. And I thought maybe, uh, I'll come and see you to see if you can help"
Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. okay. ok. ok. Can you tell me more about your tummy issues?
"Um, well, I-I'm having this awful discomfort nearly all the time. Um, it's very often feels bloated. Um, I'm swinging between being constipated and having diarrhea. Um, I'm having sort of cramps sometimes, and other times it stabs. This is real stabbing feeling. Um, I'm often tempted to go to the toilet and, um, and pass very smelly wind."
"Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. So, quite a few symptoms there-"
Mm. the mf.
- and some of them sound-
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes
- quite troublesome to you.
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes
okay. ok. ok. And how long has this been going on?
"Well, I, uh, I trace it back to a holiday I had in Egypt about 4 years ago. I've had, um, a horrible bout of sickness and diarrhea, and, uh, and I don't think my stomach has ever been real since"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. okay. ok. ok. okay. ok. ok. So you're saying this holiday began after this 4 year hiatus?
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes
okay. ok. ok. And what- what sort of treatment have you tried for- this before?
"Well, uh, Dr. Brown gave me some muscle relaxants at the beginning of the day."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Um but Ive been to the health store and- theyve been really helpful. They gave me a lot of different, um, tablets and medicine-"
Right. Right. Right.
"- for different things. Um, no, oh, and Immodium."
Right. Right. Right.
Immodium in my handbag all the time just in case. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Right. Right. Right. So, these different tablets that you get from the-"
Hmm. Interesting.
- the herbal shop-
Hmm. Interesting.
- how are you taking them?
"Oh, well, different tablets, you know, I'm not the same everyday-"
Right. Right. Right.
"- so i'll be taking some tablets for certain, uh, symptoms, and-"
Right. Right. Right.
- other tablets for other things.
"So, am I- am I right in thinking that you may decide on a day-to-day basis-"
Hmm. Interesting.
- what you take-
Hmm. Interesting.
- depending on what your stomach does?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
okay. ok. ok. okay. ok. ok. And what about tests. Have you had any tests for these issues?
"Yes, uh, I've had, uh, in the early days, a gastros-gas-- What are they called?"
A gastroscopy.
That's it. That's the tweet. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes
Youve got the tube down-down from the top?
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
okay. ok. ok.
"Um, and at the same time I had barium enema."
Right. Right. Right.
That was very uncomfortable.
okay. ok. ok.
"Um, but, um, no, I tried--well, you-- I don't think he has tried enough tests because he said after that, that"
Right. Right. Right.
"-and he-he-he just-he-he-he-he-he-he-. That's it, that's the tweet-"
Right. Right. Right.
- as far as he concerned. Sent me back to the doctor
Right. Right. Right. This sounds as though you-you don't like that
"Well, you know, I think that actually, the NHS are running short of money, aren't they. And he-"
Right. Right. Right.
- decided that Ive had enough tests.
Right. Right. Right.
"And, um, you know, if you go on social media-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
- there are loads of tests that he couldve sent me for.
Right. Right. Right.
"Um, if I had more money, I would go private."
Right. Right. Right.
Just dont think he has to the bottom of it
"Right. Right. Right. So you feel as though actually, enough hasnt been done in the way of- tests?"
"No, he isnt. There are loads more he could do. I think so."
Right. Right. Right. okay. ok. ok. It sounds like you-you had these issues now for about 4 years.
Mm. the mf.
You- you have various symptoms in your stomach.
Mm. the mf.
"Um, you tried a lot of tablets. Some prescribed, some herbal remedies-"
Mm. the mf.
"- and you had some investigations, but you didn't quite get the full story-that you hav"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Is this- is this about-
"I would have said so, yes."
- if I got the story right.
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes
"okay. ok. ok. And can I ask you, Barbara, how-is all of this affecting you day-to-day. How does this affect you?"
"Uh, well, it had quite the impact. Um, the first thing, the biggest thing, I suppose, is that I-I went from being full time at work to part time at"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
Just couldnt sit all day comfortable
Right. Right. Right.
"Um, and so I've been going part time, but in the end, I, uh, about a year or so ago, stopped work"
Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right.
"Um, I miss that."
Right. Right. Right.
"Girls. I miss you. I mean, we used to, uh, we used to go out at least once a week."
Right. Right. Right.
To the pics or for a drink. Thats one thing.
Sounds as though that's something you quite enjoy.
"Yeah, so I-- Yes. Yes, we used to have a laugh."
Right. Right. Right. okay. ok. ok.
"Um, I used to go to Swing and Shape. I've been using to go to an exercise class-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"- that was, um, I miss the exercise, actually. That was, um, once a week, but you know, the thing was I wasnt comfortable, never felt quite right doing all this. I've always been worried that I'll get taken short or-- So I stopped that."
Right. Right. Right.
"Um, then-- Well, my husband and I used to go out for food."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
Thats another thing we dont do anymore
Right. Right. Right.
"Um mm. mm. Yeah, quite a few things, really."
"Yeah, it does- it does sound as though over the years your life has really changed-"
Mm. the mf.
- quite a lot because of these symptoms.
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes
This sounds- it sounds like you are doing the review of the things that you used to do.
Mm. the mf.
Right. Right. Right.
Mm. the mf.
"So, what is it that you spend your average day doing now?"
"Well, I'm potting around the house-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"- um, I'm spending perhaps a bit too much time watching. I got hooked on daytime television, gotta say."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Um, they're drawing you in, don't they?"
They sure do.
"Um, I'm reading a bit-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"- the old magazines, but, uh, generally, I'm at home."
Right. Right. Right.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"okay. ok. ok. okay. ok. ok. And have you noticed any significant changes in your symptoms over the last 4 years. For example, have there been any times where things have been better for you?"
"Um, well, last year, um, my son got married-"
Right. Right. Right.
"- and I- I must say I was worried that, um, that I would not be able to cope with it."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"I wouldnt have felt well enough, but surprisingly enough, um, I was in good form, getting ready for it-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
- and the whole hoo-ha of the wedding.
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
But that was in good form for me. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Right. Right. Right.
That was fun.
Right. Right. Right. And how was your tummy symptoms then?
I've barely noticed them.
Right. Right. Right. okay. ok. ok.
"Yeah, it, uh, seemed to, uh, clear up."
Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right.
Which was good.
Right. Right. Right. Thats interesting.
Mm. the mf.
And are there any times when your-your tummy symptoms bother you more than usual. Seems particularly bad?
"Um, well, it- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I-"
Right. Right. Right.
"Especially, um, uncomfortable. Um, I gotta say I do notice when my husband is away. He-"
Right. Right. Right.
"- travels with his job, and-"
Right. Right. Right.
- can be away a few times a month.
Uh-huh. Uhhhh.
"Um, and that's not-- It- It's very often not good then, I have to say."
Right. Right. Right. So you notice it gets a bit worse when your husband is away. okay. ok. ok.
"Mm. the mf. I may be thinking about it a bit more, idk, when he isnt there"
Right. Right. Right. I know youve been seeing Dr. Brown lately
Mm. the mf.
What is it that he said that he thinks might be wrong with you?
"Well, he-he thinks it all in my head."
Right. Right. Right.
"You know, he- he says stress."
Right. Right. Right. okay. ok. ok.
Mm. the mf.
And what do you think?
"Well, I mean, it can't all be in my head. Physical pain- I get too much physical pain-"
Right. Right. Right.
"- for it to be in my head. I mean, this is real. This is-it real pain."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
Umphaloid
And have you had any thoughts yourself about what might be causing this?
"Well, I mean, I-I thought that perhaps it was an infection that hadnt cleared up-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"- in the early stages but, um, I think, um, I think, um, I think, sometimes it's IBS. I have a friend who got that and it sounds similar, and then-"
Right. Right. Right.
"- other times I'll think, ""I wonder if this is an ulcer."""
Right. Right. Right.
"Um, on a really bad day, I start thinking it might be cancer."
Right. Right. Right.
"Um, my mother-in-law- my mother-in-law died of cancer last year and had a, um, a growth that-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
- the-doctor didnt investigate.
Right. Right. Right.
"But by the time they found it, it was the size of a football-"
Oh dear. Lovely.
"- and it was- too late to operate then, so it was-"
Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right.
"So, when I go to bed at night now, um, I just feel to make sure there's nothing different"
Right. Right. Right.
"And, uh, yeah, I'm worried about that."
So you- you- you- you- you- you- you- you- you- you- you- you
"Oh, yes. Thats it. That"
To see if you can feel anything?
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes
Right. Right. Right.
"Im just trying to make sure there is nothing changing down there, yall know?"
Right. Right. Right. okay. ok. ok.
Mm. the mf.
"okay. ok. ok. So just to-make sure that I got the-story straight, you-have-seen-dr.-brown for a few years"
Mm. the mf.
You- you tried a variety of medications-
Mm. the mf.
"- some prescribed, some-"
Mm. the mf.
- from the-herbal shop. None of them really made a difference. You had some investigations-
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
- but you may feel you have not investigated enough. And at times you worry that this could be something quite serious like a-
Mm. the mf.
- a cancer. Is this-- Have I got the-
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes
- story right?
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
okay. ok. ok.
I would have said so.
"okay. ok. ok. Barbara, what was it that made you hope that I would do for you today?"
"Well, I thought, you know, you're a new doctor here-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"- and you just finished your medical training. I've been wondering whether, with new eyes and a new way of looking at-at the problem-"
Right. Right. Right.
"- um, you- probably know about different tests, new tests, that my doctor doesnt know about, you-"
Right. Right. Right.
So maybe you could send me for some different tests
Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. So you were hoping that I would send you for more tests?
Mm. the mf.
okay. ok. ok.
"Well, I think there's-there's something that a test might-"
Right. Right. Right.
- might reveal.
"Right. Right. Right. okay. ok. ok. I think having to send you for more tests at this point would be the most useful thing that we could do for you Barbara. And the reason for that is because you have-you have had some of the main investigations in the past few years, and-and-. And your symptoms hasnt really changed that much. So it's very unlikely that if we'd sent you for more tests now that-that-they'd show anything different than. So a bit-- I think it would be a waste of time for you to go for more tests."
"So-so like, do you think this is all in my head then. You will be like Dr. Brown. Yall think I'm imagining all of this?"
"Uh, no. No. No no no. I think that you clearly have pain, and clearly you have lots of physical symptoms, and they are clearly getting in the"
Mm. the mf.
-your life and causing you a lot-
Mm. the mf.
-of disability.
Mm. the mf.
I guess- I guess the way I think about these things is that they are not necessarily either all in the mind or all in the body.
Mm. the mf.
"Sometimes these things can go hand in hand. Uh, I guess I'm thinking about how you told me last year, when your son got married, uh, and you were very busy-"
Mm. the mf.
"- and quite happy, that somehow your symptoms seemed less than usual."
Mm. the mf.
"And, uh, when your husband is away, which is something you don't like very often, sometimes, your symptoms then. I wonder, Barbara, is there any link between how you feel in your mind, and how your symptoms trouble you. Is this a possibility?"
"Well, I can't see that my mind can cause this amount of pain."
"Mm. the mf. I said that pain is in your mind. Um, I guess what I'm saying is that sometimes the way that we feel, and the way that our life is, can impact how. Considering that weve tried medication for you, and weve tried investigations, and drew blank really, with those,"
No. No no no no no
- I guess I'm wondering whether now it would be a good idea to try a different approach to your problems.
What-what sort of approach?
"Well, I guess, thinking a bit about those other areas of your life, um, uh, I think the. It seems to have really shrunk down."
Mm. the mf.
And it sounds as though you don't do a lot of the things that you used to do. That you-
No. No no no no no
- used to get pleasure out of. Is this correct?
"Well, I'm just unable to do them."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Cant- I cant- I cant- I cant- I cant- I
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I wonder--Uh, I wonder if, in a funny way, what's happened is the fact that you-you-d"
Mm. the mf.
- unhappy with the way that-that your life is at the moment. And-and I guess I wonder whether that can then make your symptoms worse for you.
"Oh, I'm not sure."
Mm. the mf.
I'm not sure.
"I wonder is one of the approaches we need to use now thinking about what you do with your day, and maybe"
Mm. the mf.
"- with your- female friends once a week, and whether actually doing those sorts of things might generally-"
Mm. the mf.
- improve your quality of life. I also think about the tablets that you take.
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"I seem to be taking quite a lot of them, and I wonder whether it's worth, though, sitting and looking at them and-"
Hmm. Interesting. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"What would you think about trying that slightly different approach for say-say 2 or 3 months, just to see whether or not"
"Well, 2 or 3 months is a long time if something is going on. I mean, that's what happened to my mother-in-law, yall."
Right. Right. Right.
They- they left her and-
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
- didnt spot this and cardiovascular
"Well, I guess if we- if we decided to- work together like this-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"- in this new approach, I would see you regularly. We can keep an eye on your symptoms, and if they change, then investigate as appropriate. But if they stay the same then, then, you know, we can be-"
Mm. the mf.
- pretty clear that there's nothing new that-that we're missing out on.
Mm. the mf.
How would that sound?
"So, uh, what are you saying then. Thats what I should come back and see?"
That would be a good idea I think. I'm starting to think we've only just begun to talk about this-
Mm. the mf.
"- and I think perhaps you need to have a bit of time to think about it and then perhaps come back. Perhaps if you booked in for a double slot next week, and that would give us a good chunk of time to think abou"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"And perhaps if you could also bring your- tablets in or- make a list of them, we can look at what you take. How would that sound, Barbara?"
"okay. ok. ok. Well, uh, to make an appointment for next week."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
And come and see you again-
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes
- and talk about it a bit more?
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. I'm thinking so.
okay. ok. ok.
I'm thinking that would be a good- a good start.
Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. And I will make a list of tablets that I take.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Im not bringing all the bottles down.
okay. ok. ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok.
okay. ok. ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. I'll do that.
"So, shall I see you again next week?"
I'm making an appointment for next week. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes
okay. ok. ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. Thank you Barbara.
okay. ok. ok. Thank you. You are welcome.
Bye bye. Bye bye.
"Minnesota State, Mankato security report states that you were stopped on Stadium Road last Friday, citing for driving under the influence. Plus, you're only 21 years old. Is the report accurate?"
"I-I'm not really sure, uh, I don't really remember much. I liked it was a week ago so I was kinda drunk too"
"okay. ok. ok. You could get suspended, Behaviour like this could get you suspended, doesn't it?"
"Hmm. Interesting. Not really. I mean, not really. I turn 21 in a few months. Um, once I turn 21, the cops can't give me a minor and I mean, I'm not a heavy drinker, like-. Im not wasting time at all. And, uh, just need to be careful. Im just not getting caught. I just want to find, like, a normal college student."
"What was your reaction when you got into your car after having 6 beers, you could have caused an accident and killed someone"
"Whatever, I-I didn't though. My roommates called me for a ride. He was so sleepy. So I had to get home somehow. And this isnt even my fault. I'm giving him rides all the time but I've done nothing"
"You need to take responsibility for your actions. If you keep partying like this your problems will only get worse. You may face expensive legal citations, poor grades, health issues. Getting kicked out of school and disappointing your parents. Dont you want that to happen"
"No-no. No no no no. Like I said, this isnt even my fault. Like, are we done here. 15 minutes of class"
"Your behavior is not what Minnesota State University expects from its students. If you wanna be a student here you need to show that you can follow our rules. Is it possible that you can do that, otherwise, you'll get suspended?"
"Look, I really like going on the [unintelligible 00:02:29] and getting what you say. You, you make some really good points and I'll think about them. Okay? Okay. Okay. Okay"
"okay. ok. ok. Well, your sanction is you will be placed on university disciplinary probation and have to attend an alcohol education seminar that. Also, disciplinary action is progressive and cumulative, meaning that any further violations result in a"
$150 are you serious. Cant pay that. okay im done with this. I'm over this. I'm over.
Hi Mike. Nice to meet you. I'm Kathy. I'm a good woman. Appreciate you coming out today
"Hi Kathy, nice to meet you"
"I know so many other places youd rather be than here today talking to me but, um, you are here, and, um, thank you"
okay. ok. ok.
"Um, I was trying to ask you how you are physically. Um, I wanna make sure you feel okay, if you feel okay, I'm not gonna make. And, um, 'cause your-your safety is of, uh, most importanter. So, if I could just ask you a few questions-"
Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure
"-Surrounding that, will that be okay?"
Absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"-um, we-we-we-we-we-we-we-we-we-we-. Thats what I gathered."
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. My DUI got me speeding, and I was clearly speeding, uh, during the DUI, obviously."
"Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh, okay. That's okay. So, Um, around that, um, do you ever feel-- Feel bad or-or sick when you-- Get"
"Nah, I'm fine. Yeah"
"Are you feeling okay. okay. good. good. good. Just wanted to make sure, um, and, um, if the last time you- drank was--"
"Last time I drink in the night, the DUI is the last time I drink."
"Uh huh, yeah."
"And then, uh, I guess, I'm here 'cause my lawyer wants me to go through an assessment-"
Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure
"I really dont know what this means or anything like that but, uh, he said I need to come here and, uh, just sayin"
"Oh, okay. That's okay. Well, I appreciate that."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Um, and also, if there's any-any-any information that you need from me, please, um, feel free to ask. Um, that's why he asked you to come in because of the blood alcohol level was 2.8."
okay. ok. ok.
"So, um, that was legally beyond your driving limit."
"Is it bad, or is it high or?"
"Well, it's-it's high, uh, you know, they--"
okay. ok. ok.
For driving.
Ok
"And so, um, the officer at the- at the scene, um, when you blew the 2.8, he-he did-- he-"
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, he was, freaking out. He was--"
Did he freaking out. Yeah-yeah.
"I think he was getting over the top a bit, but, y'all, again, whatever."
"Right-right. Right-right. So, um, I'll just ask you a few questions, um, if you don't mind drinking, then. And-and your-- So, um, you said the couple was two weeks ago was the last time you drank?"
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. okay. ok. ok. And, um, that night, what was it that you-you drank and, how much?"
"Um, a get together as it was birthday party in, uh, downtown, and, uh, you know, it's not like it's normal. Just, uh, I'm just, uh, using poor judgment. Shouldnt have driven that night"
"Right. Right. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um, I was-- Maybe, you could tell me about how much you were drinking."
"Um, I'm not really sure. I know, uh, I dunno, probably had like 5 or 6 drinks, I would think, something like that"
"Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. Five, 6 drinks, like?"
"Um, yeah, they were a little bigger than that. I'm not really-- I wasnt really counting, so, I don't really know."
"Oh, okay. That's okay. So, I guests maybe 5 or 6"
"5 or 6, something like that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah."
"Um, yeah. And-and, w-what were the drinks, werent they?"
Um absolute vodka-
Hmm. Interesting.
-and 7 off. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Oh, okay. That's okay. So, um, you said that pretty much only 5 or 6. Do you-- How often do you use that. And you said it aint a-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-not a normal occasion to drink that much?
"I kinda felt a bit drunk while I was- you know, when I was drinking, I just, uh,. Really shouldnt have driven"
"Right. Right. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um, so, you're usually not drinking that much. Um, on an average, maybe a week, how much would you say you drink. Just--"
"Um, sometimes I drink, um, you know, maybe one or two, and then I- and then I wont drink for a while, you know. So, it's not really a-- There's no really a pattern-"
Uh huh
"-it's not really like a uh- it's not a habit, you know, you know,"
Right. Right. Right.
"I-I'm not sure if I'd consider myself alcoholic. Just, uh, uhhhh, uhhhh, uhhhh, again, poor judgement."
"Right. Right. Right. So, it's not getting in your way-"
Oh no. No. No. No.
-everyday.
Absolutely not. Mm-mm. Thats it. That
"Right. Right. Right. Lol, that's good."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"So, um, Mike, when was it that you started thinking that when you did use alcohol, most in your life?"
"Um, there really wasnt a time that I, uh, did not, uh, do. I-I'm not understanding the question. I mean, it-- There really wasnt-- I dont really drink on a regular basis so, I dont know-- [crosstalk]"
"So, that's- that's a complete, uh, A question that's even relevant?"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
okay. ok. ok.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Thats fine.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Thats fine. okay. ok. ok. Um, so, what about the, uh, first DUI, could you give me a bit of a breakdown. This was your second one?"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"And so, that's sort of why I was asking about it earlier in your life if that was a--"
"seems like every time that i, uh, do more than a few drinks i tend to get in trouble. And, the 2 times that I did, got in trouble both times. [crosstalk]"
Those two times. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Yeah pretty much. I mean, this sounds odd, I know, but, uh, this is a good point."
This sounds like bad luck
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Actually, that-that-that-that-that-that-that-that-that-that-that-that"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
But the-the-alcohol hasnt really at all.
"Oh, okay. That's okay."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
But just that bad luck?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Is there alcohol with the- with-- Goes hand in hand with the bad luck or just--
Sure sounds like it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That sure seems like it.
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, okay. That's okay. So-so, what about that. -- Is there other incidences that you could think of that seem, uh, um, alcohol was there, and then your luck just sorta"
"Um, you know, I'm not really, um-- I- I don't really, uh, get into a situation where I- I- I drink too much. Um, again, I- I realize it's my second DUI, but,,, uh, uh, it's not something that, um, is like a normal everyday process"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Um, normally when I drink I drink one or two drinks and then stop. Um, so, it's not like it's, um-- You know, it's not like it's something that has become a problem in my life, you"
"Oh, good. Good. Good. Oh, good. Good. Good. And-and so, where do you usually, um, get your drinks. Is it at home or, uh, out-in-out for, uh, after work, social drinking?"
"Um, normally social."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's normally social. It would be, you know, maybe in events or something like that is normally when I would, um, drink more than one or two"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"guess i should probably just call a taxi cab or something, yall know. I wouldnt have this problem with that way."
Would that help?
"Um, probably, I think that would help. I'm thinking that would be something that I should, uh- I should work on."
"So, sounds like you already have, uh, ways to get around safely."
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, or I can just stay home probably too. I could probably stay home, then not get in trouble either, if I was gonna drink"
Youve given this a lot of thought
"Yeah, a bit."
"Yeah, good. Good."
"Yeah, obviously, because I just dont-- You know, I dont like getting in trouble, and I dont, uh,"
Trouble isnt fun.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
No. No no no no no
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. tell me a bit more about, um, when you fi-- If you find yourself, and then that-in the-car, does that come and go"
"Um oh, never getting in the car when I drink again. Thats-- Yeah. I-I would never do that again"
"This, this-- What-what was different?"
"Uh, I'm not trying to lose my license, you know."
Hmm. Interesting.
"I'm not, uh, you know, I'm not gonna lose my license."
Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. You- you need your license-
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-to get around. Work license is needed for you.
"Well, and then I-I sell cars for a living too, so--"
Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh
"-um, that would be, um, you know, I dont wanna lose my job either. I think those would be kind of connections."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"And, you know, I-- You don't have to call my work or anything for this, do you?"
No. No no no no no
"Oh, okay. That's okay."
Nah. No. No. No. That's--
Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok.
"That would be entirely up to you, um, to-to have that."
okay. ok. ok. I'm just not used to how that works
Oh no. No. No. No.
"I think if they found out, I might, you know, be in jeopardy with my job, because. So--"
"Well, you are. And-and-and I have you give, uh, credit for that. So much to come in today and, um, when, um, when somebody is actually talking safety for themselves, which I-I hear you"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"So, what does staying home look like for you. Is that something that-- You know, you- You talked about drinking at an event. Would staying home be--"
"Well, Super Bowl is coming up, and that might be an opportunity where, you know, I might-- I might-- see myself maybe drinking that day"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"So, maybe I should just, uh, I think I'll just have people come over to my place instead of going to another"
That would work for you?
"Yeah, I think so, and probably a smarter thing to do. Yall know I'm not going through this again"
"Yeah, yeah."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Uh, so, uh, would people come and drink at your house, and then be okay with that?"
I'm thinking so.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"So, an event at your house."
There you go.
"Yeah, good. Good. That sounds good. Mike, has there even been, um, a time in your life when you thought about, um, not drinking at all?"
"I did, uh, for about 6 months for my first DUI, and I'm not drinking again. And, um, I-I just didn't think that, um, I really had a problem with it, so, you know, I-. But, again, it wasnt uh-- You know, it was a bit different last time, because I was drinking a bit more than, y. I quit for 6 months, so I kinda knew that I'm not a real alcoholic, you know, and, after that,"
Right. Right. Right. 6 months. 6 months. 6 months. Thats long.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
What was it like to be this 6 months like
"Um, I know that was kind of strange. I really didnt hang out with my friends enough to not be a real one. Um--"
Friends? Friends? Friends? Friends
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. uh oh you know me, huh."
"Whi-which? Whi-which. Which friends were these if you didnt mind me asking. Im not getting too personal but, the friends that normally drink with you or just your-"
"No, my friends."
-social circles. okay. ok. ok.
"Just my social circle, I suppose, uh--"
Wha-wha-what do you think made-made-them n-not hangin' out with you?
"Probably 'cause I didn't- I wasnt drinking with them, I guess. I'm not really sure. I mean, it seemed, uh--"
Did you ask them?
"Um no. No no no no no no. I really couldnt because my girlfriend really wouldn't let me hang with them. You know? You know. I mean, that was, uh, she said that if I, yall, kept hanging out with these guys, that she ain't with me anymore. And I just thought that it was better for me to, you know, calm down for a bit and, uh, maybe things would get"
And your girlfriend is important-
Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure
-and that relationship was important
"Well, it was until she left, you know."
"Yeah, at the time it was important."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Is this-- Why would she leave?
"Uh, she left when I started drinking again."
"Ahh, after the 6 months."
"She, uh, you know, it kinda, I dunno, she just said that it's not gonna work out, and, uh, she decided not to continue with"
"Oh, okay. That's okay. So-so, um, youve started drinking again, and then she left?"
"Uh, it was about the same time. I honestly dont know which came first. Same time. About the same time. Uh, we've been getting in a lot of arguments. Just didnt quite feel myself. You know, I-I-I wasn't-- My friends weren't around. Uh, uh-- You know, I missed going out with them."
Did you feel isolated?
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I, uh, just, uh, didn't know what to do all the time, and, uh, you know, I, uh, just, uh,. So, pretty much, we both decided, you know, that it just wasn't the right thing to do, so"
"And, so you are- you are an independent man-"
Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure
"-and, no one is telling you what to do."
"Well, I guess. Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah."
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, uh, so, you started drinking again, and that was-- If you could just give me a rough timeline of how long ago that was, that-"
"[clear throat] well, here we see. The first one was, uh, 3 years ago, and then, um, this one was a few weeks ago, so, uh,"
Absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Its been a while
"In what ways has, uh, drinking, um, sort of, uh, been going on since those couple of years, and then-"
"I'm not really sure that I can really compare good or bad. I'm just, uh, drinking to be social, you know, I don't know that it really changes anything about me. Just, uh, drinking to be social, yall."
"Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. And those friends that werent hanging around with you, did they come back?"
"Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I could go out with them again as soon as my gf left, you know. [laughter]"
Did they not get along with your girlfriend?
"Well, she didn't want me to go out with them."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
She thought they were really--
She was separate then from your other friends and-
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-those relationships just didnt come together?
"She blamed the first DUI on them. I was out with them, she said, because I was out with them, that's pretty much, you know, they-they-"
And what do you think?
"I'm thinking she was right on that one. Yeah, absolutely."
"So, you-you--"
"I mean, if they wouldn't have given me those shots, you know, towards the end of the night, I'd be all. I could have driven, and I wouldn't have, uh- I wouldn't have hit that mailbox."
If they didnt- if they didnt give you those- those shots would have been fine. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Oh, so, the-the-mailbox, where did that come in. That was the-"
That was--
-first DUI that got you.
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I was on-- It was like I was a few blocks away from the house and I, uh, rolled up on the neighbor's lawn and"
That must have been terrifying
I'm not too sure about that night.
"Lol, that was blackout type?"
"Uh, I'm not sure if I was blacked out but I just don't remember a lot of it."
Right. Right. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
I wouldnt really call it a blackout. Im just not that-
"Oh, okay. That's okay."
-remember how that happened.
I-I'm sorry. I'm-. I'm not assuming that-
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-that was blackout that-- Forgive me for that.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's all good.
"Um, so, that was sort of after that the girlfriend-- Your girlfriend, I don't know, well, her name. Um, your girlfriend has decided-- mailbox and she's--"
"Yeah, Mary-Mary, just [crosstalk] Well, after I got the- the-- After I hit the mailbox-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"-um, I stopped drinking for, y'know, like, 6 months, and, uh, y'all, and, uh, we were trying to work things out, but it"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-it just didnt work.
Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh
At that point I think she became possessive
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I felt like she was the only person that, um, you really needed in your life, you needed your friends and--"
"Um, I think she just wanted to control me and I was tired of being controlled."
"Nobody likes being controlled, uh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, and, in what ways, well, did you feel that, um, at any time, did you feel controlled by your friends. You said they-they made you drink those shots. Thats-that sounded like maybe you felt a bit controlled. But-- [crosstalk]"
"Nah, I was-- They just-- No, they weren't- they weren't really controlling me. They just-- They shouldn't have given me the last couple shots, cuz yall, they- they- they- they- they- they-. So-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"-you know, when they- when they- when they- when they- when they- when they- when they- when they-"
"Right, they weren't looking out for your best interests at that point."
"Pretty much, pretty much."
And then sent you out in your car.
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I guess that was my decision to take the, uh, other shots, but I-I just-- I-I just. I-. I really dont remember too much"
This is a hindsight again.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You can blame hindsight a bit. I mean, that works for me. [laughter]"
"Hindsight? No. Oh, yeah, they'll-- it'll take the blame. Um so, you still-- Do you still, uh, drink, and then, uh, the second DUI, what--"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [crosstalk]
Same type of situation. [crosstalk]
"I mean, they were my friends since, yall know, uh, high school, so"
"So, they're important to you?"
"Yeah, absolutely."
"Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And-and sometimes, um, people have friends who are friends but then theres friends who would stay in our lives. So, these would be your constant core--"
"Sure, absolutely."
"Yeah, okay."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Have you ever had, um, interest outside, um, the social drinking, the friends, um, like, what do you do when you"
"Uh, well, like I'll do stuff around the house, you know, uh, cut the grass and stop, do yard work, other than that"
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And any other relationship, if you dont mind me asking-- [crosstalk]"
"Uh, no, I'm single now so, you know, I'm not really, uh-- [crosstalk]"
How did that happen?
"Its all good, yall. I date a bit but, uh, yall just dont wanna get serious right now."
"Oh, so, what does serious look like. Um--"
"Um, I'm just not dating anyone in a regular basis. Im honestly not in a committed relationship anymore. I really feel like I want to be in a relationship"
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Thats all well, yeah. That's good. That's good. It sounds like you know yourself pretty well"
"Sure, absolutely."
"okay. ok. ok. Right. Right. Right. We-we are watching, um, your second DUI and, um, well, so, Mike, if you don't mind me asking, what would you do differently,"
"Well, I think I'd like to really think about--"
Since the co- the court sent you and we have to sort of explore what would have happened if you went out and did this
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I, uh, wouldnt drink as much as I would have, and if I- if I did, I would call, uh, a taxi or, uh, get some kind of"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Is there anyone that you could call?
"Uh, I'm not really considering that. I guess I would have to think about that, because if I was going out and drinking, I would have. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah."
Right. Right. Right.
"I guess I could call it taxi cab or something, idk"
They will come.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm thinking that'll be something.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They will come. They will come and get you as long as you got the money. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm thinking maybe if I take some money I'll put it like in my wallet-
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"-and I'll put it in there for emergency, and that way, I'll have money. I can just call a taxi, and use that money to get home in case I get drunk."
"Oh, so, when you use your-your-bar money, it would be somewhere else?"
What is this? Is this a thing?
"Your bar money would be somewhere else, not in your wallet?"
"Probably in my front pocket, I suppose."
"There you go. Oh, yeah. Okay. So, y-yeah. Thats it. Thats the"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Thats makes a lot of sense. So then you'd have your money tucked away someplace different.
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, if I put, uh, if I put, then I wouldn't spend it though, you know, [unintelligible 00:18:48]"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
There-there would be a plan that I would have to-
Sounds like a good plan.
-to get home. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, uh, how often do you think you'll need that plan in the--"
"I would probably have thought, 'cause I-- Like I said, I dont really think I have a problem with, uh- with, uh- with,. Just-"
Right. Right. Right.
"-think that, you know, that was an isolated incident."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"And-and I, uh, just, uh, you know,"
"And then-- Oh yeah, and also you said if you had people, uh, you drink for the Super Bowl. Is this Super Bowl?"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Sorry, I'm not a football fan but this is Super Bowl coming up, right?"
"Yea, well, gotta have some people over at the Super Bowl, yall know that"
"So, you'd have them in and, um, I just want the folks who are leaving your house, would--. Sometimes designated drivers I--"
"Im really not hanging out with people that drink a lot though. I mean, they are-they arent-they arent-so-like-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-"
"So, it would be up to them?"
"Sure, I'd think, yeah."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Sounds like you have-- You thought about this, and you- You are willing to put some things in place, the- wallet, um, money in the"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Have folks in to-to socialize for an event, and that you still have your-your-social-- Your friends and your core group and-. What was the 6 months of not drinking like for yall. If you were to choose not to drink."
"Yall know this was a- it was, uh, pretty good. Just didnt feel like I had my friends around, and-and it just-seemed kinda boring. I felt good physically and so forth, but, uh, you know, I, uh, just, uh, I was more on time to work, I. Just kinda--felt isolated. I'm just not- I just didn't feel comfortable, you know."
"6 months is a- is long. Um, Try to think back, were there other people. Was it- was it just you?"
"Well, my- my girl- my girlfriend and I were trying to work out at work and it was. But it just seemed like we were arguing all the time, you know. Just didnt seem like-- You know what I mean. I liked the not-drinking part, but it just didn't seem like anything else has changed."
Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok.
You know. You know.
"So-so, if you werent to-- If you were to go with the plan of maybe not drinking, which you mentioned-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"-um, uh, your girlfriend Mary is-is not a part of your life-"
No-
-right now.
-and I really dont see that working out really well
"Would there be something else that would, um, sort of, fill in that-- The-friends area, do you think?"
"Well, I'm not sure. I mean, its a-- I mean, my friends drink though so. 'Cause it's kinda hard to be with them, and then--when I'm not drinking, 'cause it's-- I just don't feel like I fit in, ya know."
"But, yeah, I-I see what-you say, for sure. Um, there-there are those friends that drink but not that much, I heard you say"
"Yeah, they dont drink that much, but they-seems to-they-drank-like-them-though-"
Mm. the mf. Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure
"I mean, its just beer. You know-"
Right. Right. Right.
-it's not like they drink whiskey or anything like that. It's--
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So--
"But, they'll drink beer, and it's just-- You know, for me, I don't know. Sometimes, uh, I dont-- You know, I have an intention to have a few drinks and maybe I do, you know-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"-and then I dont know what really makes a-a legal limits. So, I think I can drink what. Is this what it is? Like 2 or 3 drinks per hour?"
"Um, 1 drink per hour."
"One drink per hour, okay."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
I need to remember that. [Laughs]
Or one shot or-
"Yeah, One shot."
-One glass of wine or one beer.
okay. ok. ok.
Um-
Just one though?
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
That's it. That's the tweet.
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, the idea of, uh, having the friends and not drinking, is that something that i--"
"Yeah, I guess. I-I think I know a few friends that arent drinking and I dont really, uh, probably,"
"Then, who are- who- who are they?"
I would have to really think about that. Im not too many good friends. I'm a few of you know that I have some acquaintances that don't drink but-
Would it--
-pretty much everyone I know like drinks.
"Yeah, so wha-what would--what would you think it would do to the relationship of you not drinking but still being with the-these"
"Yeah, I, uh, uh, uh, uh"
Would-would it work out and--
"I'm not sure. Just weird, I- I think that, you know, kinda when I go around, you know, and- hang with them at all, it's, uh--"
This is uncomfortable.
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly, exactly."
What makes this uncomfortable?
"Well, 'cause they drink and then- and if I drink soda, they kinda mess with me a bit."
"How-- So, messing with you would be like what?"
"Well, they're just messing with me until I get-- You know, until I drink a beer with them, you know. So--"
"Oh and-and-and-oh, I see, yeah."
"Just- you know, I mean-"
"Yeah, like sorta-"
"-they just kinda like egging me on, idk"
"Lol, yeah."
"I really dont feel like being an outcast, you know what I mean, theyre my friends, you know. I--"
"Right, so you make--"
"I was with them since, yall know, like high school. So, I can't."
Mm-hmm and-
"I mean, they mean a lot to me."
"- it's [unintelligible 00:24:05]. I know you, um, value friendship and-and friendship is so important, uh, and, I just wonder how"
"I guess maybe hanging with them for a bit would probably not be a bad idea, I guess. Yall know I mean I- I- I- yeah."
And see what happens.
"Yeah, sure. gu- i think that would be something i could probably try"
"Yeah- yeah, how important would that- would it be. Zero being not so important and 10 being pretty important that you--"
"Well, if I need to get my license back, I think it would be pretty important for me to stop hanging around with them for a while"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. okay. ok. ok. [unintelligible 00:24:52] something you would willing to try. okay. ok. ok.
"Yeah, absolutely."
That sounds--
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Well, maybe that's something that we could talk about next time if you- if you want to"
"Yeah, yeah."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"That would be a good idea I think. Uh, is this gonna help like get my license back, like, at this-- Like, at this--"
"Well, I sure-sure would, um, tell the-people who-who need to know-"
okay. good. good. good.
"-about the plans that you strive for. Um, that I-- There would be, um, someone to read this assessment-Mm."
"-and then, um, and then it would be up to you mostly. The choice is-is completely yours. And, um, it sounds like to me that there's no reason why you wouldn't be able to do this. You gave me a lot of thought, and you have some plans in place, and anything else that you might come up with, uh, to help"
"Um, probably just not really drinking as much as I do. I mean, if I'd just not drink, I wouldn't have to really worry about that either."
Then you wouldn't have to worry.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Yeah, because worry is no fun."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This is so true. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. Well, thank you Mike. This is what I appreciate"
okay. ok. ok. Thank you. You are welcome.
Thank you. You are welcome.
Good morning Mary!
Fine. Fine. Fine. Where do you want me to sign?
"Well, you can sign right here. Seems like you arent in the mood to talk today"
Not really. Not at all.
"okay. ok. ok. Yall know this sounds like yall had uh, a day at school. I've noticed that uh, you missed your first hour of class today as well as"
"Yeah whatever. Just, yeah."
Doesnt-isn't really concern you at this time of year?
"Its just like the same thing every day like, I really dont know why. Like um, so I signed your paper, why are all these questions asked me"
"So yall kinda wondering what the point of these visits are, me coming to your house"
Yup. Yup. Yup
okay. ok. ok. Would it be okay if I kind of explained again kind of what this program is about?
I guess so.
"Stopping every day just to make sure that you are here and following and-reacting to your GPS and making sure that. I kinda just get to know you as well when I come for these visits 'cause, um, you know that's kind of my role as your caseworker"
So yall just wanna know my business?
I think at times I'm sure it does kinda come off as nosy
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Some clients struggle with understanding that I really do care about you. I know that. And you know that when we first met that you had expressed a goal of, um, getting off this program as fast"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
So I know just kinda being here when you need to be here is one way of doing that
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
Yet you still seem to be annoyed that this is something that we still have to do.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean I guess I can be here if I have to but I can't make any promises that I wont leave
So you still kinda feel like you won't be able to do this successfully?
Nah cuz this just kinda feels like why you need to know my business. Why do you care?
And I'm sure that does seem confusing too 'cause I know that you have a lot of other people involved in your life right now
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
I think its pretty overwhelming
It just looks like a lot.
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
And you feel like theres all these rules
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And theres also the fact that at times it is and I think its really struggling at times too
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Um, and I know some clients have expressed just really valuing their freedom. They didnt realize how much they really valued that until it was gone."
"Right, the only thing that I wish I had now"
Your freedom? Your freedom? Your freedom
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
What would be some ways you could go about being able to get your freedom back?
I guess like your sign your papers
"Mm-hmm yup that one step, just sign the papers when I come around. Even tho it seems kinda annoying at times, it is something that we are contracted to do."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
What are some other ways you feel you can get your freedom back?
Not do this again so that I never get stuck in my house and be stuck in my business and all of these ppl coming
"So, that's something that will motivate you to not do what you did, not commit that crime, and, um, 'c"
Yup. Yup. Yup
"Thats okay. Well, I know that you are making an effort. I'm appreciating then and when- I do stop by that you still sign the paperwork even though you feel like it's annoying at times. So, thank you for, uh, at least doing that."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"okay. ok. ok. Um, before I leave today is there anything else you want to add or-or need to share with me?"
Not really. Not at all.
"Okay, well just so yall know, again, I'm back so I can see you later today then"
Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok.
Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok.
Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye
For me. For me. For me
"So, um, we'd like them to pick at least 3 goals that they would like to work on in the next 30 days. Because what we will do is monitor you and check in 30 days to see how you are going with your goals. So with that being said, we want you to pick something that is relevant for you, something that you are willing to work on. So with that being said, is there anything that you would love to change your work at either home or school, um, [unintelligible 00:00:30]?"
"Um, gotta start getting my school on time for my first hour of school. Always miss that class"
Ok so for you getting on time for first hour is something you would love to work on the next 30 days?
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes
okay. ok. ok. What a goal. Brilliant. So why make this goal for yourself
"Uh, so people can get off my back."
And who are these people?
"My mom always says get to school, get to work. My PO will be like, you know, if you dont get the school on time, I can bring you back in for sanctions and"
So that's something you definitely avoid?
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes
okay. ok. ok. So getting to school for your first hour of school is something that you go to work on as your goal
I'm going to try.
So what are some specific steps you would need to take to get to school on time for first hour?
"Cant ever get up in the morning. So this is hard and then by the time I get up and get dressed, I miss the bus. So then I usually end up walking or seeing if I can find a ride. So this could be a bunch of different reasons why Im late"
"Okay, so it's not just one major thing?"
No. No no no no no
"So knowing that a few things can really get in your way, what would work best for you to get to school on time. What do you know you need to do?"
I would probably have a good start making me get up on time
What time would you need to get up then?
"I need to catch the bus I probably need to be up at 6:15 and sometimes that's just so hard, 'cause I go to bed so late"
So you still kinda doubt this is something you could do yet you say you really wanna do it because you don't go back for sanctions
Right. Right. Right. Could try-
okay. ok. ok.
- and see how it goes.
"Okay, so you're willing to at least try it?"
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes
So what time would you have to get out of bed at night to make sure you wake up at 6:15pm?
Im going about midnight now so if I tried maybe 11:00 I wouldnt be up. Can try 11pm
okay. ok. ok. Okay so youre willing to go to bed at 11pm and then set your alarm for 6:15 the next morning?
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes
When would you start this?
"Uh, either tomorrow or the next day."
"Okay, so if I would write this here, um, what would you want me to write- what would you want me to write. Tomorrow or the next day?"
Lets start tomorrow
"Tomorrow. Tomorrow. Oh, cool. Great. So who would be able to help you get to bed on time and make sure you wake up at 6:15pm?"
my mom. my mom. my mom
your mom. your sister. your mother
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
okay. ok. ok. Anything that your mom could do to help you with that?
she could come in and wake me up and remind me that i said to you that i was going to get up so that
"So its almost like you want your momma to make it say this for you. Because your mom makes you get up like you want your mom to remind you, ""Hey, remember this is something that you want for yourself""."
Exactly. Exactly. Yup. Yup. Yup
Awesome. Great. What could possibly get in your way that you dont get up by 6:15pm?
[sighs] not going to bed on time
Not getting out of bed on time
"Yup, thatll be a struggle"
okay. ok. ok. So if you feel tempted to stay up later-
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
- how could you respond instead?
"Just get out of bed and turn off the lights, dont have my phone on"
Okay so a phone is a distraction for you. So keeping your phone away-
Lol. Yeah.
- and even actually turning the lights off and making sure that it's dark?
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes
Kinda a reminder that its time to get out of bed
Have my mom check on me to make sure everything is put away
"Also, the support from your mom too."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
Awesome. Great. So how will you know that your plan works?
"When I get off work on time, when the bell rings and I get in class."
"So for you being in your class, when that bell rings then you know, this is the goal."
Absolutely. Absolutely.
"So what Ive been hearing so far- what again, what a goal. You already have some insight on how to do this. So for you, it really means getting to your first hour because you dont want to go back to sanctioned days. You already have a plan of going to bed by 11pm, turning off the lights, putting your phone down. Even the support from your mom is really gonna help you get up at 6:15 in the morning with that alarm. I know that sounds really early in the morning but you seem willing to do it. And if you cant do this your momma help you out as well"
"Oh, yeah, I hope so."
What a great plan and you said you were going to start tomorrow
Ill give it a try.
"Awesome. Great. Well, thank you."
You're welcome.
So what happened?
"Just want my call, that's it, that's the tweet."
"Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. Yeah, I was told that phone calls were taken away"
[scoffs] yeah.
What-what happened?
"I'm not sure. Some of-- One of the officers, it's like he has it out for me or something. I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I. Something about me not making my bed, something about my attitude. Idk man, just want my call"
"okay. ok. ok. weird when I, uh, got that report because for the most part since you got here, uh, model-model resident,. So, uh, is it something to do with you getting out in 3 weeks. This must be pretty hard"
"Im just trying to get in touch with my mom, thats it, thats the"
"Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. Yea, youve used to have your mom contact, almost every other night and now for just about a week, you ha. I can imagine being pretty difficult. I remember you saying something about like your dad's birthday coming up?"
My dad is turning 2 tomorrow
okay. ok. ok.
Also just wanted my call so I can talk to my mom. That's it. That's the tweet.
"Um, a long time and this is basically the first time that we've seen this behavior from you, so I know for a lot of other guys. So is this something you might be doing?"
Hi. Nice to meet you. You're [unintelligible 00:00:02]?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"okay. ok. ok. Um, what brings you in?"
"Well, I have to come to learn about my-- how to manage my diabetes. Just got diagnosed."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. I see- I see that your A1C or your blood glucose is high.
"Yeah, that's what doctor said. She-she really laid into me about that. Said it was-- I guess, this is serious stuff. I was talking about losing eyesight, mm, my feet, mm, problems with a lot of other stuff, and it really scared me. Uh, so, [sighs] you know, how- to manage all this, I guess, is what I gotta learn, but it just sounds massive"
"Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. Well, you're doing need to take your medicine. Uh, you know, need to start dieting, uh, you know, lose some weight, change your eating habits, exercise, uh, to get your diabetes under control"
"Huge amount of stuff to do and, I can't- I can't believe I can do all that, and on top of that, it"
"So, it can be."
[sighs]
"So, uh, you know, we-we need to start looking at doing all those different things to get your diabetes under control 'cause your-"
"Well, I-I [unintelligible 00:01:35]"
"Good morning again Mr. Green. Its really nice to see you again. We looked at your results here and you had impaired glucose tolerance and your cholesterol is up a bit too much, your. So today, we meet up to talk through some of the things that you could do for yourself that might improve the situation. And as you know, there are all types of things that can affect your health. So can we just have a general chat but how are you getting on?"
"Well, I suppose you can give me a row and tell me it's all self-inflicted and I have to change my ways and"
"Actually, I won't because you are the boss. Its up to you what you want to do with you about your own health."
The doc said I need to take pills for the rest of my life
You're not too happy about that
"Well, I'm feeling fine, but the-the-doc said it could save my life."
"Well, there are many things you can do yourself that will improve the situation as well. So what we can do today is wee up some of these things, smoking, diet, exercise, weight, loss, all those types. So we just gotta start and see how you feel as we go"
"Okay, what should I do first?"
"Well, it is very much up to you, you are the boss of your own life. Where would you like to start?"
Where should I start?
"Well, I could give you my opinion. Um, and I can give you lots of information, but I think you know the score pretty well. And I think you would know what I would say"
"Yea, u say, stop smoking and lose weight and take more exercise, huh?"
"Absolutely. Absolutely. Spot on. Well done. So stopping smoking would have a huge impact, that would have a huge impact very early on. Losing weight would also have a huge impact because that would help with your blood pressure, your cholesterol, and also lower your diabetes. So what-what'd you think of those things. Uh,"
"Uh, I loved to lose weight but it's so hard giving up the things you enjoy."
"It’s really tough. It's hard to know where to start, isn't it?"
"Really should. Or shouldnt I,"
How important is it to lose weight then?
"Well, I would like to see my children settle and my grandchildren grow up and I should,suppose I should be an example"
So can it be in there for your-your-family's important to you?
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. I wanna be there for them but not a burden to them.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So w-where can you start with that?
"Uh, Ive been thinking about them a lot lately, and I want to be there for them. So have to do what I need to, to improve my health."
What kind of first thing might you consider doing?
"I could cut down on my drinking to start with, you know. Um, that's adding to my weight and to my blood pressure, isn't it?"
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That would be a really good place to start, mm-hmm"
"Honestly, I think I'll try and cut out the booze altogether. My wife says I drink too much at the weekends"
So I think that should be really supportive then
And I suppose I could cut out crisps and pies at work.
So what would you do to make sure you didnt get hungry at work?
I need to start having soup at lunchtime. I suppose a big bowl of soup would be far better than two whole pies.
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, a big bowl of vegetable soup. I mean, you could probably count that as one or maybe even two of your 5 a day. So it would be a really good place to start. Anything else you could think about doing?"
"Well, there's one, one thing uh, I already did, I stopped adding salt to my food. My blood pressure was so bad that doc said that would help"
"Well, that's good. Thats probably beneficial to you already. Also, the other thing you might not know is that salt intake is linked to losing calcium from our bones, which makes the. So reducing your salt intake will really help with that too"
"Well, I didnt know that. Um, it's good to know. I'll tell my wife, um, she still loves her salt and her mother has osteoporosis."
"So well, maybe you can help her as well and that would be good. Well, Mr. Green, I think you have off to a really great start. You know what you- you need to do, and you clearly thought about it and got some good plans in place. So you can reduce your-your alcohol intake, youve already started by reducing your salt intake. Um, maybe when we meet up next time we could talk a bit about smoking and exercise as well, when youre ready. So how are you feeling now?"
"I say with the cut down on the pies, crisps, um, and cut out the booze, I feel I make a start but let. But, uh, the next day when we look at it, the figures might be a lot better."
That's awesome. So should we meet up at the same time next week then?
"Yes, that’s fine with me."
Thats awesome. All the very best then.
Thanks. For the follow. You too. You too.
"Uh, welcome. And, uhphalous"
Thank you. You are welcome.
I would say my name is Mark and I work at Green Prescription Drugs. And-
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
I know a bit about you from the referral letter from the doctor.
From my GP? No.
"From your GP, yeah."
Uh. Thats not true.
I'll probably want to just ask you a bit about what led you to come here today and get an idea about
What led me to this?
Mm. the mf.
My GP. My GP. My GP
And what did he have to say?
"Well, um, you know, I've had my sort of, uh, checkup."
mm. this is a good one
"And apparently, I might have diabetes 2. Well, that's what he says."
Right. Right. Right.
"Um, I-I think I feel perfectly well. I-I understand people with diabetes are a little bit plumper than I am. I-I understand that."
Mm. the mf.
"But, um, that's really why I'm here. Almost. I'm on his command"
"Right, so he kinda gave you a directive?"
"Well, he did. Says he put me on some sort of program if it gets worse he will be in jail"
Mm. the mf.
"But as I say, I-I feel absolutely fine now."
"So this kinda came out of nowhere, feelin' okay"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Go for this checkup with the doctor. And he says, ""You have Type II diabetes."""
"Mm, very surprised."
Mm. the mf. Came out of the blue for you?
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. I'm thinking this did.
Mm. the mf.
Mm. the mf.
And you said you kinda dont fit that kinda Type II diabetes look. That kinda got you this idea-
I-
-you were-
Thats what I understand
Mm. the mf.
"And you know, and I'm not overweight."
Mm. the mf.
"I-I sort of look after myself to a limited extent in that way. Um but I'm a busy person, I suppose I burn off the calories. And-"
Mm. the mf.
"I'm not sure, really."
Mm. the mf.
My lifestyle considerations
"Hmm. Interesting. So it doesnt quite fit in your head, Type II diabetes and-"
No. No no no no no
-your lifestyle?
"Nah, not at all."
Comes as a huge shock. And what was your reaction when he said that at the time?
"Well, I-I thought he must be joking. To be honest. thinking about-"
Mm. the mf.
-Why you are-- Look around you.
"Mm, mm. Thats it, thats"
"um, just felt that, um-- I mean, I don't think he was wasting my time because why would he?"
"Yeah, yeah."
Right? Right? Right?
He has a lot to do.
Um-- Absolutely right.
Mm. the mf.
"He needs to get a job. And obviously, the tests have come through. And I got these diabetes 2 signs"
Right. Right. Right.
"Right? Right? Right. Um, I'm just going to say, I just don't feel like this-- Well, I just don't feel"
Mm. the mf.
Umphaloid
So how are you feeling in your head-
I'm feeling absolutely fine.
-and what the tests say kinda like dont join up.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I feel absolutely fine physically
Mm. the mf.
I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-
Hmm. Interesting.
"I mean, I'm getting around, sleeping pretty well-"
Hmm-hmm. Thats a good look
sort of you know-
Hmm. Interesting.
- I am- I am compos mentis. So I'm not Goldberg III diabetic diabetic
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What is the problem. Mm. the mf.
What is the problem?
"And how did this happen is probably kinda what you think too. Well, how did this--?"
"Well, uh, yes. I mean-"
Mm. the mf.
"-I must admit, I havent done too much research. I was busy."
okay. ok. ok.
"Um but he-he was saying something about, I dunno, family or whatever. I'm not sure."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
And I'm not sure that's hereditary.
Mm. the mf.
I think he said something about it being hereditary
"So he mentioned, might be a family thing. And so you-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-maybe got from your parents or something of the sort.
"Yeah, that could be-"
Mm. the mf.
"-because, um, my mother mentioned-"
Mm. the mf.
"-that, uh, daddy had diabetes-"
Right. Right. Right.
"-diabetes 2. And if I think about it, um, his brother-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"-uh, havent seen him in years"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
But he might have it because he is-
Mm. the mf.
-pretty cuddly guy. You know-
Right. Right. Right.
He's pretty big.
So fits the picture-
"Well, yes, the stereotype,-"
"-when you think about what he-he-- Yeah, he's stereotypically."
"Yeah, I guess."
"A bit bigger, perhaps doesnt look after himself that well, and fits that foot"
"Yeah, yeah. Well, yeah. I mean, as far as I know, I havent seen him for-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-I'm not sure how many years.
Mm. the mf. So you got this knowledge as a witness there are some family history of diabetes in the past?
"Apparently so. Yes, apparently so."
Doctor mentioned that as being a factor.
"Mm, is hereditary, isnt it?"
"That's certainly true. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. We know that people who have had parents or have been in the past, there is a hereditary factor or genetic factor in-income"
"Genetic factor. And so, does that mean that if you have, um, if you have a history of this within your family-"
Mm. the mf.
-if it's a gene-- you get more than likely than not getting it?
Correction. Correct. Correct. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Also, it constitutes"
But it's not inevitable.
Right. Right. Right. okay. ok. ok.
Because its genes or the-the-hyundered factor is not the only factor that causes it or is involved in it happening to you. So other factors come into play.
I bet you tell me what they are
"Well, you mentioned some of the things you know, and one of those is hereditary factors. You mentioned that doctor. And what else do you know or have you heard. Well, you say you havent had a lot of time to do the research. What else? Nothing else. Other things you have."
"I honestly dont know to be frank, Mark. I mean, honestly, I'm not sure what causes this because I've never had any reason to. This came on from GP and it took me back to the office."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Um, the hereditary thing I thought, well, maybe that explains it."
Thats makes some sense
"And why go any further, it exists"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Can't help it.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"They're living pretty long, doing, all the same."
They've managed with that.
Relatives relatively went into their 70s.
"okay. ok. ok. If you'd like to know a bit more about some of the factors involved in time Type II diabetes, I don't know."
Well. Thats. Okay.
If that would help.
"If something that you think that-- Yes. Yes, of course."
I may have shared with you what I know from working with other people and some of the things I experience.
okay. ok. ok.
"And see what you make of it. See if it fits a bit more with where you are. We know that there is a strong family factor or hereditary factor, so that's one aspect. So also, it tends to happen a bit later in life, rather than something you might get when youre a teenager, this type of diabetes. So-so its a later onset. It takes a bit of time to develop maybe. And the main reason I think, um, the primary aspect of it, have you heard of insulin"
I heard about it yeah
"So this is a hormone or chemical, it allows you to utilize sugar in your body."
Right. Right. Right.
"Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. And Type II diabetes typically people have insulin resistance or insulin resistance to insulin in their cells, in their fat cells or their muscle. They can't use insulin. And so sugar builds up in your system."
Are you saying that they-they like they can't digest insulin or is that just a fact?
"You need insulin in your cells, individual cells in muscle or in fat or wherever to, um, use up excess sugar or to"
"Oh, I see. So-so it's like a-it's like a-it's like a-it"
Thats right. Thats it. That
So insulin you-you.
"Kind of, as your."
You're the bar you draw yourself in.
Yap. Yap. Yap
"Or something, and then what balances that out in the body is the insulin taking off the excess."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Or-or digesting. Should I say excessive sugars?
Thats a good way to think
Is this what happened?
Exactly. Exactly. And what is happening in Type II diabetes is your-your-fat-cells-and-liver-cell-and-muscle-cell. Almost like they said we cant use that
Why? Why? Why? Why
"And if-- Well, there are a number of-- We don't entirely know, there's a lot of research still going on as to how. But what we do know is that, um, one of the key things in managing it is to try and modify, control the amount of sugar"
Right. Right. Right. okay. ok. ok.
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I know that people with Type II diabetes have to look after and have to think if they want to control the amount of sugar that. Too much sugar, and if it cannot be utilized in the blood cell, in the fat cells, or liver cells, and the. And that can cause problems with your circulation. So too high blood sugar and too low a blood sugar can be a problem. So sugar is the main concern in Type II- Type II diabetes. And you mentioned earlier on, a few things that the doctor--. Well, what things did you notice over the-over the last month or so?"
You mean personally?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Well, I didnt know. I mean, the thing is you see that-- I mean, I thought about this a bit and thought, well, over time, if things"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
As you get older.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"I'm not jumping over 5 bar gates like I used to, you know, um, as opposed to, uh, running with the backs now"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"At rugby clubs and-and-such, yeah. And, um, the fish I hook, I don't after the kings anymore, go for the snapper now, it's easier, you know"
Slightly more sedate lifestyle.
"Yeah, absolutely. Just do. You're doing it."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Just do. You're doing it. Um, so you're less demanding, I suppose, on your-on-body, you realize, and don't really want to do these things. Yall let the youngsters get home."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Been there, done that. So you dont really notice. So I'm coming back to this diagnosis I got from my GP and him saying, ""You have diabetes 2,"" well, I should feel"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You should feel like something is really wrong with you.
"Yeah, I mean."
"What-how have you been feeling over the last month. So, you say you are very busy you do a lot of work."
"Yeah, I mean I'm a busy person. Okay? Okay. Okay. Okay. uhhhh my work uh, I work in insurance so I always hop from one place to another place"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Um, I havent noticed."
Mh-hmm. Thats it. That
"I really havent noticed how, um, okay I get a bit--I suppose I get a bit out of breath sometimes."
okay. ok. ok.
"If I rush too much that-that's true. Um, I suppose, um, I'm not going upstairs 2 at a time anymore, I use 1 at a time"
So a bit of sort energy isnt quite there sometimes. The vitality.
"Oh, definitely the energy I have is-is not what I-what I-. I need to get my mind off the business, you know, but I do need to sit back and relax with a cup of coffee, you know, and, uh, things."
"Yeah, Mh-hmm."
"Um, more than I would normally."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"But that would be, that would be about it."
Mh-hmm. Thats it. That
"Um, is this getting worse. I'm not sure. I-I suppose. What worse? What worse? What worse. Is this-is this increasing. Well, to say, I'm not really noticing"
"You havent noticed that. So it's a progressive, you know, you just watched this, as-as you got older, things slowed down. Yall know those activities you use to do but that kinda like what happens."
"Yeah, yeah. Um, at least, that's what I think. I mean I dont know if you tell me that I should be more active or my GP says I should be more active"
Mh-hmm. Thats it. That
"Um, as I say, uh, you know I-I'm not doing any regular form of exercise, I gotta say, not anymore."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Um. Is. That. Okay
okay. ok. ok.
But maybe I-maybe I dont know
"Hmm, a bit of mystery there."
"I mean I got uh, well I- I got a great lifestyle. I mean if it's very-it-is very good. I mean Ive got all my mates down at the rugby club. And I got uh, you know even in the summer when that shit is a bit damn. When I was in rugby I used to coach rugby and I used to coach cricket when I finished. So-so I got the-men in the cricket club, um, for the-for the, uh, for the summer evenings. And, uh, and then, uh, the-then, of course, we got the fishing, and that's all of us combined. We are a big gang, really."
Seriously? Really? Seriously. So what I hear is that there are actually many aspects in your life which are actually good
Lol I think my life yeah. My life is so good
"From your perspective, things are going well?"
"My life is so good, then you turn around and say hey you got-- you- you got ill, you got sick"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This doesnt fit.
"And um no I am not. But you see, he said to me that he put me on some sort of, uh, daily monitoring of, is sugar levels?"
Mh-hmm. Thats it. That
And I need to take regular pills
Right. Right. Right.
"Honestly, the only pills I take are sort of paracetamols."
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. When u get uh, a headache."
"For some head in the morning, yall know."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Um. Is. That. Okay
So the idea of having to test-test your blood sugar and take medications kinda feels off--
Come over. You know.
And yall know that's a bit too-
Life is too short to be a bitch.
Too much. Too much.
You know its the truth
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. okay. ok. ok.
I mean you know CBOED
"And you are here today and that's probably something in you thought well I'll follow this through, you know I'll-. And I just want to know for this session, for the time we have today, there are a number of things we could talk ab. You mentioned a few things about your lifestyle and, um, medication is one thing you were told by the doctor you might need. And a number of things that we could talk about today. Which-which area would you think would be a good place to focus on for you to focus on?"
"Well, there is-there is something that you sort of prompted me to think about, and, um, I split up several years now. And, um, you know we have been married for many many years."
Hmm. Interesting.
"And um, I think she used to look after me because she used to do the cooking and-and-stuff like that."
okay. ok. ok.
And I have to say that I'm not the best cook in the world.
Mh-hmm. Thats it. That
"And being on the run all the time and you know once I get back home, its, you know, time to go rugby. And, uh, I-I do I suppose my food is not as healthy perhaps as it used to be when she. She moved to Hamilton to live with her mother, if youve met her mother, she is a. Anyway, but, um."
"So then, since youve been on your own since youve separated, divorced and youve noticed that the things you eat and how"
Yeah mate and his wife are pretty cool about that sometimes
Hmm. Interesting.
"Because, you know, they will invite me for dinner and so on."
"Yeah, yeah."
"And, yeah, yeah, yeah. I guess, you know, that's when you, well, or whatever reason, split up in life."
Hmm. Interesting.
"You're starting to look at somebody else's home life, you think, ""Hmm, I use d to have this."""
"Hmm. Interesting. Yeah, yeah."
"And you think, "" This is nice food, "" isnt it. And you know."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And your--part of your wife used to do a lot of that for you?
"Oh she would do all the cooking. Yeah, yeah,"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"I mean, never bothered to boil an egg in water, you know."
"And so she would kinda look after what you eat and healthy things that you have, spread in front of you and off you go"
"Totally. I mean, I was just in charge of the wine, yall."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. And now you have to think about what you might eat and sometimes not eat the best
Well I-- This is what I--. Maybe I didn't think about it. Maybe that's the thing.
okay. ok. ok.
Maybe I justphalous
Hmm. Interesting.
Because it-- you know this-- pizza shop just hits different
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"And then there were-- I mean, okay, I admit that lunchtime, occasionally, is uh, I'm hungry and McDonald's is very com"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-or Kentucky Fried or whatever.
"Very appealing, isn't it?"
"Very easy to do. You know. And then, um, then you think to yourself, well. I mean, I do think of myself that maybe I need a few vegetables around here. But then you go outside into supermarkets, you know, and can pick up, uh, your- one of your TV dinners."
"Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm."
So you're bringing those in and you're opening them up and putting them in the microwave and there's vegetables there
"Yeah they look pretty on the plate, dont they?"
"Yeah, it looks- it looks fine, you know, et cetera. So that will happen sometimes if I get a night off. But cooking-wise, no, I havent cooked anything, um, other than boil water for a kettle for a cup o"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-for ages.
They are food choices in what you eat and what your diet it's not what-something you actually had to think about in the past
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Im craving her breakfast. We used to get this kind of breakfast, I gotta say."
So one thing that you noticed is diet and the eating patterns and-
Wellphalous
-when you eat. Thats one aspect. What other aspects do you think you have--would you--?
"Well, I've been quite a heavy smoker, right. I mean, I could smoke a pack in a half day. And I knew that wasnt doing me no good"
Right. Right. Right.
"I mean the thing is when you a-- I mean I always smoke. So, but when you're young and you're a sportsman, you know cardiovascular"
Yall kinda juggle those two things and kinda--
"Well, the two things they're balancing out, you know and everybody else is"
Yall still running and having a cigarette?
"You know you're passing a cigarette down the backline almost, don't you. Just before the game gets Cynthia"
"Hmm. Interesting. Hmm. Interesting. Yeah, part of the culture."
"Yeah, part of the of the of the. And it changed a bit now, because in my day when we played, of course, it was a very much more social game, which was spend-sp"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Thats why you played and it was a big buddy-buddy thing
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
I really thought rugby and cricket were the same thing
Hmm. Interesting.
Um but nowphalous
"But over the years, you actually reduced your smoking or quit altogether or at times?"
"Oh yeah, I-I, yeah. I was getting sorta-- I was getting sorta, you know, wheezy and I thought, ""I'll cut this out."""
Hmm. Interesting.
But I enjoy smoking. I'm really enjoying it. So cut it down to I suppose it's about 10 a day now
"Ok, so you meant to reduce."
"Yeah, yeah."
You've been noticing that it has an impact on your breathing and health isn't it
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
So you managed to reduce your smoking when you related that to your smoking.
"Yeah, yeah. sort of cardiovascular"
So youve made our decision to do that?
"It-it-it-it-it-it-it-it-it-it-it-it-it-. Youve gone so far, why cant you just stop. But I'm not about to."
Hmm. Interesting.
"It's-it's-- I-I enjoy it, umphalic"
"Yeah, and it's hard to get to stop something you enjoy, isn't it?"
"Yeah, yeah. Well, yeah. I mean, the thing is that you get to, you know, you get to, you get to, you get to--when you get down to that,"
Hmm. Interesting.
"I suppose you have to be quite strong-willed, in a way, to be a good person."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"So you say, ""Okay, well, you're not a cigarette unless you have a cup of coffee. [Laughs]"
Hmm. Interesting.
"Of course, that double edged sword a bit, because then I found I was drinking more coffee, you know"
But they go together so well. And sugar in the coffee?
"Lol, yeah. I'm 2 sugars. Couple of sugar in coffee. Yeah, yeah."
Hmm. Interesting.
So we cut that down as I say
Hmm. Interesting.
"But the problem is that coffee, we up to 8 or so, 10 cups of coffee a day now"
"You drink more coffee. So what I heard you say so far is, if I can just start right back from the beginning and you used to come in and sais. You went for-- sounds like you went for just a checkup."
"No, you know, there's a mate down the rugby club, one of the guys down the rugby club, said-"
MIT. for. science.
"-warranty of fitness, sort of thing, you know. And I thought, now that's an idea, not been to one of those in a while"
"Got to check out, why not?"
"So I'm 55, and you're reading in the papers, you know, it's that at 55 you'll--you know, heart disease is more rampant"
Hmm. Interesting.
"-and all these sorts of things that get around this middle age time. So I thought, ""Well, I'll go and have one."". I was very confident when I went along. And honestly, when I went along, I. I thought, you know, the doctor is going to say, ""Hmm, I wish I was as healthy as you,"" sort of"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Um, but unfortunately, uh, he-he came up with this. And its the only thing that comes to mind. I'm thinking-"
So everything else looked pretty?
"My cholesterol is quite good, not too bad."
"Cholesterol good, your weight is good."
Yeah-yeah. Not too bad.
"Um, you're smoking but you managed to reduce that to a smoking session."
"Yeah, I cut it down, yeah. Mind, that's 3 years, I mean."
"And anything else, go tickling down the list. The tire is good, oil good."
Absolutely. Absolutely.
So we lookin' good.
And in the end we come to this-
And ah hang on.
"-too much sugar in the tank, or something. I'm not sure."
"Yeah, there's something wrong with this, uh, with this bit."
"So, yeah."
And it doesnt quite fit with how you see your own lifestyle.
No. No no no no no
"Because you-- it sounds like what you have been doing, you have made some conscious effort to be aware of some of those"
"Yeah, I mean, yeah. I mean, and probably you've heard this before, but the thing is, and I mean, and probably you--"
Mm. the mf.
You shouldnt be smoking.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"And then I think to myself, ""Well, maybe I shouldn't socialize."". And then after that, ""Well, maybe I shouldn't be alive."""
"So like domino effect, and they all just sit-"
You know. You know. Lol what-what is this all about. THIS IS- THIS IS SO MANY PEOPLE'S LIVES
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.
"Well, if it came down to it, then, and some said, ""Well, you can solve this problem by taking a pill once a day, um,. But what I dont want to do, um, the doctor was saying, or insinuating, that I need to change my lifestyle."
A bit broad kind of like you gotta change everything
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, um, and I-I said, well, no. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. [coughs] I dont want to change my lifestyle. I had to get to where I am. I'm reasonably happy. Okay, wish I wasnt separated. Okay, I'm wishing my kids were-were still around, um, yall know. One of them is off now in, um, in-- back in Europe playing rugby in France."
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And your thought was, yeah, right, I hear that but actually, I dont want to make all these big changes in my life"
"Nah, cause I dont feel that I need to, cause I dont feel that I need to."
Feel like you need to. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"I mean, why? It's you know"
Mm. the mf.
"Um, I can't argue with a medical professional, Mark, because I know nothing, you know."
"The test, is the test, and experience, yeah."
"So, I mean, what-what-what-what-what suggestions would you have. I mean- what- what-"
"I'm not sure. I think it depends on where we start, and that's the question that has entered my mind. You mentioned a few things that you already made some effort, or were conscious of. You mentioned the diet, you mentioned your smoking, those are two quite important aspects that we often talk ab"
Is smoking related to diabetes then?
"Yes, it can have an impact. So smoking, um, affects your blood system, so it hardens the arteries, um, and over time, it can have a significant impact on the healing. So people with Type II diabetes, often, if they get a cut, or a bruise, or something, it takes a long time to heal. Smoking reduces the amount of oxygen in your system, so that can further, you know, limit the time it takes your body to heal."
Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh
So we know that smoking and Type II diabetes together-
Dont help. Dont help. D
-isnt a good combo.
"Is it okay to have one without the other. I'm sorry, this is a silly question. [Laughs]"
"Well, the question is, I suppose, that I have for you is, where would you think, for you, would be a good place to start. I mean, even small changes at the beginning, rather than just thinking, oh, I got to change everything, which sounds like you. If you could start with any changes at all, where would you feel most comfortable?"
"Where would I start. Well, I-- What if about if I cut down on sugar in my coffee. If we could have long blacks, no milk, and no sugar."
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm, that might be a start."
I'm thinking I could- I think I could probably handle that
"Hm. Thats a good idea. What we also find is that people make these small changes, small changes, and that starts to kinda-"
Something of a rollover effect.
"-rollover, domino effect starts, and they start looking at other aspects of the game."
"Domino effect, yeah."
"So rather than thinking, ""oh, my, I have to change all these things. I gotta stop smoking, I gotta exercise more, I gotta, you know, start eating more fruit and vegetables,"
How much exercise should I do a week?
"Um, I'm reluctant to give a prescription for that because I think it's really up to you. And I think depends on how things go, as to how much you need to do."
Right. Right. Right.
You mentioned earlier the doctors talking about you monitoring your blood sugar.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"So on how-- It depends on how- how that goes. If you started doing that and do some more exercise, you start having longer blacks, rather than short blacks with lots of sugar. And you get down the sugar and you find your blood sugar starts to come down, then we're headed in the right direction."
Oklahoma on the phone. Combining numbers
"So its really, I suppose, up to how things go for you, and you get that feedback. And if that goes in the right direction, carry on doing and doing some more of that."
"I can forget about everything, for this moment, but cut out the sugar, uh, in the coffee and the milk-- I don't know,. But, um, if we do that, is that where we start?"
Im thinking where we start is where you feel comfortable starting.
"Well, I mean that's something that's not difficult to do."
Apples for breakfast.
"You're starting off with breakfast and getting yourself an apple, bit-a-bit of apple and-so on. Umphaloid"
"So what I hear you are saying is, that there is-- You are now starting to think of some very useful little starting points"
Maybe. Maybe not.
"Not massive changes, but some little things you could do."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"And it kinda dawned on you there may be some possibilities here for making some changes. Lemme ask you this. Um, let's say you put some of these things in place and you start to make some of these small changes."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Um, where do you see that taking you in the next set of 3, 4, 5 years. You know where you want to be in 3-4 years' time. What would be your ideal picture?"
"Well, you know, and this is difficult because I'm not feeling unhealthy now."
No. No no no no no
"So, I suppose it would be fun to-- Maybe I should join a club or two, that's what I'm thinking because I'll be"
Yeah? Oh yeah. You like the social aspect?
"I love the social aspect of it, and, um, there is-there is-there-a-bar in this club as well. I-- Don't- Don't- misunderstand me, I'm not drinking-"
"Nah, I get that. This is what I get."
"-till-- You know, I'm not an alcoholic or anything like that, Iphalic"
"So part of that whole keeping fit and exercise stuff is actually the social side of it, huh?"
"gettin' balance and maybe this is, um, what I actually miss in life, and maybe this is, um--"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"You know? You know. Even after a decent night of sleep, you know?"
Haven't quite that-
And you need-- I get this cup of coffee and maybe I'm responsive to it
And the coffee helps a bit because it perks you up?
And that gets me going. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
And the sugar in it helps too
"Yeah, the sugar gives me the boost, I suppose. I-it was fantastic."
"I hear you hear that your life, your work, your routines are--sometimes you have to keep awake, get up in the morning sometimes and. You need a shot, and then throughout the day you might need just more shots to keep that energy up."
"Hmm. Interesting. If I give up sugar in my coffee, give up milk, black coffees, right?"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"If I find some form of exercise, like squash, I'll do it."
And an activity which has a starting to finish and it's something you do for a slot.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
And then there's maybe some social aspects to it as well
Yeah and thenphalous
Some benefits and some enjoyment that you can see.
"And then, you know, give this, say, 6 months, I don't know what period this would be, then go back to GP"
Thats a great plan.
"And so maybe that would, uh cardiovascular"
"Yeah, sounds like a good idea."
Maybe this is an idea. I mean differentiation
"I'm thinking anything you do, has to be something you decide to do. Just start where you are. You mentioned some really good ideas about possibly getting more exercise into your life, doing something like squash or something. You mentioned some really good ideas about reducing the amount of sugar you-you-you-you intaking during the day, and coffee is a. I think you mentioned that, a bit of fruit, having an apple for breakfast"
"Yeah, like my wife used to. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah."
"Those are some really good ideas and good starting points. So thinking about it like that, what-- Where are you now. What is your-- What-what-where-is-your-thinking-right now?"
"Well, you see, I mean, I'm thinking, ""Actually, this might not be a bad idea this. Nah no I was just joking. Uh but, um, yeah, I mean, why not. Why not? You can do it. Why not? You can do it. This might be fun, it's a new path."
What to lose? Nothing. What to gain? Nothing.
"Well, it would appear that there is something to gain, and--I mean, I-- What do I lose. I'm not sure until I do it. But I think if I do this and do what I enjoy, I wont miss what I do not do. Does this make sense?"
"Yeah, that makes sense"
"Um, yeah, I'm not worried about that. I-- It's not a cardiovascular factor"
"So when you look at it, there's probably more to gain from making these changes than there is to lose."
"I'll talk to Billy about, um, Billy is, um, he's the gym bloke."
Right. Right. Right.
I need a word with him because I'm due down the club tonight.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Seriously. That.
"So you gotta work these things on your mind. You know, the-- And workout where is the place to start."
"Yeah, I think that's where you say where-where you are now, where you're going, where Dana"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-and-and- this is what I have to do. I'm thinking I'm in a rut. I think thats where I differentiation
You were stuck?
"I just-- I'm just- I'm satisfiedly sort-ed, uh, sitting in this- in this rut and, um, that my doctor has actually di-di"
Yeah? Oh yeah?
"-which he says can be managed, and you seem to be insinuating that it can be managed."
"Yes, indeed."
"Uh, maybe this is a blessing, actually-"
So rather than--
"-because I think to myself, ""well, if someday, I'll be diagnosed with diabetes, I just carry on and-"""
Carrying on.
"""-sitting in the corner of a bar, and chatting, and talking and probably getting fat."". I'm not sure, and make it worse. And, yeah, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe."
So it was a- a bit of a shock but now you kinda reflect on it
"Yeah, that's cool."
Maybe this is the-
Thats so cool.
"-bit shake that I needed, yall just be reminding me. I might feel okay. I might-- From my perspective, your perspective, you might think, ""Well, what's the problem. Everything is fine."""
Mm. the mf.
"But now you seem to be thinking, ""Maybe things weren't, or weren't, as good as I thought they were."""
"Yeah, I think you're quite right. I'm thinking you justphalous"
Things could be worse?
"I'm not sure, you're becoming sedentary, aren't you. Nah, this sounds quite exciting. No, actually, this is quite exciting. Quite [unintelligible 00:31:28]"
"Yeah, I can sense that. I can sense that in you that you are--"
"I'm thinking to myself, I think, ""Oh,"" I think gophalic"
Quite invigorated with the idea of--
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Bitch this is- THIS IS- THIS IS- THIS IS- THIS IS- THIS IS- THIS IS- THIS IS-
Making some of these changes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"This is good. This is good. And, umphalage"
You up for the challenge?
"I'm thinking I'm. I mean, I never thought about it, but when I think about it now it's, ""What am I doing here?"". Why am I like this. Why am I just happy contented to drift"
So think about when you were-- This- This is an interesting question to see what you think. You've been- you've been a coach. You-- Maybe you will be a coach again
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"What would you say if you were talking to yourself, if you like, you know, if you were the coach saying,"
Oh so if I was obs-
"Yeah, what-what would you say?"
-observing as it were?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Watching myself, what would I say. I-I-- Well, I would say, are you happy?"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
That-- Are you contented with that performance of you and your team?
"And, I suppose, our own personalized a bit like that, there are lots of different aspects that need tweaking"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Modified and looked at, to get the best out of ourselves, to get the best out of opportunities we have."
"I'm thinking you-. Um-- And again, you're putting them together and it's-it's-becoming-it's-a-one-team-job, isn't it?"
"Yeah, yeah."
"Thats ok, do a bit of this and do a bit of this."
"Some good things I- some things I'm good at and there are some other aspects we think, ""Well--"""
"Yeah but I'm not giving up on anything really, do I?"
It's not about giving up on your personality or-
No. No no no no no
-changing who you are fundamentally.
No it's not. It's not.
"Its just tweaking things. Just fine-tuning a few areas and being a bit more aw-aware of one aspect of your life a bit more, like the food choices or. I really enjoyed listening to your perspective, and your story a bit, and it helped me a lot to get an idea ab. Also-and we also talked a bit about what's going to happen next. And you came up with some great ideas. Things are just going to get better, before all this, before you met the GP, things are just"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"I'm talking about how you felt about that today and it comes along to me. Although, it can be quite a-bit of a shock to be a-bit of a-bit. Not quite fit with how you see things."
True true true true.
"And as we were talking, I can hear you saying that maybe if you looked back to where you were before you. Things werent as good as you think they are."
"Now that I think about it- now that I think about it, maybe."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Maybe they were.
"I think you may have been saying, in your mind, that you could make some of these changes, rather than bring broad-brush,. It is not about changing who you are, it is about changing massive facets of your life, but maybe small steps that need to"
"Yeah, you see differentiation"
What you mean by what those might be.
Mm. the mf. When your life stops-
Mm. the mf.
"-your family splits up, or whatever, and you stop caring, I-I think you stop caring really. Uh yall stop caring about yourself"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Because everything is just f-
Nobody there too.
"Nobody there, [crosstalk] it's true and so,-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"-you know,-"
Mhm. This is a good one
-you're not worried.
So its time-
So that might be [crosstalk]
-thinking about looking after yourself a bit more.
"Maybe, a bit selfish but maybe why not?"
Why not? You can do it.
"Why not? You can do it. Yeah, that's a good idea."
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, we ran out of time but I also want to ask you a final question, where to from here, what's next?"
"Oh right, well, wha-what we talked about. Now, uh, you know, coffee. Right? Right? Right. No sugar. No milk."
You're going to start with that?
I'll start with that.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Um, I'll be, um, I'll be talking to Bill, uh-"
The gym. Thats it. That
-about the gym but-
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"-I like the idea of, actually doing squash-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-or something else-
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-and I will go down to the rugby club and I will- I know that will be accepted. I'll offer my services again because-
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-it was relatively successful.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"And, uhphalous"
"Also, you mentioned you may go and- back and see the doctor and just give him a bit of an update as to-"
"rosstalk] oh, well, well, I didn't- oh, well, I'll go back and say, ""I'll-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-this and this.
Mhm. This is a good one
This is between you and me.
Yep. Thats it. That
Okay? Okay. Okay. Okay.
Its okay. Its okay.
"But this is how I will do it. Okay? Okay. Okay. Okay. And like I said, I will make the inquiries, I will start there-"
Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure
"-I'm gonna give up, uh, I'm gonna give up the V drinks,-"
Mhm. This is a good one
"-I'm thinking, um, look for some better wine. [laughter] Um, and-and I-I would take an interest really."
Youre making a start?
"I'll take an interest in an interest really and- but quite exciting, Mark."
"This is. It is. Well, just to help you, because there are probably other questions you might have, other questions that might come up after this"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-I wouldnt mind if you just- just give me some information that might help-
Not too much.
"Not too much, just some background stuff that might just give you some background info on-"
"Yeah, yeah."
-some of the things that-
"Just give me some background, really."
"-around type- around Type II diabetes and some,-"
Oh yeah and what it is-
[unintelligible 00:36:53] some of that.
"-because I'm not a real person. Yeah, yeah."
"Um, and I'd like to us- for us to meet again, so to catch up with you and make an appointment before you leave. Just to see how things are going and-"
okay. ok. ok.
-see what sort of little changes you managed to make. I would have been really [unintelligible 00:37:07]-
"Wha-what are we talking about, sort of few months down the line?"
It really depends on you. Probably a bit sooner would be good
"What, in about a month?"
That would be awesome.
"Yeah, okay, I'm up for that."
How does that sound?
"I'm up for that. Yeah, now-now that's putting me, um, that's gently putting my head on the block"
Because you dont know the timeline?
"-and I'm not okay with that because, um, yeah, that's cool."
Mhm. This is a good one
"Yeah, yeah. I see you in a month"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
No worries.
"Excellent, superb. Thanks, Mike. [croostalk]"
And I appreciate it. Thank you. You are welcome.
Hi Mr. Stowe.
Hey. Hey. Hey.
How was your day. I'm Bruce Berger.
Pleasure meeting you.
"I, uh, I'm a case manager with your health plan. I understand that you came in today to talk about your diabetes."
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I need to learn how to manage this. Just found out I got diabetes and apparently, it's pretty bad 'cause, uh, she said my blood sugar was sky high, and then laid all these. This just sounds so disastrous and, uh, and then she told me I gotta do all this stuff. And man, just sort of disappointed right now."
"Saw the doctor and, uh, you sound like you just got blindsided, uh, with, uh, not only how, how,"
She mentioned my legs having trouble and-
"And so you really are reeling right now from, uh, all of that. And you sound pretty, pretty scared actually"
"Well, that's, yeah. Its not just being scared, you know. Happens to me but then when I, when-she reels off all these things I gotta do and I'm sorta. So it sorta sits--well, you know, I'm sitting here thinking that, oh my god, this is- THIS IS- THIS IS- THIS"
So this sounds like-
"And it's discouraging, just like discouraging."
"Uh, on top of all the things that can happen in terms of everything that can happen, what worries you also. Cant imagine doing all these things so yall almost feel like all that bad shit is gonna happen"
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This looks like a massive task that I may not be able to handle. And then, yeah, all this horrible stuff happens to me. I mean, it's- it's a bleak-looking situation and a lot worse than that."
"okay. ok. ok. And I-- And what I want to do is help you sort this up into some-some doable chunks so that we can get your blood sugar down. On the other hand, your doctor is right, you know, on the one hand. Your blood sugar is high and we do wanna get it down so that we dont have those consequences happen. Uh, and-and there are a number of things that you need to do in order to-get your blood sugar down. Um, on another note, we can take this a step at a time, so it's not so overwhelming."
"And I wish you all the freedom to tell me what types of things that you can do right now. For example, there- there are basically 3 things that need to be worked out with diabetes. Taking your medicine as directed. And honestly, if I was to work on one thing right away, given that everything seems so overwhelming would probably that-. How-how is this far?"
"Well, not too much trouble in taking the medicines, especially since I understand my blood sugar is high. and-"
So easy to do.
"Yeah, I'm pretty- I'm pretty dope at taking drugs."
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 'Cause it looks like you need to just take your medicine, uh, once a day from- prescription. So this sounds doable right now"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm thinking I could probably do that
"okay. ok. ok. Definitely would have changed your eating habits, you know, to eat- eat healthier, uh, not necessarily less, but. And the other thing would be getting, um, some more physical activity. And by the way, that doesnt mean going to a gym. Thats what means things like more walking, maybe using stairs instead of an elevator or an elevator, stuff like that. Uh. Thats not true."
"Well, she also mentioned monitoring my blood sugar and all this. And just seemed like a lot of mumbo jambo to me"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And thats really giving you feedback on how those other things are doing so that it keeps you on task
"Oh, okay. That's okay."
"When you take your medicine, when you switch up your eating habits, that's really having an impact on your blood sugar 'cause getting your. How does all this-- where does this leave you now right now in terms of how you feel?"
"Well, I like that I, you know, that-that we can do it at a step at a time. I mean, that's--that relieves some pressure."
okay. ok. ok.
"And being able to talk to you and do this as we go along rather than--I-I wasn't certain I could just, wham, put this massive program in. Uh but doing a step at a time and I, you know, that--getting on the medicine, I dont think that is a big problem. Thats pretty sure I can do"
That sounds like you are very committed
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm thinking I could do that. Uh, as long as there are no big-time side effects, but, uh,"
"Well, Mr. Smith, that's your medication sorted out."
Good. Good. Good. Good
Blood pressure is on the high side.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
okay. ok. ok. Wonder if I could raise the subject of your weight.
What? What? What? What
I was wondering if we could spend just a few minutes talking about your weight.
"Are you joking. Look at this, I made time in my day to come here"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
I'm kept in your waiting room-
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-for 45 minutes.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
This is not acceptable.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
You know? You know.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
If I make an appointment with a client for 10pm-
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"-I'm expecting them to start at 10:00, not 10:45."
"Right, and you--so busy enough, and constitutes"
"Yeah, I have other things to do. I have accounts to do."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
I got clients they come in
"Yeah, yeah."
You know? You know.
"And it wasnt essentially easy to make the time come down, and you had to wait in the waiting room, and now I raised the weight"
"Yeah, I mean, okay fair enough, um, I need my blood pressure-"
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"-medication changed but I really havent gotten enough time to talk about my weight yet. I mean, I know my weight."
Right. Right. Right.
"I know the problems, and I also know the solutions."
Right. Right. Right.
"Um, so I'm not really needed to have a discussion, it's- it's just I've got too much to do at the moment, you know?"
Right. Right. Right. And so it-it-it-it-it-it-it-it-it-it-it-
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"And, I- I'm sorry to hear that."
"Well, it's b- it's bad form, you know?"
"Yeah, and that- that's not easy for you, because you- you'd love to spend just a few minutes with me, and"
Yeah but basically I have things to do
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Gotta get back to the office
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
I got a pile of work-
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-that I gotta deal with.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
And every moment out of my day-
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-means that i gotta work in the evening-
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-or the weekends.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's gonna count.
"Well, when you self-employed, you havent got a choice, huh?"
"Exactly, exactly. Exactly. Exactly. Just a couple of minutes."
"Well, I'm here now so yeah, okay, if it takes a few minutes, yeah?"
I'm going to promise.
Okay because I really need to get on
I'd like- I'd just like to simply ask how you feel about this?
"About what-what, losing weight. Well, obviously, I-I want to."
Yep. Thats it. That
"Um, yeah, I mean, who doesnt. I mean, I know that I'm over my, uh, uh, b-b-balance weight, but I now know that it's causing problems. I mean, obviously I get out of breath if I have to do something a bit howering, and I realize that I"
Right. Right. Right.
"-um, and- probably contributing to this."
"Right. Right. Right. So you can see your weight and your health, and you wish things were a bit better."
"Yeah, there are other things, but I mean, yeah, the weight is a- is a- is a- something I'd like to get hold of. You're getting on [inaudible 00:03:17]"
"You could, if you could?"
"Yeah, I mean, I know, um, th- the theories of bit of exercise on a regular basis, um, a. My lifestyle, because of being self employed as an accountant, finding the time, uh, to exercise, but also, finding the"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"-""I need to prepare food."""
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
It often constitutes with me
"Ready meals, and that sort of thing."
"Yeah, yeah. Food on the run, yall know?"
"Oh, yeah. Okay."
Grazing. Grazing.
"Lets see if I can summarise what you said, um, and then we'll see what next. Um, you're leading a busy life."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Um, running a business, and having a lot to do."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You are- you are aware of the- links between your health and your weight, and you are concerned, to some extent,"
"Yeah, I mean, I, to a certain extent, because of my lifestyle, food is just fuel."
"Yeah, yeah."
"You know? You know. Um because I'm juggling all these balls, and I don't want to drop any."
"I'm getting this. I'm getting this. And so, if you could fit it in, you'd love things to be different, but that's not so easy"
No. No no no no no
okay. ok. ok. Can you guys come back and see me in a few weeks time just to chat about this?
"Um, okay, I'm up for that, but itll be the same problem of, A, finding time-"
Right. Right. Right.
"-and B, if I can make an appointment-"
Right. Right. Right. Right.
-Im not expecting to be kept waiting for half an hour-
Exactly. Exactly.
"-or whatever, because it constitutes"
"Exactly. Exactly. I can tell you what might be a nice solution, is if you come down first appointment, and I give you an appointment at 8:30-"
That would be good.
"- and then there's absolutely no waiting. The purpose of that visit will be to have a look at how you really feel about how you could move forward, and somehow fit in a more healthier lifestyle"
"I might have to look at my schedule, see whether anything-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"-can be arranged, or pass something on-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"-to something on to some--and-so it's not a wasted interview. So I can come here and say, ok, I looked at my schedule, looked at things-"
Good. Good. Good. Good
- whatever.
"Good. Good. Good. Good. Also, see if you can fix it up, and also give some thought to what we talked about."
"Yeah, of course."
Good stuff. Good stuff. okay. ok. ok.
"Okay, thanks. Sorry, went off a bit."
"Well, I'm glad we figured that out and I think you'll feel better over the next few days."
"Oh, thank you so much doctor. I just need a couple days off"
I would like to bring up another topic since I have you here and we still have a few minutes left. I've noticed that your blood pressure and your weight have been climbing over the years. We havent really had time to talk about this much before and may offer some useful strategies. Can we just talk about weight and health for a few minutes?
"Yeah, I suppose. I know my weight is a problem but every time I try to take it off I end up gaining it back. I'm not sure what to do."
I know how you feel. Managing weight can be frustrating. I think we can just start trying to figure this out together and I'll be here to help you through the challenges
Ok thank you doctor but I just want to know how I can possibly lose weight now since work is so busy and the kids take up so
"Yeah, that's certainly understandable. We both know that theres a lot that plays into weight management, but there is no need to figure it all out today, especially since. Maybe we could put our heads together and think about something small that fits reasonably into your life and then t"
"Oh, that sounds awesome. So, what should I do?"
"Well, let's see. Being active is one of the things that goes along with managing weight and health. Physical activity benefits the whole body. It's healthy for our joints, our stress levels, and especially for weight management. We could talk about some ways of adding activity that fits into your life."
I knew you were gonna say that but I dont have time in my schedule. Cant afford to take an hour to go to the gym every day
"Well, I understand that. I'm not an hour away from the gym either but one of the great things about physical activity is that any amount in. For example, let's think about some activities that you enjoy doing."
walking is my favorite thing
Me too. Me too. Walking is great exercise.
"Wait a minute, isnt walking too mild to help you lose weight, though?"
"Actually, even just a few minutes of walking is actually healthy and worthwhile, and then when you have time to. Walking is also great because you can do it anywhere, it doesnt need to be at the gym"
"Ooh wow, that sounds good. You know what? You know what. I have some time before I have to go back to work and see a nice park on the way over here, maybe"
That sounds awesome.
And you know what. Ive been using to really love to dance but I havent done that in so long
"Well, dancing is a great exercise, especially because it's fun."
Hmm. Interesting. And I know my family would support me if I could just find some place where I can go dancing
"Lol, so happy to hear that your family is so supportive. And I bet there's a dance class somewhere around where you live or maybe even a dance fitness class at the gym"
Yeah and you know what. I really like trying that
Would you mind doing some research on this and give it a go?
"Actually, I would. I kinda feel excited. What else did you get?"
"Small steps can go a long way. So, even things like taking the stairs instead of the elevator every once in a while or parking just a bit further from the door"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. I'm capable of that.
How about we start there and let's plan to follow up in a few weeks so we can see how it goes and then
Diet. The D word.
"Not necessarily. We definitely need to talk about some small steps that can fit into your life, and especially ones that make you feel good."
"Yeah, I like that. Okay, I'll make an appointment and start twerking right away, doc."
That's awesome. See you soon
". is the best. boy. So, um, tell me about the exercise."
"Well, um, I have been to the gym a few times since we spoke last."
You're in? You're in the
I'm still waiting for this. I
Thats fantastic.
Yeah and actually my pants feel a bit better too. I am so happy with this.
"So, what else have you noticed other than your-your-pants-fit-better-than-your"
"Um, I'm feeling better."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
My back critically
Your-- my what?
"Well, my back isnt hurting nearly as much as it used to"
Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow
"And, um, but it seems to be, um, but still hard. I guess that's why I-- I just need to be a little bit more patient with myself because its, um, I"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. So and what would you-- What would- What would help you get to building up to it. Spending more time there.
"Um, well, I guess just sticking with it and not getting, um, sidetracked."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"I-I havent been there since like last week until like Thursday during the week,-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
-so it was- frustrating week like for the gym that way.
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Ive been kinda busy with other stuff but, umphalic"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. But you made it-- You made it one day-
I-I'm getting differentiation
-instead of zero days.
"Yeah, and actually made it again on Saturday too. So. Much. Fucking."
Thats fantastic.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Even with this, pretty horrendous schedule going on, you know"
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's been a bit-ish hectic, y'all. I-I'm not a big fan of it too much because there are all these younger guys that can lift a lot more weight than me or they-. 'Cause I'm not buff and they are. And it-it's a bit discouraging to think how much work it takes to get, y'know, kinda back towards that"
So you- you guys wouldnt mind getting buffed?
"me realizing that im, yall, way past the age of where i would actually want to do that, when-. The gym and I see the buff young guys, you know, lifting a lot of weight and all that stuff, then you know, the--"
"So, but for right now, sounds like the-- just having the pants fit better-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"-sounds really, yall know that feeling of making yall feel good about yourself and confer"
This is. It is.
What other positive things have you noticed about your exercise routine?
"Well, I've noticed-- Well, I-Still need to work on my diet a lot. I havent-- I-I wouldnt mind saying that by working out at the gym, I have, uh, I -I modified my diet, but. Ive gotten a bit better with that but I would like to do a lot more"
In what way have you gotten a bit better?
"Um, a bit less junk food. Um, at times, when I feel like, ""Oh, I think I'll just go have a candy bar,"" or some worthless thing like that I'll actually have"
"So you are at the second thought part. And what do you think would--might take you, uh, over to actually doing this if you wanted to?"
"Uh, when I really start seeing some results at the gym, it kinda, uh, I think the way it works in my mind is if Ive worked out hard and"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"As I look at that double or triple fudge 4-decker of ice cream Sunday thing, you know, that somebody. Then-then that would probably--the--that would keep me from actually ordering one of those"
"Oh, okay. That's okay. The payoff just wouldn't be worth that 2 hours of treadmill vs that double fudgy browny thingy"
"Right, decadent-- Why do they put the word decadent in food?"
"'Cause it's decadent, it's lovely."
okay. ok. ok.
Yum yum yum yum yum yum
"okay. ok. ok. But it seems to be going so far so good. I-I guess, I can like, you know, um, I can like, uh, I can like, uh, I can like, uh, I can like, uh, I can. Um, I really-- I'm glad we talked that last time 'cause it- it- was the impetus to get me to go the first time in a long,"
"So, Liz, what is something that you want to change or maybe that you feel two different about right now?"
"Um, I really want to start working out again. Definitely want to get back into it, have a routine, and just be healthy."
"Okay, and-and why would you want to make this change?"
"Um, I hate feeling the way I do. I'm feeling sluggish. I think I want more energy especially with the winter coming"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Um, I'm not a big fan of how my clothes fit or don't fit me."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Just, not comfortable."
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, you said, your clothes fit you. So, you can't feel comfortable."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"What are some of the reasons why, um, this would be good for you to kinda make this change?"
"Um, I know exercise is--in the past, has always made me feel good. Ive been feeling good about myself, and just in general, exercise, I know, makes me feel good. My kids are so beautiful. I want to be a good example. I want them to feel this is a part of life-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"-exercising. So, here's the thing-- I really just want to get back in a routine."
"So, to heal--feel healthy for yourself as well be a good role model for your kids?"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"So, how would you go about getting exercise more into your daily routine?"
"Um, I'm not sure. Sitting in bed, maybe my husband and I will be able to do that, where he would be home with the kids and I"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Just to find the time to be able to do it, or what works in our schedule."
"So, its that balance of doing something for yourself but its sounds like you dont want that schedule to affect too much into your family"
"Right, yeah."
"So, on a scale from 1 to 10, 1 being not important and 10 being very important, where would you rate yourself on how"
"Mm, I'd like to say a seven or an 8, that's how important it is to me."
Okay and how come not at like 5 or 6
Because I really hate being overweight
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Not ha-- I just dont like being unhealthy. I dont feel good so I motivated to change, it just keeps coming, it just keeps coming"
"So, to recap, this is important for you to do.  sluggish feeling, and you know that you have other people in your family watching you, and you want to be a good role model for. Yet for you, struggling just a little with the logistics of when to schedule time for you so it doesnt interfere too much"
"Exactly, yeah."
"So, knowing this, what are you going to do next?"
"Probably, I don't know, find-- Still, while it's still somewhat okay outside, maybe pick days I'm going for walks or runs, um,"
That's awesome. Sounds like you have some options and leads on how to get that done.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Idk, I just have a lot of hard times trying to lose the rest of the weight. Um, right now, it feels like nothing but theres nothing else coming off like nothing else"
"Right, so you hit a plateau in your weight and despite all the things that you try to increase your activity, it doesnt seem to"
Nah and idk what Im doing wrong because I keep trying the exercise but nothing happens
"Right. Right. Right. So you feel like you spinning your wheels, doing more exercise and it shows no results on the scale?"
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes
And you don't feel so good about that?
"me coming home like, im going to the gym and then noticing nothing is happening and coming back to talk to my mama. Like no one wants to support in it anyway"
"Uh, so yall feel like yall doing this all alone?"
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes
At home or you think they will support you but they won't give- they won't give you what you need?
"Nah and specifically my dad, he just-- Not only does he not want to support me with it but at the same time, he feels like I need to"
"Oh, okay. That's okay."
So Iphalous
Tell me about that.
"I'm losing weight, it feels like I'm somehow disconnecting myself from my family, and he thinks that I'm trying to form myself to fit in like this"
Hi Natalie. Lovely to meet you. I'm Dawn. I'm Dawn.
Hi Dawn. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you. Thanks for coming out today
Thanks for having me
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. tell me a little something about yourself
"So Im, um, 28. And about 6 months ago I moved out to Arizona. Um, I really enjoy spending time with my family and hanging out with friends whenever I can. Work keeps me pretty busy. Um, But I really, um, look to sort out some changes to my diet and physical activity. I don't like where my weight is at right now, and, uh, so I thought it'd be good to come and talk with you about some of that"
"Yea, you feel a bit unsatisfied with your health patterns?"
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I really started noticing how I feel sluggish and just not-- My mood shifts a lot too, which at first, I thought"
"Okay, so you feel some low energy and you know, in the past, when you have been more active and ate different, you have"
Right. Right. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Especially during times when I get more active is when I notice the biggest cha-change in energy and mood.
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Say more about that, those earlier times that you were active."
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Ive been playing sports in college, so that kept me pretty busy, and that was really fun, um, and just think back now to, as much that I would cram into a 24 -hour period,. Um, so when I think back to like, probably like peak of my life of when I felt my best physically, mentally"
"Youve had energy, and you were like the Energizer Bunny, just keep going and going and going."
"Yeah, exactly. And it's not the same anymore. Um like when I get home from work, I'm pretty exhausted, uh, it takes a lot for me to want to be physically active when I. And so, um, yeah, that's probably been my biggest, uh, issue is like when work ends, going home and. Um, just trying to like unwind by watching Netflix or something else, right?"
"So your days are just as full now that you work and a career person, um, and your energy level isnt what it used to be. What-- Any ideas on why that might have been shifting?"
"I mean, when I was in college, it wasnt really an option to go, like, I had to do those things because th. I-I do feel like a-an urgency to go it just doesnt seem like the step that's missing is for me to actually go to a gym or somet. Like, I think I want it to just the doing it that seems to not happen."
"Right. Right. Right. So in the past, it wasnt up to you whether you had the choice to go be physically active or not. It is up to you, and-and you look back at the past few years and say, I wanna do things different."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
I wanna be more physically active than I already am
"Yeah, yeah, I think so. say like, I wanna run a marathon but I do think that having a better outlook on life, um, and better energy to- if I"
Awesome. Great. And you noticed an exercise-induced mood enhancement.
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
tell me more about that. What are you specifically noticing about your mood on days you are physically active?
"Just, I- I'm- I'm happier and more upbeat and I think that even my outlook is more. Ive been sitting in traffic, and I havent been physically active, probably grumbled about it but if I sat in. So just kinda helps with that ripple effect into my day of like getting more stuff done."
"Yea, feeling more accomplished and- feeling less irritated by small stuff."
"Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. Exactly, exactly."
"Awesome. Great. Well, let me see if I got this all. You've come to Arizona 6 months ago, tryna figure out new rhythms and patterns for yourself. You were real active because you were an athlete, and now its more up to you about making that choice of physical"
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um, I mentioned, I don't totally like my weight, um, and so hoping that would have some impact there and-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Tell me more about your weight concerns. When did you start feeling unhappy with your body?
"Uh, probably about 3, 4 months ago. My clothes started fitting tighter, which wasnt as comfortable, and, um, yeah, just not super happy with my appearance,. Ive generally been pretty okay with that, and then in the last 3 months, I just feel, um, like Ive had a lot more negative outlook"
"Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. Ok, so sounds like a vicious cycle and- maybe the lacking physical activity has made you feel less confident in yourself. I wonder if this also a piece of this puzzle since you mentioned that's been a huge difference from what was"
"Yeah, I think- I think the activity piece and then also to like, the foods that I eat, I don't think. So that also kinda does the same thing, I think, to my appearance or the way that I viewed myself."
"okay. ok. ok. Pretty self confidence, pretty body image all the way up until a few months ago and, um, yall are hoping to sort"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Awesome. Great.
"Well see, my wife has been getting on me a lot lately about trying to get my health habits up, and I really don't see. I mean, Ive been working real hard. Home for dinner at Applebees or something like that, so I really dont see what the big deal is"
"Okay and so what I hear is that you dont feel your health is bothering you right now, or anything like that?"
I-I-I'm feeling fine.
okay. ok. ok.
I usually work out in the hot sun the majority of the day so I'm usually sweating out any like bad things I put in my system
"okay. ok. ok. Have you noticed putting on any weight, or anything like--?"
"Well, a bit, but nothing too--you know. I am not blo- I am not bloated or anything"
okay. ok. ok. okay. ok. ok. And how about going see the doctor. Have you been to--for a visit or anything recently?
"Yeah, I was in the doctor about maybe last year for a physical but-- I mean, everything showed up to be"
okay. ok. ok. But do you feel that you feel good?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"okay. ok. ok. Um, and so what I hear is that you-- you feel that your wife might be, uh, overreacting to this?"
"Well, not really overreacting. I know she-she-she-wants me, uh, you know, live a long time and be healthy, but just sometimes, like kinda going out to eat at these places"
"Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure. okay. ok. ok. Um, and so one thing I just want to do is maybe give you some information on, um, maybe obesity or diabetes if you. If you are, you know--?"
Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure. [unintelligible 00:01:33]
okay. ok. ok. Good. Good. Good. Good
"So, again, I hear your overall goal is to not give up these things you would love but to cut back on how"
"Yeah, I guess so."
"-on that. Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. I would have liked to have asked you, uh, kinda a scaling question about this 'cause I hear that this feels really"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"I'll ask the question this way, on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is not at all confident, and 10 is like, ""I am very, very"
Probably- right now
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
-gonna say a 6.
A six. A six. A six
But I know when I go home and see the food its probably gonna drop down to a 4
"okay. ok. ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. So, lets talk about that, um, so we should just assume we're going to be at a 4."
Right? Right? Right?
Okay? Okay. Okay. Okay
I guess.
"So, why are you at a 4 and not even a lower number. Why is it like you dont have a zero or a one?"
"Because Ive been wanting to do this for years, like-"
okay. ok. ok.
-ever since i became conscious of my body.
okay. ok. ok.
"Like ever since Ive been a teen, like this has always been a goal of mine, like, especially 'cause all my hom"
Uh-huh. Uhhhh.
"-hike, and are like super stick-thin but really healthy and active."
okay. ok. ok.
"And so it is. I just sort of like, well, I don't."
okay. ok. ok.
But I wanna be like-- I dont wanna be like stick-thin but I really wanna be like really healthy and really active
okay. ok. ok.
"And like be able to look pretty, yall"
Ok. All the best.
i wanna be pretty
"okay. ok. ok. So, what would help increase that confidence. What-- Because that sounds like where we really need to focus on. What do you think helps you feel more confident about this?"
I'm not even really sure-
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"-honestly. Like, I mean, I know I need to keep like telling myself like-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
-like this is something that you want- that youve wanted-
Uh-huh. Uhhhh.
-for years.
Uh-huh. Uhhhh.
"Like, you can do this. Because like-"
okay. ok. ok.
I know I can do this. Like I can do anything
Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok.
I'm capable of doing anything-
Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok.
-I know that. But its hard getting to the point where I-
okay. ok. ok.
-do something.
"Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok, time to put the- let's put the changing the eating pattern off to the side, and look at some other time in your life. And what was it about-. What kind of strengths did you bring to the table that allowed you to tackle something that felt like a challenge and-"
"Hi Liz. Thanks for the follow. Well, it was a good day. Thanks for meeting me today."
Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure
"So what is something that you want to change or, um, work towards?"
"Well, [sighs] Ive been thinking about working out lately. Really want to start working out again. It-it was in my mind, I know I need to do it. It just keeps getting the motivation to do it"
And you been talking about that lately. So I really-
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"-feel like this is something that you need to do ASAP because, um, a lot of times, you just a. And then, there is no action. And if you really want results, I think that's something that needs to be done. And, stop being lazy about it and just do it."
"Well, idk if I'm being lazy enough to not be on the phone. I'm thinking it's just that I have a busy schedule"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Im just need to find the time to do it. Also, I might be lacking a bit of motivation, but I think it's more timing and trying to fit it in."
"And that sounds like a lot of excuses to me. So I feel like youve shared with me before that you do have a gym membership. So I think thats something that you just need to fit in your schedule. So for you to really see results that you want, my guess is you need to go about 3 to 4 times a week and really fit in that hour workout"
"I think that part of the problem is that I-I dont have 3 to 4 times-3 to 4 times a week to do it, or an hour. I mean, hour is long because if I work out for an hour that means I leave home to get"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"-time there, time back. I mean, its not just an hour, its like 2 hours, realistically."
"And it seems like if you really want the results you have to put the time in. And if it takes you 2 hours to get ahold of yourself then it takes you 2 hours to get ahold of. And, again, if you want the results that you want, you need to start, and you need to start now."
"Well, uh, okay."
"Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. Well, um, I look forward to talking to you tomorrow. And I hope that you can say that you went to the gym"
okay. ok. ok.
Thanks. For the follow!
"Hi Mrs. Smith. I'm Denise. I'm Denise. I'm the social worker here at the clinic work that works with Dr. Fields and the rest of the team. I was just trying to let you know, I usually work with people who are similar to- have situations similar to you,. And, uh, so I'd like to find out a bit if you'd, if that's okay, about how it's been since you got"
Pretty good. Well done.
Yeah? Oh yeah?
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um, glad to be there."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What are you really glad about?
"Uh, well, I'm glad to see my dog, he's very cute, and it just feels good to be home"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And my garden is coming along, and my neighbors have stuff-- It's-it's-so-good. Its good to be home"
"I know, I-I understand that was really-- That was your goal,. able to get home and it sounds like youve been able to really en- enjoy parts of it, and I know youve been going to the-"
"Well, um. Thats a no. I-I didnt get- go-to- physical therapy this week, and the- or Tai Chi, actually."
"So, I wonder if something happened that led you not to go. You're looking down a bit, um,"
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, um. Thats a no. I was a little semi down but I didnt fall down completely but I-I did--I guess I still had the wobblies and I-I was hoping that the physical therapy and the Tai Chi. So, I think I was pushing too hard, that maybe I should cut back, you know, and kinda not try so hard to-"
Mm. the mf. So youve been working hard-
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-you've worked really hard to get home through this whole thing.
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes
And you- continued to work really hard with both physical therapy and Tai Chi and taking care of your house and
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"And youve had this fall or semi-fall, and you feel like maybe- maybe you were pushing too hard?"
"Yeah, yeah."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"So I-I cut back, and I-I don't know if I should really even continue Tai Chi because it's-it's very"
"Yeah, yeah. That's a lot of work."
"Uh, it's beautiful and-but, um, yeah."
What are you concerned about?
That I'll- that I'll fall again.
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"I'll really fall and hurt myself, and this way, if I don't move around so much, there's less chance that I'll"
"Yeah, yeah, yeah. And- so you dont want to hurt yourself."
No. No no no no no
And what are your concerns-- It's not as if you- feel that you hurt yourself in this fall.
"Nah, I didn't- it was just more terrifying, and it felt like a-a signal that maybe I do too much"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And, what are you concerned will happen if-if you get hurt or something-"
"I could- anything, you know, really get hurt, and then-then-then I wouldn't be able to be home anymore, and that. Im trying to stay home. So I wanna do what I gotta do to-to-stay home."
And it feels like the only way that you can really stay safe and not fall is to not do anything to hunker down.
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [Laughs] Yes, you put it well, hunker down-"
"Yeah, yeah."
"Watch tv and pet my dog. I-I, you know, not to that extreme, but yeah, I think- I think maybe, um, yeah, I was-going- pushing too hard"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"And I dont know about Tai Chi anymore. I-I think physical therapy, I can understand that, but I'm not so sure about Tai Chi."
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So physical therapy can- you can kinda still see that it helps to build your strength, which-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-might have helped you break your fall this time
Right. Right. Right. Right.
"Um, I wonder what you remember about what-what Dr. Fields said about Tai Chi in relationship to falls. Did she talk about that?"
"She did. She did. Sh-- Yeah, that's right, that's right. I thought she said that they've done studies and that they found that it's really preventative. I think she- I forget the- the percentage, but yeah, she was really enthusiastic and does it herself."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So you feel betrayed like it didn't-- ""Look, and I did this, I was doing my Tai Chi, and all of a sudden, I- here, look at this."""
"That's a strong word, isn't it, ""betrayed"". Um, wow. Wow. A little but-but-I-I know, I know that's true. I mean, my friend who does Tai Chi, she just- she loves it. Maybe its just not for me, yall know"
Right. Right. Right.
"But, um-"
"Bit about whether or not this might be what's useful and, you know, it-does really come down to what's. And I would love to work with you as I know Dr. Fields would, to-help build a plan that helps you feel as safe in your home-"
Right. Right. Right.
-and to keep you there and to keep you feeling safe.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Wh-what are you thinking about?
"Absolutely, because I'm not- now I'm- I'm feeling-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-really a little scared that what if- what if- what if- what if- I fall down and-. I may have heard about that.
"Yeah, right. Right. Right."
"So, um, 'cause I'm lonely."
"Yeah, yeah."
Sophalous
So it really kinda strikes you that you- that you are- that you are alone and this could happen and--
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"What thoughts are you having. What have you heard that others have done, or what are- what are- what are- thoughts do you have?"
"Well,-- I think some things could be done to-- I know people who live in-in residence, have a cord they can pull, but how. Um, is there anything else I could do just to communicate if-if-"
"Yeah, yeah."
-if something happens?
"Yeah, yeah. Ive been working with a lot of the folks that Ive worked with is there like- its called a lifeline and they can wear it around their neck and"
I'm starting to think I've seen something like this on TV.
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
Is this- does this actually work?
This works really well.
"'Cause you know that they sell so much stuff on TV, it's like you could- [crosstalk]"
Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right.
This is fucking insane
"A few different products out there but it-it really helps, uh, and-it kind of gives-might"
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. guess so, feeling a little bit scared-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
-you know about that happening and-
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"So, yeah, it's probably a signal to- make some-some-changes."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Like I'm not going back to the hospital, right. I'm really not. Do I need to? No."
We- we need to work with you to help you stay home as long as you can and be safe.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"So what do you think that will take, um, because you are the one that really knows how you feel about in the house and how. What do you think. The lifeline is an option, that's something you can consider."
That I'll definitely- I'm definitely gonna do that
Mm. the mf.
Definitely want to do that
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. What else do you think it would take for you to feel safe?
"I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I. I felt a bit, you know, I was moving along and things were feeling more positive, it sorta"
"Yeah, yeah."
-one step back but now it takes two steps forward and three steps back. [Laughs]
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"So, um, is there, yeah, like a support somehow. My daughter is very good and calls me but you know, she-she lives in Seattle, she-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-far away.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
So- and dont want to impose on my neighbors or my friends.
So you guys would like some more support-
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
-and a bit more connection maybe that-
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"-that-that, um, that has to happen. Would you mind some suggestions?"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"We also have here, we-we-can-get-some-case-management-services-and-that-might-be-someone-who-comes-in-and-checks-with-you-at-home"
Right. Right. Right.
"-and, uh, and- also might help you organize and connect up with other services that might be out there or doin. I'm not sure. How does that sound to you?"
"Yeah, that would be good. Should I try Tai Chi again?"
"Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. I was going to say the other thing that I would say- that I would consider because the senior centre, and I know you"
Yes. Great place.
-and I wonder if you feel there is support there. activities going on at senior center that- and I- and I- don't know what was in Tai Chi included that might-
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. guess i kinda went to extreme. I'm a tend to do that. [chuckles] yeah. So, keep moving?"
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This sounds so mad dont it. Like the- it- when it feels like inside, what you- what I hear from you is that it feels like moving is unsafe"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"We know that making perfect safety impossible, but we also know that the more you move and the more active that you stay, the less"
Seriously? Really? Seriously?
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes
"Oh, okay. That's okay."
Can't prevent all of this-
Uh-huh. Uhhhh.
-but we can make it less likely.
okay. ok. ok. okay. ok. ok. okay. ok. ok. I-I'm willing to start again so to speak.
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This is terrifying.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Takes a lot. Takes a lot. And you are the only one that can- that can know what it is you are willing to work through that fear.
"Well, I'm willing to work through my fears and difficulties to be in my little house with my little dog and my little garden. Ive been there for- since my husband and I got married, and thats where we lived, and I dont want to give up yet"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. And that's a strong enough motivator for you and gives you enough purpose that you can like kind of push through that
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-concern about being safe.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I-
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-I-I'm. I'm. I'm. And I feel like I have some help
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, we can definitely talk abt it when you come in again like-"
okay. ok. ok.
"-again, and-"
"So, am I being a baby?"
Not at all.
okay. ok. ok.
Not being a baby. This is pretty normal- this is-
Seriously? Really? Seriously?
"-very normal. Absolutely. Absolutely. Feelings of a stroke and the trying to get back to it and find a way to get back to it, the stroke and the"
Seriously? Really? Seriously?
"Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. And actually, you- you've really demonstrated to me anyway, a lot of strength and courage because you continue to persevere and. And you found a way to get home and seem really committed to staying home. So you- you have so much strength there that you are working with"
Thank you. You are welcome. Thank you. You are welcome.
"And we can work together to make sure that--and- Dr. Fields too, I know, is very interested in that. We can work together to make sure that we can keep you there. #WeTheNorth"
"Well, and she- she- she- she- she- she- she- she- she- she"
Not yet. Not yet.
Not yet? Not yet? Not yet. [Laughs] Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I- I- I was sort of- hes been hes been hes been hes been hes been hes been
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
-about-
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"-this, but, um, uh, I sorta want to thank you for this. I'm so glad I did."
I love you for doing this too. I really appreciate it because that's the only way that we can work together-
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
- to help you feel safer. And I hope you feel safe going home today feeling safer
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So the-the caseworker is gonna be able to come and refresh-
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
-me? literally me?
We can get you hooked
"And-and this is-- Oh, yeah."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"I mean, to know that I have communication that I w- that was my biggest fear that something-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
- would happen and I wouldnt have-
Mm. the mf.
-any way to tell anybody.
"Good. Good. Good. Good. Well, you got some good plans and we'll go check it out and make sure it happens."
okay. ok. ok.
Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. Thanks. For the follow!
Good morning Scott.
Hi. Nice to meet you.
"Um, we were talking a bit earlier, and you said you wanted to exercise."
Im doing. Thats it. That
What is this all about?
"Well, just can't seem to get back in the gym. I'm not gonna-- I-I've been working out quite a bit, and in the past, I dunno, few years I just--. Got busy, and now I'm out of the habit, and I-I really, I dunno, feel like I need to get back."
"I think you just need to maybe sit back and write down a list of reasons why you need to get back to the gym, and then on the other side of the list"
okay. ok. ok. Um. Is. That. Okay. Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. Umphaloid
What gym are you in?
"Uh, I'm a member of the- The Sports Fitness Center."
okay. ok. ok. And-and how far away is your home?
Just a couple of miles.
"Just a couple of miles. Mm. the mf. So you-- you could, like, ride your bike or walk there, and it would be [unintelligible 00:01:12] too."
"I probably wouldn't even need to go to the gym if I walked that far, right?"
"Well, I'm not sure about that. Um. Is. That. Okay. I mean, getting your, um, not just your, cardiovascular, but also, your, uh, weightlifting, the [inaudible 00:"
[inaudible 00:01:33] training.
"Yeah, yeah."
It-it-it would be important.
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So why-why-do you wanna-- what do you wanna do with that. You're looking different, or--?"
"Well, I-I-I would feel better. My-- I would- I would- I would- wear more my clothes. Ive been growing around the middle and I wouldnt mind, uh, going back to where I was, you know, get into a 34, 36 waist"
okay. ok. ok.
I-I feel more comfortable--. I'm thinking that's the main thing.
"okay. ok. ok. Yeah, because your-your health really, to me, is more important than your-your looks. I mean, dont get me wrong, I understand what youre saying but, yall know, it would be great to get back in those jeans"
"Yeah, yeah. It-it-it-it-- I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I"
"Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. Well, I think you know what to do. Youve done this before."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Just a matter-- You just gotta do it
I gotta make time.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
I gotta make time.
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And so that might mean, like giving up an hour's sleep, getting up an hour earlier in the day, and going there. Thats what I do."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. okay. ok. ok.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok.
"I mean, that's what I'd like you to do is, uh, experiment with getting up an hour earlier and, uh,. I mean, I know sleep is important, but-- And then bring that list back that we talked ab"
okay. ok. ok.
Okay? Okay. Okay. Okay
okay. ok. ok.
"Okay, so next week."
okay. ok. ok. Very good. Well done. Thanks. For the follow!
Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye
Thanks for coming in. Tell me what happened since we last spoke.
"Well, um, I, um, got an interview for a job. Umphaloid"
Wow. Thats so awesome.
"Yeah but I wasnt able to go, um, cause my kids, I didnt have one to watch. And, um, so the- that sort of game over. Just, I've just, had to cancel the interview and this, it's too bad because it was a really, a- actually"
You sound disappointed.
"Yeah, because it's- it's, you know, I didn't really have a choice. guess i have to be- i need to make sure my kids are taken care of first. And, um, yall, I'm worried that this will keep happening."
You gotta turn down opportunities that shit keeps happening
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Mm-hmm okay. Well, tell me, um, on a scale from 1 to 10, how important is getting a job?"
"Um, sitting about 10 because yeah, I mean, I'm the only one supporting my kids and, um, you know, it's just, what I get. So really need to get a job and get it soon"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You- you- you- you- you- you- you- you
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Please provide for your children.
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Um, and tell me on a scale from 1 to 10 how confident are you that you could get a job?"
"I mean, I think I'm about at a 3 right now. I mean, even if I get into the interview and get childcare, you know, when I show up, I have this resume that it. So I just feel like I'm not, um, I don't know, that employable."
"So, it sounds like, the childcare issue has been getting in the way, and so finding something that would work for"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Also, it sounds like you kinda feel not so great about your resume and your experience."
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Limited and even when I was out of the workforce and even when I was at work, I mean, it's not, I don't feel that can lead to the"
okay. ok. ok. What is it that makes you- what is it that makes you want?
"I can be home every night and spend time with my kids even if my kids are in childcare during the day, that"
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, if you had- if you had consistent work, it would change your life in a lot of ways."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That would be huge.
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. This would provide the income that you need and you wouldn't be so worried about it.
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Also, it would be nice to just know what Im doing and just have my routine."
Right. Right. Right. So every day you know where you're going.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
okay. ok. ok. And you know what- what is- what is- what is- what is- what is- what is-
"Right. Right. Right. Well, that would be good, if I knew, that my kids are taken care of too-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
- so I can stop worrying about them while I'm at work.
Right. Right. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Because you- you the kind of parent that wants to make sure your kids are doing well.
Right. Right. Right.
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um, so tell me, what would it take to get you to like a five in confidence, to feel a bit more confident about getting work?"
"Well, being able to make the interviews would be a priority, I mean."
"Okay, Yeah. Thats it. That"
"Um, so chi- you know, taking care, having some childcare, having-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
- having someone I can trust that I can call when I know Ive got an interview.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Because you definitely need to go to an interview in order to get the job.
Right. Right. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
I think having taken care of that part would definitely help.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
What else would get you to a 5?
"Um, just wish that I had- I need more experience or, um, more education. I feel like everyone has college education and I dont have that on my resume"
okay. ok. ok.
I'm getting asked about education and training and competitiveness
Mm-hmm mm-hmm.
"- um, yall, I just, as soon as I was asked about it, I just feel like I'm not good enough-"
okay. ok. ok.
- since I'm not that one.
"Yeah, so if you had something on your resume that was around education training, maybe a certificate of some kind of"
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, something I could talk about in the interview too. I could, you know, with confidence talk about- about that, even if I was some type of certification where"
"Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. okay. ok. ok. What--do you have any ideas as to what fields you might want to get some more education, more training?"
"I mean, I guess I just dont know what it is because I need a job now so I really dont"
Like what is fastest.
"Right. Right. Right. I almost feel like this is more important than what I care about, you know, because I'm like, I don't go back to school for 4 years"
"Okay and so if- you were, it sounds like if you were going to do something you'd do something real quick like a short- a"
"Something that I could get immediate skills that would, you know, get me into some kind of a job now, even if it"
"Yeah, sort of like short term or transition into something else."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Awesome. Great. Exactly. Exactly.
But that would be steady and pay well?
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
Ok and allow you to afford everything you need to afford.
"Yeah, because even those jobs right now don't feel accessible to me. They seem like, you know--seems like if--maybe if I was better on computer or you know"
"Okay, so specifically getting some computer skills will help?"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm thinking so- I think so because I'm not-- I can't-- I really have nothing on my resume that talks about attractiveness
The technology.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. okay. ok. ok. It sounds like getting a job is really important right now and you really need the money and you really need the
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Um, as well as maybe doing some sort of certificate or getting some classes and training in computers?"
"Yeah, that would be cool."
okay. ok. ok.
That would be awesome.
"So what would you like to do next, you think?"
"Well, find the childcare resources-"
okay. ok. ok. ok.
- is- seems to be- that seems to be the cardiovascular factor
Thats a priority.
The priority 'cause I cant even do an interview without that
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"And then, um, I mean-- I guess getting into some type of- some type of training program that, y"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"- like maybe there's a weekend, I mean Helsinki, I mean Helsinki,"
Hi Hannah. Love you. Nice to meet you.
Hi. Nice to meet you.
So I understand that you were referred to me by your GP because you have some anxiety difficulties.
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um, yeah, I suppose it kinda- it kinda started like 5, 6 years ago, so"
okay. ok. ok.
"Um, this kinda escalated a bit. Um, I just recently moved out, um, from living with my parents. So just made it a bit worse, I think"
okay. ok. ok. Is this the first time that you left home?
"Yeah, I'm- Yeah. First time actually, yeah. Um, I've been going to a few years ago. Just thought it would be easier to stay at home, so."
okay. ok. ok. So it's been quite a step and a change and it sounds like that was what led you to go to your GP.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"So how has that, uh, changed things for you?"
"Um, don't know, it kinda kinda kinda kinda kinda kinda kinda kinda kinda kinda kinda kinda kinda kinda kinda kinda kinda kinda kinda kinda kinda kinda. I'm feeling, hopefully this is, this is it like, it- it'll help, but I don't know. I'm not like I used to think I had to do this. never thought I'd ever want to be the type of person you have to actually go and like get help"
okay. ok. ok. So how are you feeling today?
This is how scared I look. I'm not sure. Hopefully this will help.
"okay. ok. ok. So you would, feeling a bit anxious today"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"okay. ok. ok. So I guess just going back to why you went to the GP and how you ended up kind of coming here today. So it sounds like you have been experiencing anxiety for quite some years now. Um, but just recently you moved out of home for the first time and, um, and that was what type of led you to the GP. So how did that change things. How was things after you moved out?"
"Um, I thought that they'd be better, but 'cause I thought I'd have to kinda be independent and guess actually a lot worse. So I-I just kinda stay in the house a lot. Im really not friends or anything. I mean my family come and visit a bit but it's not-- I don't know. kinda creepy because i just sorta--that should just end the flight by myself, which i always thought i would like, but"
okay. ok. ok. So what other types of difficulties that you have been experiencing?
"Um, I mean, I'm- I'm a photographer. -- it stopped me a bit, my anxiety, from being able to get work and because every time, you know, an. So that was kinda making things hard in that respect and um, just kind of friends wise and all. Im just feeling myself lately. I just feel like I'm just getting more alone. So this kinda stopped me from making friends and, yall know, like relationships and stuff."
"okay. ok. ok. So, um, your difficulties get in your way, and you do certain things that make you. So they are, they stop you from taking up certain types of work and as a freelance photographer, I guess that-. And they also stop you or make you feel like it stunts you, uh, socially. You arent kind of able to make new friends and get to meet new people."
"Yeah, yeah. easier when I was at home because I was obviously, I mean, my parents, so it would, but you know,. I mean-- Ive been going like 2 weeks for coffee with my friends and the whole time I just kinda want to go home. So I'm not, I just don't want that to happen. Im not ready to lose everyone. So-"
"So you kinda feel that way. How, where this leads to."
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um, yeah."
So you said that you first noticed the anxiety kicking in about 5 or 6 years ago.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
So you'd be about 19.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
And what was happening around that time?
"Uh, I guess I finished school about a year before that. I-I always felt shy, um, at school but it never really affected the things as much as it has. I just feel like I was expected to be kind of moving out or doing something and then it just escalated from there. I- I really like doing photography but I just kind of get less and less work as it goes on, so, which is my thing,"
What kind of work is the most difficult for you in your job?
"I guess when it- I gotta kinda be working on other people. Um, I'm not a fan of that. I'm trying to sort out if I'm being a bit of a hypocrite, trying to sort out if I'm like taking places with p. So I'm just not doing this."
"So, tell me a bit more about what happens then. So, focus on maybe an invitation to do a job with, uh, you know, it involves, uh, photography with-. What kind of thoughts go through your head?"
"I get really hot and sweaty, and I dont-- I feel like everyone is looking at me and thinking that I'm just like really stupid,. And I'm just an asshole. And theyll think that I just look like a weirdo and just try and-- I mean, I just kinda try and--. So why I like doing shots where its just me and the camera 'cause I- then I can just put all my attention on that instead of having"
"okay. ok. ok. So much going through your head then at the point where you get that invitation and you think, ""People will look, people will stare,. So much about what you- what you think other the people will think. And how does that make you feel?"
"Um, just makes me feel like an asshole, makes me feel like I shouldnt even bother trying anymore. I should just go home and just-- I think I just dont want to be in that situation anymore. I'm just feeling like everyone else is doing fine and they're normal and I'm just the freak, you can't, like do normal"
okay. ok. ok. Can you give me an example of a-a recent situation. Maybe we can focus on that.
"Um, like a work situation or just--?"
"Yeah, time when you were maybe doing a job with some people and you felt the social anxiety, you know, that kick in"
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I've been doing a job where it kinda looks like a- a- Nature issues and I have to work with a lot of different people. Um, and, um, when they told me about the job, I thought it would be fine. I thought it was just going to be a few other photographers but there was actually people and, you know, I was taking photos of p. And I guess- they asked me to, umphal"
This is quite interesting. Was that a fashion shoot or something?
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This was a fashion thing. I'm thinking this was for some kind of-- I don't know if this was a campaign or something, but,"
okay. ok. ok.
"Yeah, it was, yeah, it was really cool, but I find it- found it- was really hard to try and focus on that 'cause"
So this wasnt what you expected?
No. No no no no no. No. No no no no no
So how long ago was this?
2 weeks ago. That was a real one.
okay. ok. ok. So quite recent.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"So on that particular day, what was the thoughts that went through your head when you were in that situation?"
"just felt really- just really kind of hot. Couldn't really breathe and just felt like I really wanted to just get out. Trying really hard to just focus on you and just, you know, hold the camera and just, you know, no mind,"
I can tell you getting kinda anxious even just thinking about that day
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"okay. ok. ok. So you're describing quite a lot there to me. So you, you kinda got hot and sweaty, you said that you- you held the camera, you-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"W-what was, do you mean try to hide behind it or?"
"I was just trying to focus. I was just thinking if I could just hold it real tightly, it would just-- I don't know. I kinda just wanted to be able to just get through it and just focus"
So you guys hold your camera tightly
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
W-why was that. Why was that helpful?
"Cause I felt like I was getting real like hot and flushed and I just thought, at least if I can just--. I was just trying to keep my hands still on it, sounds weird. sweaty and like shaking like loads, like, and I could just tell everyone was looking and they could see,"
"okay. ok. ok. So, okay. So this sounds like you had a lot of thoughts going through your head. Um, you said that you were worried that everyone is watching you. What other thoughts were in your mind that went around your head?"
"Just stupid and it just felt like kinda- like everyone just staring and just, I just felt like I-- Like-. And then just thinking about what was she doing?"
They could tell what constitutes
just felt like sweaty and justphalic
"Lol, it was all-all that they could see that-that was-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
okay. ok. ok.
"Um, I was trying to wear black so this kind of tries to cover it up and just like a lot of layers, so they can't tell but,. Ive been red and just-- Just wishing that I wasnt there anymore."
"So, I mean, you already described it to me a bit, but if you think about how you looked that day, how'd"
"I'm thinking just very stupid and, like, I think my face really red. I could feel it flushing and I knew that I- I probably sweat and shook, like my hands rlly r. Um, and af-- it was, like, definitely noticeable. Everyone could definitely see."
Okay and what-what did you do about--how did you try and conceal that or hide that?
"Just looked down, just trying not to do anything weird or-- 'Cause, I mean, they could probably tell I was being weird anyway,"
So youve avoided looking at people. I thought you wore black as well in kind of preparation anyway. It sounds like you
I always do this even if its really hot or I wear just loads of layers and just 'cause otherwise I-
Okay and how did this end?
"went on for like an hour or so, and then, um, people went out for drinks after just to kind of celebrate like that we. I wouldve just- just got home straight away, just got on my car and went home. After they would have seen me being weird and I just wanted to get-home straight away I just didnt want to be around them"
okay. ok. ok.
"Something clicked, I had a bunch to drink and, uh, and I knew I messed up. Totally messed up."
How did you know you messed up?
"Because I was- because I was right there, man. I was right there when I'd come home and would pop a few of those pills, it was the same deal, like and. I've been wanting to stay exactly like this. And just felt like I ruined everything. I know, Erin is using the phone now and he called me the next day and it was, uh, great, but I kinda feel ashamed of myself"
"Um, where you put something that was genuinely important to you at risk? Was that something that happened. Is this what that was about, um, when you say you felt guilty, uh, talking to Erin on the phone?"
"Because of what-- Yeah, I guess, I think that's what I mean, yeah, yeah, yeah. Because you know, I mean- I could have stayed, I could have gotten, I could have done this every night for the rest of the week"
So youve seen yourself putting something that was important to you at risk.
"But I dont know if Ive stopped because I knew I had to stop or because, you know, it was like right there,. Anyway, just, uh, [crosstalk]."
"Here you are actually, 3 months on, 3 long months as you say, um, and things are going quite well, Uh, you"
"They look better, yeah."
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I dont know if it felt like a green light or a yellow, it went from red to cautionary, you could see your kids"
"Yeah, yeah."
"Well, I wanna thank you for coming out to see me today. Um, I do understand from talking to your counselor that you have quite a lot on your plate, you have a lot going on. Can you say a bit more about that?"
"I also started going back to night class, and then recently, I also start going back to full time as a server at a restaurant. I-I just been feeling so stressed lately"
"Yeah, I could see that. Um, may I also ask, are you also a single mom?"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"So you have a lot of stressors right now. Youre a single mom raising a 2 year old, working full time, and going back to school. What would you guys think would be the most helpful for us to focus on today? #MGMAV"
"Well, I-I've been told that childcare is probably my-my biggest issue right now."
okay. ok. ok. Can you say a bit more about that?
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um, well, my mom normally watches my son but lately it's kinda becoming an issue. I know she like will back out at the last second, and so I had to call in at work a few times. Ive had to miss class a few times. So i-it's just stressful, you know, whether i'll be able to do those things or not"
"okay. ok. ok. So I hear you say that the situation with your mom's not ideal. You're actually missing class sometimes and had to lose some work shifts as well, and that's problematic"
"Exactly, exactly."
"okay. ok. ok. Um, outside your mum, is there anyone else that can help with childcare?"
"A sister but I dont trust her to watch my son, and I dont really know that many people that-- the only. She-she actually has, uh, a 3 year old daughter, so you know, kinda worked out."
okay. ok. ok.
"Um, I'm not that well versed in her that well, but I mean, she seems pretty and I-I think she did a pretty"
Hmm. Interesting. So what I hear is this neighbor was supportive when you really needed her to be
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Stepped in last minute. Um, when you picked up your son, did you have any concerns and he seemed happy?"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"okay. ok. ok. Lets pursue that neighbor a bit. Um, people like this, I like to think of as natural resources, but I know for a lot of p"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Have you given any thought to, if you will be able to afford to pay someone on a regular basis to watch your son?"
"-- you know, I mean, maybe a bit, but I don't really make that much money to be able to afford something like daycare or,"
"Yeah, I can understand that. Um, what are some of your natural skills?"
"Well, I mean, I like cooking. I-I actually have culinary arts in school"
"Lol, bet you're a really good cook then. Um, what would you think about a plan where you work out an arrangement with this neighbor, where in exchange for her watching your son"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Um, you could maybe swap a meal for child care. What do you think of a concept like this?"
"Hmm. Interesting. Thats, interesting. I-I never really thought of something like this, but, yeah, it might work."
"okay. ok. ok. Oh, okay, I'm glad you think so. Um, so, other than this neighbor, or is there anyone else that could help you?"
"Hmm. Interesting. Nah, I-- you know, there just aren't that many people I trust right now with my son."
"okay i can respect that. Yall really gotta go with kinda gut and follow your own intuition on that one. Um, what about the baby daddy, is he of any help?"
"[chuckles] nah not at all. He, he really hasn't been in the picture since my son was born."
"Ok fine, fine. You know what? You know what. We got one really good lead with the neighbor. I think if you would follow up in pursuing that, you might find some relief and resolve some of your childcare issues. Um, how many days a week are you in school?"
"Its-its 3pm on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday nights, so I have class on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday"
"okay. ok. ok. Um, so what would it look like if you had a plan where both your neighbor and your mom helped you out?"
"Um, well, if my neighbor could even just take over one day of watching my son, I think that would help my mom quite a"
"okay. ok. ok. So what I hear is, if you could just reduce the amount of time that you need your mom, she might be more supportive, more onboard?"
"I mean, I think so, yeah."
"Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. Um, so what are your next steps in working out a plan between your neighbor and your mom?"
"Talking to my neighbor and seeing if she even wants to be in this idea, and, you know, hopefully,"
"okay. ok. ok. Sounds like you got a good plan to follow up on there. Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. Um, now you mentioned that your son is 2. When will he turn 3?"
Just a couple months from now. #TDF2019. Almost 3.
"okay. ok. ok. Well, in that I--in that case, I have another idea for you. Um, what about, um, maybe when he turns three, you could enroll him in Head Start. Are you familiar with that program?"
"I heard of it, but I dont know that much."
"okay. ok. ok. Head Start is a very affordable, very high quality preschool program. Um, it was really created for parents and families, just like yours, folks with lower income and fewer resources, but Head Start. Um, and you may discover that routine is something that gets him to get used to before he starts kindergarten. Uh, would you like some more information on local Head Start sites?"
"Yeah, I mean, it sounds like it would be really good for my son and, you know, it would help me out in terms of childcare"
"okay. ok. ok. Well, good. Good. Good. Um, all the same. Sounds like you have a good plan there going forward. Um, now I've seen from the nurse practitioner notes, you also have to work on reducing your smoking and your drinking. How did that happen?"
"[chuckles] Well, you know, I-I've been working on this for a few weeks now, and honestly, it's been a lot harder than I expected. break my routine in the evenings, especially has-been hard, but, um, you know, a few nights I reach my goal in terms of,. So, I mean, Ive done okay some days, but others, not so much."
"okay. ok. ok. So what I hear is that it was a bigger challenge than you expected, yeah, but you're working on it. You- you still commit. So yeah, that's really commendable. Im just trying to ask one thing tho. Have you thought about secondhand smoke and the dangers that might impact your son?"
"Yeah, yeah. Definitely got, so I-Im trying to never smoke around him, and if I do smoke at home I always go outside to"
"Oh, okay, good. I can tell you real heart here that you have your son's best interests at heart. I can tell you are a really good mom, just from our conversation today. Um, let's reflect back on what we have discussed so far. We have a few good options between the neighbor and Head Start programs for childcare now. What are your next steps in getting that going?"
"Um, well, I guess just first talk to my neighbor and see if she likes this idea, and then if she. Hopefully that helps her situation out. And then, um, I definitely want to look into the Head Start idea because I think that would be really"
"okay. ok. ok. ok. Good. Good. Good. Good. Um, I think you have a good plan there. We getting back together, say, in 2 weeks, just to see what kind of progress youve made, you know, if. We need to come up with another plan"
okay. ok. ok.
"Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. Good. Good. Good. Good. Well, Sarah, I'd like to thank you again for coming out today. I really felt like meeting you was so sweet"
Thanks. For the follow. Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok.
You're welcome. You're so welcome.
Hi Emily. Thanks for the follow!
Hi. Nice to meet you.
It's been a while.
"Yeah, it's been a while."
This is something new.
Lol Oh Oh The RatioYeah
Got your lip pierced. How long ago did you get that done?
About a month.
Hmm. Interesting.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
What made you decide to get-get a lip piercing?
"Um, I'm not sure. Something different just made me feel some type of way. I've been getting bored and, I don't know, it's kinda nice to stand out a bit, I guess."
Hmm. Interesting.
"Yeah, change."
"Yeah, and looks pretty."
Thanks. For the follow!
"Um, I guess, as your dentist, I have- I have a few concerns about lip piercings, oral piercings. I'm wondering what have you heard about how having an oral piercing can affect your-your-teeth or your gums?"
"Im not actually, actually. I-I mean, I'm sure that might push on my gums or teeth, but I don't know how much that will impact that. I have pretty teeth. I'm not sure."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
I'm not really sure [unintelligible 00:01:04]
You're doing that. You're doing. your teeth are beautiful as always-
[Laughs] Thanks.
-every time you come in.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Um, I mean I've had some oral piercings and they can erode some of the gum right, um, just right at the front."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Um, so that's one-one thing, and the other is, um, I see fair amount of chipped teeth-"
Lol. Yeah.
-Just from contact. Wonder what are your thoughts on that?
"Definitely not wanting this mess with my teeth. I know I kinda already have low gums to begin with, like you told me for a while, and I have to flo-floss, which I-"
Yes. Flossing.
"Um which I don't do but, um, yeah, I guess, I don't really have to ruin my teeth 'cause--"
Nothing yet.
guess i didnt pay attention
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There was certainly-- There was no problems and you, as you said, only had it for a short time."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Um, what would- what would make you decide, ""This is something that's not right for me""?"
"I dunno, I guess if I started seeing that it was actually causing a problem, then I might"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"But for now-- I mean, just got and-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
-and it looks pretty cool.
I guess that does.
"Yeah, I kinda-- Yeah."
"Yeah, looks pretty cool. So, you want to monitor it and-and-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-really watch-
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-the effect? the effect? the effect. okay. ok. ok.
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I guess if I really start seeing a problem-- I mean, this might not last forever, but my teeth, I h"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
-will kind of stick [unintelligible 00:02:30]
Emily you said it so well it-
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-the- piercing might not last forever but your teeth really do-
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"-hopefully forever. So, okay, well thank you for-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"-with me, and also before I do the exam, you know I'm always on your case about flossing, so maybe we can take [inaudible 00:02:46]-"
"So many different directions that we could take. Um, you mentioned wanting to make changes in your physical activity. You mentioned wanting to make changes in your eating habits and also just wanting more body confidence. Um, what- what is on your mind as far as a- as a change topic for the rest of our session today?"
"I'm starting to think the activity piece is the low hanging fruit that I see. I mean, I can change some of my nutrition habits right out the gate but if I can get into maybe an activity routine, that could be"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. okay. ok. ok. So physical activity feels like the easiest change to look at first.
"Yeah, I think so."
"Awesome. Great. So tell me a bit more about your motivators for getting started in being more physically active. I know you shared energy levels and I know you shared, um, that you'd like to see a boost in your mood and feeling less irritable. Any other benefits that really make you wanna make this change right now?"
"Yeah, I think just to feel like physically stronger, um, like physically more able, I think. Uh, I like struggled with the jar of salsa last night, like opening it. So I think that just stuff like that, um, you know, would be in addition to mood and being more productive and energy and all that. Um, yeah, that would be a definite end goal for me too. Also, I think if I get more active, I think my body image or my body confidence would improve also."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So you want to feel stronger so that you can open jars and other stuff and- and also just have a better sense of
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Awesome. Great. So on a scale from zero to 10, zero being not at all ready to make physical activity, and 10 being let's-. I'm excited. I'm excited. I'm ready. I'm ready. Um, where- where do you fall on that scale?"
"Hmm, I would say I'm about an 8."
okay. ok. ok. So you- you feel fairly motivated
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Uh, why didnt you pick a six?"
"Well, like I said, I just, I think a lot of things that I think would be good. Um, if I was to be more active and definitely want that improved mood and energy, um, and feel better about myself. Um, so yeah, all of those things I think are what drives that- that rating."
"okay. ok. ok. You notice there- too many great benefits to being physically active and, um, today you mentioned energy, mood, strength and body"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
Am I missing something else?
I'm not okay. I'm not okay.
okay. ok. ok. Those are the big ones for you
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Fantastic. Fantastic. Well, um, now can we start looking at if you're interested in how that might look-"
Mm-hmm yeah.
"- and- and- and- what activities you might end up, um, choosing."
"Yeah, that would be awesome."
okay. ok. ok.
"Well, thank you Tanya, for meeting me today and talking about this. I would like to know that we can kind of discuss in our conversation is what is one thing about yourself or something in your life?"
"Um, well, I have a lot of anxiety, and so there's this test that I have to take. This is a big test and I kinda put it off just because I get very anxious. I'm not trusting in myself that I can do good at something. Um, and so that's something that's been on my mind for many years and it's like, I gotta just do it. Um but I always stop myself from doing that because of the anxiety. And I'm just trying to, I'm not trying to feel that way"
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This anxiety is this obstacle for you and it sounds like it, then you just dont feel confident that you could do it and do"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"And so, it makes it easier to just not do it."
"Exactly. Exactly. So, just avoid it and put it off."
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, on a scale from 1 to 10, 1 being not confident at all, 10 being very confident. How confident are you that you can manage your anxiety in regards to taking this exam?"
"Um, maybe like a 4 or 5"
"okay. ok. ok. So, 4 or 5. How combat, like, not like a 2 or 3."
"I mean, I-I still have it set up after like so many years, so I still have a ton of anxiety about it, but I think. And so this is why I would rate it like a 4 or 5 because I make that first step but it still looks scary"
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, and you also mentioned that you actually made the appointment that you have to take this exam"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
And before you put it off.
"Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. After s-scheduling this too, I'm already kinda putting it off. So, um, now I actually enjoy that because I-I already like changed date and all that. So its actually coming out now"
"okay. ok. ok. So, youve made this appointment before in the past and the anxiety has kind of taken over where you resched"
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes
And this time it seems a bit different this time. How come you feel like you might not reschedule this time around?
"Um, well I think this is the type of long time coming. Just need to do this and then figure out, if I dont pass, I need to wait 3 more months to do it. And then I just gotta study for the next 3 months. And if I do, then I can have that weight lifted off my shoulders cause it's been all weight on me and I think about it every day. And I just hate thinking about it"
So this is really encouraging you to think about how good you'll feel afterwards once it's done and taken.
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But then I do worry, you know, that negative talk that, you know, when you have anxiety. I worry about if I dont pass it, like people are going to ask me how I did and if I didnt. Um, so this makes me really anxious."
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yall kinda wanna avoid that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Have those other feelings that could come up and if you dont have them, youre not good."
Right. Right. Right.
I would love to hear from you. When was the last time you felt anxious about something and actually did it and it turned out well?
"Uh, I'd say maybe like 4 or 5 years ago, um, I had to do a recording for work and I didn't want to. Me during this recording trying to find every way that I can get out of. And, um, and then I played my recording and because of the way sometimes I carry myself, like not confident and very anxious"
"Um, when I played the recording it actually ended up being one of the best recordings and like my supervisor and our national consultant. So I thought, I'm not really a fan of compliments that make me, um, anxious too people compliment me but it was a nice feeling. And to know that I've done a good job."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Um, this made me feel good."
"So, in that experience, it really built up your self confidence and it almost not only changed the way you see yourself, but"
"Yeah, I've done that."
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And that must have been brave for you to do something that seems intimidating at first, yet you were"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Um, how could you possibly relate that to what you are dealing with now?"
"I mean, I think again, like all that anxiety, the same anxiety I had with those tests. Um, but if I pass this test, if I could have that same feeling that I had, like when I did a good job like the--"
Mm-hmm
You know. You know.
So for you to create opportunities to create those moments that you can have that feeling again
Right
"And yall just mentioned too, feel proud of yourself"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"So to end our conversation, how do you think you couldnt move. You originally said, you're at 4 or 5, what would have to happen to get you to like a 7, to feel more confident?"
"test coming in a few days, um, I think, for me and just like practicing and just really seeing how I do and if"
Mm-hmm
"And maybe just having that faith in myself that, you know, that I can do it instead of just thinking that I can"
So that positive self talk could really go a long way for you?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"So to recap, sounds like you are still feeling kind of anxious about this test coming up, you resched it, um, over the past few years. Yet, you seem more confident to just get it done this time around. And you even mentioned times in the past where you felt anxious and you were successful about it and that. And you liked the way this means, you see yourself and how others see you, and it seems like y-you are ready to finish this exam?"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"okay. ok. ok. Well, thank you Tanya."
Thank you. You are welcome.
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Good, so, um, here we are today to talk just, uh, about whatever it is you would like to talk ab"
"Um, how about if we talk about, uh, the problem that I really have, getting somebody motivated to do something,"
"So what you are, what you are trying to do, um, well, tell me a bit more about it so I understand it a bit"
"Well, I-I've been offered my home to somebody and, uh, for, uh, a transitional period."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"I feel like, um, it's hard for me to be assertive and say I think the, um, transition is-. So. Much. Fucking."
"So this is a really kind thing of you to do to take someone into your home like that when they need help. Right now you think, uh, time is up you'd like to get this person, you know, you're-you're-ready to have him or"
"Definitely right that I want, I-I want change but I am not, I am kind of, like, weak in that area where it. You're right, yeah. I wish I was able to do this"
"Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. And what would, uh, help you get to the point of actually, um, booting them out?"
"Um. Is. That. Okay. I dont know, I feel like I know, I guess, I care about the person and, you know, there is a certain amount of comfortability"
"Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. So you kinda feel two ways. Um, you feel like at some level that the time is up for that person to go, and on the other hand, there's a certain amount of security"
"Yeah, you know, it kinda kinda kinda kinda kinda kinda kinda kinda kinda kinda kinda kinda kinda kinda kinda kinda kinda kinda kinda kinda kinda kinda kinda kinda kinda kinda. [Laughs] Andphaloid"
But you aint ready if you wanna sing that song
"[Laughs] Well, first of all I think he would hit the road if I started singing that song 'cause I can sing. [Laughs]"
"I thought you did a pretty good job singing there right there, its scary to be quite honest with you and I appreciate, I also"
"Well, in life you have to have a sense of humor in my- the way I view and otherwise, youd be like. [Laughs] Either Goldberg or Brownstein."
Being able to laugh about things helps you get through things.
"I mean, even comedians say, you know, most of-- What I've heard about comedians is that they are. [Laughs] Kinda, maybe I should go into that. [Laughs] Like this girl Cynthia"
Your new career.
"Yeah, like this girl Ruth that I know shes-shes, uh, got a serious job and she kinda does that on the side. [Laughs]"
"So, um, what are the uh, uh, what would you have to gain from having him out of the house?"
"Mm. the mf. Lets see. Well, I kinda dont, you know, I kinda dont, you know. Um, I'm having a hard time with that one. Um. Is. That. Okay"
tell me a bit more about that
"Mm, well, gotta really think about it because-"
Some guilt? Some guilt?
"Yeah, yeah. I may be going back and forth a bit, you know, maybe some guilt and I, um, just, [sighs]"
Uh-huh. Uhhhh.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Cause yall wanna do the right thing because yall are- because yall are a good person and that's a- that's a
"Yeah, I- I- yeah. I mean I- thank you. I-I-I appreciate you saying that I'm a good person. Like I feel I am. Umphaloid"
But you did your part. Duty is done.
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oops, it just hit hard to- it just hit hard to, um, er, yeah. My j- my job is done and I have to start realizing that I have to be a bit more assertive, I think, and a bit more,"
"And so, what have you done in order to start getting them to Hit The Road, Jack?"
"Um, Ive had co-conversations about with him and sometimes not-so-pleasful, but I- I happen to just-. And finally I- at-one point I was really, y'all, very logical about this. And then the other day I kinda sorta got not so logical about it"
okay. ok. ok.
[Laughs]
"So, uh, you were telling me earlier that you talked to some other people and he has some options about some other places to"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Thats the good thing that he does. And I mentioned them. I-I-I discussed that with him.
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"And that gives me a relief- a sense of relief. Like I'm not just, y'all know, saying yeah. I mean, there are places where he has a safety net to go to and that-that makes it easier to discuss and"
"So, you might have to literally like pack his bags and help them get to those places, um"
"Been there, done that. [Laughs]"
okay. ok. ok. Are you-- This is something you have done before.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
So whe-when-
"Well, um, I've told him within a few days is, you know,. I think, um, I- I- cause I have future plans, um, and some things that are up in the air with me as. Ive had this place for 7 years but I dont trust, you know. Every day is a new- a new, uh, winding road that we're going down, you know?"
"Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm."
Um. Is. That. Okay
And its kinda creepy
"Lol, yeah, yeah. But, you know, and it's terrifying to have an extra, a giant extra trunk that you have to carry with you [chuckles]"
And its that extra trunk.
"Yeah, yeah."
okay. ok. ok.
"But I-I mean and it's not that I don't care about him, I do, but. But yall know, its just like, we both- we all adults here, come on."
"okay. ok. ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. So, it sounds like you-you actually worked this out until be out within a few days."
"Um, that's the goal, you know."
okay. ok. ok.
And I dont know what his plans are but those are my plans
"okay. ok. ok. Well, I have a funny feeling your plans will prevail. [laughter]"
Girl I like your way of thinking. I-I'll tell him that. [Laughs].
"Well, thanks for-for talking and playing with our little things here at"
Thank you
"So uh, I guess the issue is that, um, you know, my doctor seems to think that my-my blood pressure is high, but. And you know I eat real well. Um. Is. That. Okay. And, yall, she suggested that, um, I watch my caffeine but really, caffeine is not a problem for me"
"okay. ok. ok. Um, but we were talking a bit earlier-- earlier in our conversation, you said that you felt that it might have caused some of your ag. So it's a bit of, I don't know, what-- Um, so where are we. Did-did you--did you feel like you do have some agitation out of your coffee, or is it just no problem at all?"
"Sometimes it makes me jittery and, y'know, I need to go to the bathroom more often than some of my co-workers, but--. But you know, it-keeps me awake, it-keeps me aware, it-makes me more able to like, you know, do my job better. And so I really dont see that its a-it really is an issue"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Um, you know, and-and-maybe-maybe-my blood pressure is a bit high, but disproportionate"
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So let me see if I had this. So y- so yall got some positives, the- awareness, and then feel kinda on your game?"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Um, some negatives with, um, your-your co-workers, um, that they don't, you know, check-"
Right. Right. Right.
"-on the hospital floor, for frequent."
"Gotta stay on, yeah."
"Yeah, yeah, and then the blood pressure thing. Is this about right?"
"Yeah, yeah. Well, you know, and sometimes, like I said, it does kinda make me jitter and, um, I don't know. I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I. I-I really like it, and-and like I said, it makes me more aware of what's going on and-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. How about frequency. Do you feel good on how much coffee you drink?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm about 4 cups a day
okay. ok. ok. okay. ok. ok. And that feels about right?
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I-- I mean, it's the co-workers that-that work at night. Gosh they bring in a carafe"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"And, uh, I can only imagine-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-what- their bodies are like.
"Yeah, yeah. What would happen if you--if you looked at, maybe reducing that with that habit. Would that get rid of maybe some of the problematic things?"
"Reduce it, like-- what are you talking about?"
The number. Is. Number. Just the number.
"Yeah, yeah but, how-how much are we talking?"
"I'm not-- you're telling me. Um, you drink 4 a day, I mean-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
Um--
"You probably-- you know, because I-I gotta have that morning cup, I really-- you know I really like waking up and-. The, um, making the coffee and-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-I'm just really in love with the flavors.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
So I-I definitely dont want to give that up but differentiation
Gotcha. Gotcha. Gotcha. okay. ok. ok.
Uhphal relationship
So that one is important.
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"And, of course, working a 12-hour shift, I-I really think that, you know, the afternoon to keep me going till the evening is-is a"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Mid morning could probably get me up
That sounds awesome to me.
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
I'm thinking so. So you identified one of the 4 that might-- you might be willing to-to-t
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
-for a while to-to let go of. What do you- what do you think of this?
I'm thinking that sounds all right
okay. ok. ok.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Good. Good. Good. Good
I'm thinking I could do that
-- doing today?
"I'm good, thanks."
Good. Good. Good. Good. Why is it so hard to fill me in on what's been going on since I saw you last?
"Um, I guess everything is okay. I think my caseworker mentioned something about community service that I need to do or something. I'm not sure."
okay. ok. ok.
I don't know that.
So she talked to you a bit about it but sounds like you kinda know the details
"Yeah, I know that she said I need to get so many hours in, but I- I don't-. I kinda was half listening"
okay. ok. ok. So why dont you tell me what you remember from having your case manager call you. What do you know so far about community service?
end of my probation except I forgot like how many hours or if I find this or someone else is
"Okay gotcha. So, you know, that needs to get done-"
"Yes.-you know, you're still on probation-"
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes
-but you're a little fuzzy on details.
"Exactly, yeah."
"okay. ok. ok. Um, so maybe if it's ok with you, I can share with you some of, um, the requirements, maybe go over the details a bit more."
"Yeah, yeah."
Is this all right?
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Oh, cool. Great. I know you have 25 hours left to do, um, so that does need to get through your probation, and your case manager a. So I know in the past some clients have done their community service at food pantries or shelters, or anywhere in the community that. Um, urban ecology centers are a really good place to start. Yall can kinda work outside, work with younger kids. Do any of these options seem like a fit that you might be interested in?"
"Um, yeah, I'm just, so I'm still going to find the community service hours myself?"
So that means you can work with your case manager on that.
okay. ok. ok.
"So, um, that's something you can absolutely ask her or quest- or me some questions about, but they'll come and bring"
okay. ok. ok.
"-of places you can work with, some phone numbers to call."
okay. ok. ok.
"I kinda wanna see you do on your own but if you really feel like you struggling, those phone calls that either you and I can make"
"Okay, so I'd do that. And then do you know, can I get all the 24 hours in like a weekend or how does that work?"
"Well, 24 hours in a weekend sounds to me like it might be a lot of time."
[unintelligible 00:02:20]
I can- I can hear that you are really eager to just get it finished-
Lol. Yeah.
"-and get it out of the way. helpful for some other clients to sit down and take a calendar and just mark out, ok, I do like 5 hours this day, 2 hours. Is this something that might help you?"
"Yeah, I think, just to keep track of it better."
okay. ok. ok.
This sounds like a good idea to me
"And then, you know, it might be, I definitely think that if you commit and it's summer break,"
okay. ok. ok.
What other questions do you have for me about community service?
"That's what I think. I think I was just worried about who was gonna do it for me but I know I gotta, I guess, do it myself and that 25 hours. This sounds like the time I would have to get through"
"Yup, absolutely."
okay. ok. ok.
But you know that if you have any more questions you can always come to me or your case manager and we are here for-
"Well, thank you. Thats a good thing."
You're welcome.
"Right. Right. Right. Hi Ruth, thank you for coming out today. How are you?"
"Um, okay. Thats okay. Just, idk why I even do this anymore. I-I'm just so stupid. I'm such an asshole. I didnt know what the point of this is. I'm just- I'm just keeping doing the same thing over and over, even though I know it can kill me. I'm just, I'm not willpower anymore ma'am. Yeah, [foreign language]."
"Well, Ruth, it sounds like you are very frustrated first of all. And you say you just tired. You have lost all your willpower."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
You're not going to continue.
"Nah, cutting myself is the only way out. And I'm just getting suicidal thoughts and [foreign language], I'm just very, very like depressed and what's going on at home"
"So you feel real, real like youve had it up to here"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You- you are tired. You are stressed. You are overreacting. The point is that you feel so sad that you can feel something other than what you feel right now.
"Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Sometimes a pain in-in. It is, uh, to [unintelligible 00:01:27] handle and- the pain inside of me."
So youve been in a lot of pain?
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. I'm. So. Fucking.
I'm sorry to hear that. Feeling all that pain and not being able to do anything about it must be very frustrating. And it seems like the only thing that you can do right now is cry.
"Yeah, yeah. Suicide."
Its okay Ruth. I understand. Pain inside. Pain outside. Pain inside
[foreign language]
"So your mom doesnt understand you and doesnt have a dad, thats around?"
"Yea cuz she a single mom and struggle a lot. I wanna help her but I cant help her. So this just makes me sad. She will be okay, I feel like if I dont live anymore. And she wouldnt have to worry about me or pay my stuff"
"So you feel your hands are tied, you feel like you're a burden to mommy. She is a single parent. She works a lot. Yall have all these issues. And it sounds to me like you feel that you just added more problems to her."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"And if youre not alive, thatll solve the issue for her. She'll do better."
I-I think so?
How is she gonna be better off without you
Because it wont be a burden to her.
And how are you a burden now?
"Because she has to pay for my food and my uniform, um, to have a roof over our heads."
And how do you help her now?
"Um, Im trying to be a good kid. Tried to go to school. I may not have the best grades but I'm not failing any classes."
"okay. ok. ok. Ruth, and talking to me and opening up and telling me that you don't feel like you want to continue moving in and. And shows that you care. At the end of the day, care about your mom and that, in the end, doesnt sound like you wanna leave her alone. So much that you care about her so much, but right now the immediate solution that you have in your mind, it seems"
Thats the correct one.
"-How could it be the right one. Ending your life hurting yourself when it's just you and your mom. And you just said, shes a single parent. She's not married, you're not married. Its just the two of you. So how could that be the right choice. But I understand your pain and I know where youre coming from. And I know that the release that you feel physically is something that helps you in the moment. Are there other things that we can help you find to start replacing, um, that behavior?"
"Um, I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I just, uh, can't believe it."
"You don't know. You don't know. So much on your mind right now. Just opened up to you. I was told that youve been cutting, that you also thought that you were going to hurt yourself, killing yourself, not being here. Short-term, the cutting helps. Mama makes you feel like a burden, that stresses you out. This makes you sad. We see how much you struggle but also on the same hand, we see how hard you try and how hard you are to. Good to know your attendance. Youre trying to keep up your grades, even having A in math, which we know was the lowest grade you had all semester. So all of these things shows how much effort you put in and we see that effort. So you do what you can and it feels normal to feel like sometimes it's not enough. But that-that's what we're here for so that you can tell us those things and help us"
"Thank you ma'am, feeling better"
"Oh, thank you Ruth. Thank you for coming out today"
okay. ok. ok.
"I wanted to talk to because I was on Facebook the other day and saw some photos that are kind of concern to you and some of your. Like, idk what you doin' drinking. This will ruin your life"
"Um, I mean, it was just the, like, social gathering. Uh, the drinks were there and I--all my friends did this and it was just--it's-it's-not something that I like do occa-"
"But, Tommy, there are so many consequences with drinking. Yall arent even 21 yet, you could get arrested, you could, you could, have a drunk driving accident. You could, you know, mess up your schoolwork. your future is so bright. This is just really, really concerning"
"I-I'm getting what you're coming from but I-I really did. I-I thought that I had it under control and didnt let myself get too far gone. I-I didn't want to be, um, how do I put this. I want it to be in control and I wanted to make sure that all my friends are okay, so I didn't let myself drink too much"
"There really is no such thing as not drinking too much. I mean, anything that's drinking when you're underage is drinking too much, you know. Just like, think about all the things that can go wrong with you."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I-I understand exactly what you are saying. And Ratioing
How much are you drinking?
"I-I'm not that drunk. I mean, it's-it's mostly for social gatherings. Like it's nothing that I do, like by myself or whatever. It's just thephalic"
Is it like every weekend?
I would say every other weekends
"Tommy, I just want to know, can you think of anything better than this?"
"Um, I-I guess I can. I-I can probably be more productive in my schoolwork and rather than going out to parties as much and I-"
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Is--are your friends the problem, like maybe you should just start hanging out with more kids in the youth group and not hang"
"Yeah, I guess I havent put it on myself. I guess it really forced their account. And I just followed in their footsteps just to-- just because it seems like what they do is a lot of fun. And just want to make sure that I get every bit of the high school experience that I can get"
"Well, there are some things that seem fun in the moment that we know arent a good choice, right. Thats some of the things we talk about all the time is making good choices for our life and-. And I just, yall, I really think you should think about making a big change here."
Mm. the mf. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I-I see that maybe me drinking not as much would possibly have better my life to-to a certain degree. And I-- it makes a lot of sense. And I-I guess I can put more effort into sort of lowering drinking that constitutes
I'm starting to think you really need to quit.
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, alcohol is just so prevalent in our society and it just shows, wherever I go and parties and stuff that. I-I kinda feel like I should just, uh, get used to it or at least understand its, uh, effects before I should let it. I'm not- I'm not really seeing this as something that will completely destroy my life."
"You're wrong I think. Yall really be worried about this. Anyway, um, I wish you would quit. If all you do is cut down, that's better than nothing. I appreciate you talking to me about this but keep talking to me about it. This is really important."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I-I just-- I dont see the problem in it right now and maybe its because I havent had that traumatic of an experience but
Can yall wait for this to happen. Can you wait for a dramatic experience?
"You- you are correct. I-I'm not- I'm not too far gone before it's too late to go back. Like I-I can imagine something possibly happening where it is to a degree where I cannot escape. And I-I guess I never really had any-any real experience where the alcohol really affected me that much or anybody close to. So I guess this is something that I feel like I control, but in reality, I might not have as much control as I think."
"Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. Well, maybe it's something we can work on together. And, yall, I think we should come up with a plan that works for you so that you can get control here and stop drinking"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think that would be a good step forward into--and a life of possibly being sober and just experiencing the true- the
"Okay, sounds good."
okay. ok. ok.
"Ok Chris, so I need to talk to you because as you know, we have zero tolerance policy for drugs and alcohol at this school. And as-as athletic director, it is my job to check in on our student-athletes and make sure everyone adher. And I heard some chatter from some of the other kids about a party this weekend, and from what I can confirm or deny. Point where I can give you consequences but I did want to talk to you about whether or not you drink and how, you"
"Right. Right. Right. Actually, I'm trying to speak on something that happened during this past weekend. I usually, as, you know, am, um, an honor student. I usually study over the weekend and my parents arent letting me go out to parties but I kinda use that to convince. And when I got there, like I'm not used to this like party environment where everything you see in movies is kinda what"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"-or playing random games with alcohol, just to get drunk for no reason. I felt pressured to do and like conform to what everyone else was doing. So I wouldn't be- I wouldn't be ostracized."
"Yeah, you know, I get that. Like, we all have. okay. ok. ok. I was in high school ones too, you know, I was drinking too much. I'm getting this. Not a ton to do in this town a-and kids drink but, yall, promise we got these rules-"
I understand.
"-and youre on a team, stick to the rules."
"okay. ok. ok. Um, I know that's bad for me. This-this is bad for my body. Its bad for-for-for-being on the team, for being an athlete. This hinders my performance. Just, idk. I-I'm feeling that my-my friends pressure me. I'm not sure. I'm feeling I should like go with different friend groups. Maybe. Maybe not. I'm not sure."
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Chris, come on. You get peer pressure?"
"I dunno, like being in a sports team, y-you feel very, y-you gotta like be united with the group"
Yeah but you are one of the leaders
"Right. Right. Right. And as being one of the leaders, my fellow teammates expect me to lead not only in sports but also in social environments. And if that's a social- that's a social custom in our society. So dilemmaOUS"
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, maybe you can start leading as a non-drinker then."
"I could but that could also backfire on me. I'm feeling that I could be ridiculed for being, having a stick up my ass, you know."
"You are a star player, who will you pick on?"
"I mean, it's just one-- I'm just one person against the voice of the mob."
"Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. Yeah, yeah. Well, yeah. So the issue again I cant hear you drinking. Cant be hearing that youre at parties and can't see pictures on Facebook. I have to enforce rules at this school and at my job, you know. So, like I said, I get it, you know-"
I understand.
"-I don't know what it feels like. I-I'm getting that you want to have fun in your teenage years. This is what I get. But, you are a star player, we want to keep you on the team, we are a team. We've been getting to figure out a way to get through this. You know, we're going"
"Well, I'll dedicate the time, not to party and night. Well, not-not-not party, but, get involved with alcohol to that extent. And like, have it publicized on the internet."
What are you talking about?
"Like on Facebook, all the pics that you see on social media. I avoid those situations where I have to go to a party where I feel pressured to actually drink alcohol and allow what I do in my private time"
"Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. If youre going to be on the team, I mean we got to have a deal here. Okay? Okay. Okay. Okay"
Right. Right. Right. I'll stop. I'll stop.
Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. You're promising? You promise?
I'm going to promise.
Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. Shake. Shake. Shake.
Shake. Shake. Shake.
Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. I'll see you later
See you later.
Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok.
"Hi Laura. Lovely to meet you. So, thanks for coming in. I don't know how much you know about why you are here or what we should talk about. So, basically, I need to meet all the students in my school usually once or twice per semester. And we're going to talk about, you know, whatever's kind of going on in your life. I'll ask some questions about, you know, your goals and what you like for fun and those types of. And then we'll talk a bit about, you know, different behaviors and-and stuff like that. And so, it-it's pretty casual, pretty informal, just sort of a chance for me to get to know you if that"
okay. ok. ok.
okay. ok. ok. Why dont we start by just having you tell me a bit about yourself?
"okay. ok. ok. Um, my name is Laura and I'm 17 and I'm a senior in high school."
okay. ok. ok. And what do you like to do for fun?
"Um, mostly just hang out with my friends and stuff on weekends, things like that."
"Mm-hmm, and when you and your friends hang out, and what- what are you doing. Do you go to football games, go to parties?"
"School related, maybe like a game or two, or go to the mall, like, to shop or go to movies, and at night"
okay. ok. ok. And what kind of hobbies are you?
"Um, I like reading and I like going outside and, like, taking walks and, like, hiking and stuff. Im very outdoorsy so-"
Oh cool. Cool. What are your plans after high school?
"Well, I'm planning to apply to college and maybe, you know, have a good career and something like that, hopefully"
That's awesome. What do you think you're going to study?
"Well, I-I see journalism, maybe pre-law."
"Oh, neat. Nice."
-which is a little different but-
"Oh yeah, that's awesome. That's a really good goal"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Thanks. For the follow!
"It is, uh, hard work to get into law school. Are you doing well in school. What kind of grades do you get?"
"Yeah, I'm doing okay. I get mostly A's and B's, so I'm pretty, I'm okay, I'm okay."
okay. ok. ok. What classes are you not getting A's and B's in?
"Um, I think all my grades are A's and B's, so, yeah."
"okay. ok. ok. Also, do you know where you can apply to college?"
"Um, I don't know yet, but I'm looking into schools like in the area, so maybe, I don't know, maybe leave home or something"
"okay. ok. ok. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. And, you know, what made you decide maybe law school or-or journalism?"
"Um, I definitely don't have a math or science person so I decided to start looking at careers that maybe I. So-"
"okay. ok. ok. Awesome. Great. Sounds like you got, like I said, really good goals and you work hard in school. Um, you said that when you go out with your friends, you like hanging out and shopping and stuff like that and also go to parties?"
"Um, not really. Maybe one or two drinks at a time at a party at the most."
okay. ok. ok. And how often do you think you drink?
"Um, maybe like once or twice a month at the most."
Mm-hmm so like once or twice a month you have alcohol?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Okay, and so that may be like like 20 times a year."
"Possibly, yeah."
So that actually kinda makes a lot of drinking then?
"Yeah, I guess you can say that."
okay. ok. ok. What do you think is the most you ever had?
"Um, just two drinks at a time at a party at the most. I'm not-- I'm not a lot of people's favorite drink. I'm not--getting drunk is not something that appeals to me. So, I'm just getting, like, a drink in my hand, so my friends won't be bugging me about not drinking. Just looking like I actually do something. I dont even drink at all the time, most of the time. So-"
But you were drunk before?
"Um, no, not really, maybe tipsy, but not like drunk."
"okay. ok. ok. Um, so the most you ever, ever had is 2 drinks in a day."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"okay. ok. ok. Interesting. So, do you know all the bad stuff about alcohol?"
"Um, yeah, yeah."
"okay. ok. ok. Um, so one of the things that, yall, is really important to talk to teenagers about is drinking and driving. So, um, you know, that's actually a really big problem. And even around here we have kids die every year from getting in drunk driving accidents. So that's something that you really need to make sure you don't do, all the time. Have you ever done that. Have you ever got in a car-"
"Nah, Ive been driving and never got in a car with a drunk driver."
"okay. ok. ok. Uh, how much do your friends drink?"
"I have some friends that drink more than others, like, my close group of friends dont really drink as much"
"okay. ok. ok. What about at these parties you go to, are there other kids there that are drinking a lot?"
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think some of the kids are drinking way more than me. Definitely, yeah."
And hang out with them?
"Not really close, like, I know who they are and I'll say hi, but not-- They're not really, like,"
"Mm-hmm, so, you know, even just hanging around kids that are drinking a lot actually puts you at a lot more risk. Did you know that?"
"Um, yeah. Thats makes sense."
"I mean, a lot of the other dangers of drinking, like, um, not just car accidents, but you can have other accidents, you"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"You know, especially if youve been drinking then, you know, youre at a lot more risk because a man can take advantage of you. Did- you think about that?"
"Yeah, yeah, I'm having that. Thats, uh, one of the main reasons why I dont like drinking that much."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
So-
"And then, um, people get in fights more often when they've been drinking too much. Um, there have been a lot of kids, even at this school, who got in trouble because they were drinking and someone took pictures with their cell phone"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Parents find out and, we have a no-tolerance policy here about drugs and alcohol, and really can get you in trouble, and. Have you thought about that?"
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Definitely, yeah."
But you still drink.
"Um, yeah, I mean, I guess it's the thing to do at a rave, so-"
"Uh-huh. Uhhhh. So, I mean, do you think it's the thing to do if you wanna be an attorney?"
"Um, definitely not. Thats why I dont try to drink that much. Just-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"-make this look like me, kinda"
"Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. okay. ok. ok. Hmm. Interesting. So, I mean, I guess what we need to do then is kinda talkin abt some goals for how to be-"
okay. ok. ok.
-safer.
okay. ok. ok.
"Um, obviously, you shouldn't be drinking at all. Um, what do you think about that?"
"Definitely agree. I know that there are some other risks involved in alcohol, like, health-wise and things like that, so, I agree that"
"Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. So, can you quit?"
"Um, yeah, I mean, it's not, like, a really big part of my life, so."
"okay. ok. ok. So, I'll just go back to writing then that you decided to quit."
okay. ok. ok.
"And um, that's gonna be your goal, and that's awesome, you know, that's really why we're here, is to talk abou. Um, so, I guess, can you quit this weekend then?"
"Definitely. Yeah, definitely. Ill just not have a drink"
Okay and then what about your friends who are still drinking?
"Um, I really cant control what they do, but I will definitely try to get my closest friends to maybe stop"
"Okay, and-and what if they won't?"
"Well, then, I guess, just trying to hang around them less or something. I'll try to find things for us to do that don't involve alcohol like a party or anything"
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Probably if your friends quit drinking, you should just find new friends."
okay. ok. ok.
"Problem is if they drink, they pressure you into drinking and then you feel awkward and, you know, you'd be. If they- If they're the kind of people who are going to keep drinking-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-they probably arent a good influence
"Oh, yeah. Okay."
"You'll be better set for college too because, you know, the issue is you getting good grades now, but when"
"Definitely. Okay, yeah."
"Okay, so, um, that's awesome 'cause it pretty much covers all the stuff that I think I need to go over. Um, let's see. I guess we didnt talk about what would happen if your parents found out you were drinking."
They'd be pretty upset. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They dont really condone alcohol use.
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
So-
"Ok, so, yeah, just another reason why you probably need to just quit then. Um, okay, yeah. Like I said, I'll be meeting with you again probably in the next semester so we can kinda"
okay. ok. ok.
"-and you still dont drink and hang out with people who are drinking. Um, is there anything else you guys would like to talk about while you're here?"
Um no no no no no no no no no no. I'm thinking I'm good.
"okay. ok. ok. Um, any questions or anything-"
"Uh, no. No. No no no"
-like this?
I'm not even having questions.
"okay. ok. ok. You sure? You sure. okay. ok. ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. Um, well, that's probably it then. Head back to class and-and thanks for coming in."
"Okay, thanks."
"Hey, hi Andrea. Thanks for coming out today. So I dont know how much youve been told about why youre here but basically its my job just to meet all the. I usually meet with you once or twice a semester. And I will be talking to you kind of about your life and your goals and some behaviors that you might engage in and"
okay. ok. ok.
So why not start by telling me a bit about yourself?
"Uh, well, my name is Andrea, as you know, I am, uh, in the marching band. I'm playing the tenor sax."
Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I have music involved. So I also have the jazz band, wind ensemble, and um, yeah, that equals calcium"
okay. ok. ok.
I am an IB student.
okay. ok. ok. How long ago did you start playing saxophone?
"Well, saxophone. Ive been involved in music for about 10 years now, but Ive been involved in music for about 10 years now, so"
Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Thats long. What other instruments?
My first violin was a little bit of a mess. I started
No kidding.
"So Ive been playing that for like 6 years, once a clarinet, dabbled here and there with different things. And then I found the one- the one for me"
Thats awesome. And you're playing tenor sax?
"Yeah, the tenor sax."
Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. And how long have you been in marching band?
Marching band since freshman year. #GoGators. So like 3 years.
okay. ok. ok. Couple of years. Awesome. Great. And how do you like Marching Band?
"This is fun. Its a- its a lot of work, long summers taught but its fun"
What are your favorite parts about it?
Ooh I really like the-the-group setting
"Oh, okay. That's okay."
Getting to work with my other classmates and things like that. And putting on this entire show-
Uh-huh. Uhhhh.
"-it's very exciting, very energizing once you get in competition."
okay. ok. ok.
This is very cool.
Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. And do you have a lot of friends that are in band with you or-
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-friends outside of band or?
"I'm two-two separate groups, um, I'm two-two groups. Got my own friends from class and then my own friends from bra--from band."
okay. ok. ok.
So. Much. Fucking.
"Awesome. Great. And then, um, tell me a bit about your family?"
"Oh, well I have one brother he's older than me, about 9 years older than me"
Oh wow. Wow.
"And, uh, my parents and my dog. [Laughs]"
okay. ok. ok. What kind of dog are you?
He is a golden retriever.
"Oh, nice. Nice."
Charlie. Charlie. Charlie. Charlie
Charlie. Charlie. Charlie. Charlie
He is a big boy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Oh, cute. So cute. Have you had him for a long time?"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He's about 8 years old
Oh gosh. Thats it. That. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. okay. ok. ok. Very cool. Very cool. And what are your plans after high school?
"Uh, well, I'm planning on going to school. I wanna become a doctor one day so"
Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow
"I have a crush on psychology, psychiatry, something like that, so."
You have big dreams.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. Have you started thinking about schools or majors. I guess you think psychology is a major
"Yeah, psychology, I havent really thought too much about which school, I mean, I-"
Right. Right. Right.
Everyone wants to shoot for the Ivy leagues so [chuckles]
Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. And how about your grades?
"Uh, they're pretty, you know, high three-point somethings"
"okay. ok. ok. Good. Good. Good. Good. Very good. Well done. Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. Well, what are the types of things you do for fun on weekends?"
"Uh, I usually go out with my friends. Uh, we can go to movies or we can most likely just meet up at someones house-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
-and just hang out and things.
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. Is there ever alcohol when you hang out?
"Sometimes, [chuckles] I'll be honest with myself."
Uh-huh So how often do you think you drink alcohol?
"Um, depends on how much schoolwork there is When there isnt, it might be like every other weekend or like 3 weekends out of the month"
Lol so you drink a lot?
"A little, yeah."
okay. ok. ok. And how much are you drinking on the days that you-- on the days that you drink?
"Um, I'm not, we're not getting blackout drunk or anything. More like tipsy kind of thing"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
Got blackout drunk before-
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"-but kinda did that, learned my lesson, didnt like it"
Got it. Got it. Got it. So you-you had some pretty heavy drinking. What-what do you think is the most you ever had?
Like how many drinks?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Um, that was a good amount. Ive been drinking this for the first time and it was like 3 or 4 cups but it was mixing different things"
Okay so you dont even know
"So, I'm not-- Oh, yeah."
"okay. ok. ok. So, and then your friends drink too?"
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Not all of them, but some do."
okay. ok. ok. And how often do they typically drink?
"More or less the same amount. So right now the most we can have is maybe like 1 cup after that one time but sometimes one or two, but"
"Okay, so it's 1 cup, but it's not-not 1 drink."
"Oh, it's a red, you know, typical. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah."
Its got alcohol in it
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"okay. ok. ok. Um, so gosh, you- you actually drink quite a lot. Um, your level of drinking puts you in what we call a high-risk group."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"So, is this surprising?"
A little bit. A little bit.
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um, so we call it high risk because it means that there's actually quite a bit of chances that you. So, you know, things like, um, having car accidents, or other accidents, or getting in fights, or,. Have you thought about those things?"
"Not too much, to be honest. I-I always thought since it is, you know, within my small group of friends-"
Uh-huh. Uhhhh.
"-and we usually sleep over each other's house, we're not getting into the drinking and driving issues, and possibly sexual assault"
Uh-huh. Uhhhh.
But I havent really thought about possible alcoholism or anything
"okay. ok. ok. So it is, um, so good, because you don't drink and drive but you do drink a lot. Um, and yeah. okay. ok. ok. So, lets-let's talk a bit about that, how you might make some changes. Because I think you really need to- need to stop drinking like this."
okay. ok. ok.
"So, um, could you quit drinking or?"
"Yeah, I think I could. I'm not the one who needs this. For instance, it-is--it-is used as a kind of, like, let's get the party going."
Uh-huh. Uhhhh.
But we've never been always this-
Uh-huh. Uhhhh.
"-obviously. So, I think it would be possible to stop drinking."
"okay. ok. ok. So, does that mean you will stop drinking?"
"Um, I'd probably start off by like, because my friends are also involved, so I'd be like, ""Hey, guys, I don't think I'm drinking today."""
Uh-huh. Uhhhh.
And kinda see how that works. Because differentiation
"okay. ok. ok. Um, you're not that loud to sound like you think that works."
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Its, you know, one thing to control my own drinking, and its another thing when everyone else around me is drinking and then"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"-of, ""Oh, they'll think I look stupid."""
"okay. ok. ok. So, how are you gonna quit drinking without your friends thinking you look stupid?"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"okay. ok. ok. Um, so I mean, do you think they're actually good friends if they give you such hard time?"
"My close ones, I know they wouldn't, you know, have a problem with that,. But the ones that I'm not that close to, but still gonna like hang out with-"
Uh-huh. Uhhhh.
- those are probably the ones that like might ostracize me for something or.
They sound like you might be better off without them though. They’re-
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
- maybe not very good friends.
"Probably, might be too judgmental."
"Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. So, um, so I think we should set a goal that you stop drinking."
okay. ok. ok.
"And, um, I think you should probably stop as soon as possible, like this weekend."
okay. ok. ok.
"The way this normally works is, you know, we set you goals, and then I'll have you back and we'll talk again in a few weeks. Um, and so what do you think about that?"
"Um, I think-- I think the possibility."
okay. ok. ok. So-
"I'm thinking if you make a good plan, like I think I would be able to follow through with it."
"Oh, cool. Great. So, the plan is to quit and, um, the friends that you have that you don't think are supportive, you just, I guess, hang out"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm thinking I can do that
"okay. ok. ok. And then, um, like, are your friends in band drinking?"
"Um, not-not really. The ones that drink more are the ones like my classmates. My band mates, we’re focused on band-"
Uh-huh. Uhhhh.
-so that I can actually quantify
"okay. ok. ok. So, that might be good, is really just to focus more on band. Um because you know, the other big concern I have for you is if you wanna go to medical school, youll never get into"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Yall know like college is going to be real hard. And especially with all those premed classes, you can't handle that drinking this much. Have you thought about that?"
"Not too much, to be honest."
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. okay. ok. ok. So, setting this goal then quitting drinking is gonna be really helpful for you. And um, it sounds like i-it shouldn't be that hard really, um, especially because you can just stop hanging out with-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"-the people who drink a lot, um, since you have some other friends. Um, yeah. So, do you have any questions for me or?"
"Um, what should I--uh, yeah, I do. So what should I say like once, let me say, hang out with my friends and they say, ""Hey, why aren't you- why arent you-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
Like how should I go about that situation?
"Well, one good option would be to just review with them all the bad things about alcohol. I thought about this, and I realized it messes up my schoolwork. And you know, it's really a lot of risk for my health. ""I'm not an alcoholic. I'm a alcoholic."". Um, you know, ""I'm not getting liver disease. I'm just trying to stay healthy. "", ""I'm not afraid to end up driving drunk or getting into accidents-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"-or getting in fights."". One thing you could bring up is, ""I hear a lot of stories about kids you know, are at parties and actin"
Mm. the mf.
And you know thats for their social life. It's like over.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Sophalous
"And-and you know, like professional life as well."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Dont want that biting me in the ass, [chuckles] in the back."
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I think just tell your friends you know, you realized there are always bad things about it and you dont want to"
okay. ok. ok.
And then-
I'm thinking I can do that
-you can tell them to stop too. Well then that would be really good. You would be a good friend
"It would be easier as-- You know, as a group we-we all work together to become better."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. Any other questions or anything else I can help with?
No. No no no no no. I'm thinking- I think I'm good.
"okay. ok. ok. So, like I said, I'll be planning to meet you again in a few weeks."
okay. ok. ok.
And make sure that you actually quit drinking.
okay. ok. ok.
Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok.
Sound good. Sound good. Sound good
Awesome. Great.
So I know we determined that you sprained your ankle yesterday and I wonder if you can say a bit about how that happened?
"Um, this is really stupid. Uh, I was at a pub crawl last night and you know how pub crawls are. I get a few drinks and then I thought it was a really good idea to catch up with my friends who are, yeah,. So I just jumped off the bus and wore these like stilettos 'cause it was a 90s themed pub crawl. Anyway, and then I just like fell on my ankle. This was really embarrassing"
Sounds like a wild night
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
after that it was a lot of fun but I didnt do any dancing after that
"Nah, I suppose that would be the end of your, uh, shaking and moving. I know-- wonder if you would open up to exploring your alcohol use and what that looks like during the week."
"Uh, sure, uh, as long as we don't talk too much about like vodka 'cause I'm still, ugh, a little disproportionate"
You still feel the effects of-
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"-last night, are you?"
A little bit. A little bit.
Oh wow that was-
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-really rough night.
"Well, this is normal."
So what is a typical week for you as far as your alcohol use?
"Um, me and my friends kinda, uh, party on the weekends and, yall, we all have our university degrees and so it"
So a few drinks is nothing new to you?
No. No no no no no
And what does a few drinks look like. Is this per night. Is it 2 drinks?
"Um per night, uh, like if we go out oh, it's a lot. Its like I can drink probably like 7 or 8 drinks like if I go hard. Um, and then, like maybe when I get home from school, a long day at the library, have a beer or 2, so"
Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. Have you had any concerns at all about your alcohol use?
No. No no no no no. I-I'm not sure. I feel this is normal for university students
"Okay, so at this point, you don't care and you think that, you know, this is what the other students are"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Would you be open to looking at the low-risk drinking alcohol guidelines?
"Yeah, sure."
I'm not sure how you feel right now but I just want to know if we can take a quick glance at this-
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"-and what the safe limits are for women is 10 drinks per week with about 2 drinks per day, uh, per"
Oh really? Oh really? Oh really
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow
Where do you- where do you feel you're falling into that?
"Uh, uh I would say over that."
okay. ok. ok. ok.
Especially with midterms coming up.
"Okay, so this is kind of a way to cope through stress?"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Right, and is that something that has been, y'all, a way of coping for a while?"
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I guess."
okay. ok. ok. Does this concern you at all?
"Um, the 10 drinks seems like not a lot, uh, for like-for me and like my tolerance."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
I guess I kinda built it over the years
okay. ok. ok.
"Um, so that's a little- a bit, uh, concerning I guess to me."
Do you feel like you have any reasons to be kind of bringing your alcohol use down within the limits?
"Uh, any reason to. Uh, I guess health-health reasons."
tell me more about that
"Um, well, clearly I'm not feeling well right now. Um, and it's-- I definitely feel more productive when I'm not hungover. Uh, so I see a benefit."
So you can see some advantages to reducing the amount of drinking-
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"-um, that you consume during the week?"
Yeah
Is this something you would be willing to explore with me at another time maybe when you feel a bit better. Is this something you would be willing to come back and talk to me about?
"Yeah, yeah, I think when I feel a little- a little bit better, I think I can do. Maybe when I havent gone all out the night before and sprained my ankle"
"I would love to, uh, set up an appointment for you if you can come in later this week or early next"
okay. ok. ok. ok.
-kinda explore this a bit further and maybe some of those advantages of reducing to the safe limits. Is this something we could do?
"Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure. Yeah, just not on a Saturday morning. [chuckles]"
Thats okay with me
okay. ok. ok.
Thank you. You are welcome.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Sounds good.
"So let me tell you what I normally do in this, um, this interview, and we-we'll talk for up to maybe 20 minutes or so. Normally what I do is just give some feedback from all of those questionnaires that you answered last week-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"-and then we just talkin' about that. So, um, but I always like to just start as many places as you would like to start as well."
"[sigh] that, I mean, like, when I was doing those questionnaires, it was weird because, I mean, I"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"-ever really think about, like-like, how much I drink."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Um, and, like, fi- like filling out, like, how much I drink every day, it was like, WHOA,"
Hm. Thats a good idea
"I never really thought about it, like, that I was-- like, if I tried to actually count the drinks, it's,"
What you learned about your patterns shocked you.
"'Cause, like, I also, kinda, thought that, like, drank, like, about as much as my friends did and then,"
Hm. Thats a good idea
"-Saturday, Sunday."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"And then she was like, ""Sarah, that's cra-- Like, that's cra--. Why are, yall, like, where are you drinking this. And I was- I was like, ""Well, like, different places."". And I-I guess, like, I dont know, my friends didnt, like, know. Anyway, this is, yeah, I don't know."
"Yeah, some of the information opened your eyes in some ways and as you talked to your roommate about it, she was even shocked"
"Yeah, and yeah, I guess it was just like, I thought that everybody was, like, doing, y"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
-but that's not really what was going on. [chuckles]
"Yeah, the fact that your drinking stands out from other people clearly doesn't make you a lot of"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Yeah, so, that was the thing that, like, was really the weirdest thing to do those-"
okay. ok. ok.
-forms.
Hi Laura. Lovely to meet you.
Hi. Nice to meet you.
"Thanks for coming in. Um, so, I don't know how much you know already about sort of what you do here. I'll give you a breakdown if it's okay"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"I just wanna talk to you about sort of what your goals are for your life, um, get to know you a bit better and talk. I mean, judging me or trying to change you, is not my job at all, you know. I'll talk to you about how things are going, any changes you might want to make in your life, how I could help"
okay. ok. ok.
Is this okay?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Ok, so, I guess just to get started, can you give me a bit of your background?"
"Well, my name is Laura. I'm 17 years old and I'm a senior in high school."
"okay. ok. ok. Also, what kind of things do you plan for your life?"
"Well, hopefully, go to college, get, you know, good enough grades to get into a"
Hm. Thats a good idea
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
That's awesome.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Do you have a plan as to where you might want to go or not?
"Um, I don't know yet. I might have to apply out-of-state, maybe a few schools in the area."
Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh
"So, maybe move away for college."
Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"So, kinda keeping your options open."
Definitely. Definitely.
"Awesome. Great. And, do you have an idea of what you might want to study or?"
"Yeah, maybe um, pre-law."
"Oh wow. Wow. Oh, that's exciting."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Uh, what are you like for fun?"
"I like hanging out with my friends, maybe going to like a football game, or going to the mall to shop, or if there"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"- something like that, yeah."
You like having fun?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"And, you have a lot of friends or a few close friends, or?"
"Um, I'd say like a moderate amount. I really dont have friends that are actually-really popular or like, I have no friends."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"So, I'm like normal."
Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Thats a good way to be, right?"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [chuckles]
"Ok, so, um, sounds like, in general, your-- Things are going pretty well for you. How are your grades?"
"Um, they're pretty, As and Bs. So, Im doing okay."
okay. ok. ok.
Through college.
"Awesome. Great. Well, one thing I want to ask is, you know, different people have sorta different values or things that. They might, you know, be close with family or really have, you know, their friends as being something particularly. So, here are just a few things on this sheet, and if you can look at them all, I have. So, there are things like belonging, community, cultural identity, family, friendship, modesty, religion, respect. Which of those do you think is sort of important to you?"
"Um, family definitely, uh, friendship, and belonging."
okay. ok. ok.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
What is important to you about your family?
I-I love them so much that I want them to think well of me-
Hm. Thats a good idea
"-and I want them to, um, accept and love me."
okay. ok. ok. Are you brothers or sisters?
"Yeah, I have one sister."
"Oh, cool. Great. And, how about friendship?"
"Friendship, um, I have- I have many people that I care about. So, I'd like them to accept me as well."
"Awesome. Great. So, being a good friend and-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"-having people who are good friends, is important too. And then, what about belonging. You mentioned that one too."
Yeah just a sense of like fitting in and not-- And like getting accepted-
Hm. Thats a good idea
"-in general, yeah."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. want to be part of a group-
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"-and kinda. Oh, cool. Great. Okay, well, one of the things I wanna talk about is, yall, um, yall mentioned that yall wanna go out with friends and-. And, I'm curious, do you ever get any alcohol when you're out in the parties?"
"Um, not much, maybe like 1 or 2 drinks at most."
"okay. ok. ok. Hey, can you give me a bit of advice on how alcohol fits into your overall social scene?"
"Um, I'm pretty much just having a drink to just have it look like, so it looks like I'm drinking, even tho"
Hm. Thats a good idea
So maybe people wont bug me about drinking or something
"Okay, you kinda get pressure from other people who are drinking, and it feels easier for you to-"
Yeah just-
-kinda hold a drink.
-have one there and pretend to have it.
okay. ok. ok.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"And, do you think that, um, this is most weekends or occasionally. How-"
Um. Is. That. Okay
"-Mostly, you think that you are around alcohol."
Maybe one or two weekends a month at the most?
okay. ok. ok.
Not really much.
"So, one or two weekends a month youre in a situation where alcohol is involved?"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
okay. ok. ok. And what sort of situations are you in?
"Well, just I guess, at some rave or something, someone's house."
Uh-huh. Uhhhh.
"Or, even if it's not a party, like a small social gathering, maybe there'll be like a few beers around-"
Hm. Thats a good idea
-or something.
"So, mostly hanging out with friends."
"Pretty much, yeah."
"Are you ever, um, places where there are parents around or-"
Umphaloid
-or mostly just- just with the kids?
"Mostly just with us but, sometimes I'll go to like a close friend's house and like I'm close to a family as well. So, we can all just hang out."
"Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. And, what about driving?"
"Um, like drunk driving?"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Ever drive anywhere after you have had any alcohol in your car?
"Um, definitely not. I have never been in a car with a drunk driver and I never have a driver."
"okay. ok. ok. So, that's something that you sort of made a decision about. It sound like you Goldberg calculations"
"Yeah, because I know that's extremely dangerous, so."
okay. ok. ok. How is that dangerous?
"Um, well, alcohol definitely impairs your judgment. So, I mean, driving under the influence of alcohol can lead to like crashes and accidents and things like that, so"
"So, you really are trying to be safe and- make sure that-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-you don't put yourself-
Definitely. Definitely.
"-in those situations. That's awesome. I really admire you for being able to-stick with that, and I really commend you for being-"
Thank you. You are welcome.
"So, you mentioned, pretty much, you'll like hold a drink or maybe have a drink or two. What do you think is the most alcohol youve ever had in-in one day?"
Not more than 2 drinks.
"okay. ok. ok. So, the absolute most-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"-was 2. okay. ok. ok. And, what types of things do you like about alcohol?"
"Um, I never actually get drunk-"
Uh-huh. Uhhhh.
"-so, i can't really say that i like that feeling or not, but, its just like--"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
So. Much. Fucking.
"So, it just kinda makes you feel relaxed or?"
"Yeah, relaxed."
"okay. ok. ok. Uh, anything else?"
"Um, no, not really. Like I said, I'm not drinking that much-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"So, I-I wouldn't be able to say."
"okay. ok. ok. And, any not-so-good things about alcohol?"
"Um, definitely, yeah. Some people, um, that drink-- Like, drank too much, they start throwing up, or getting hurt, or they are loud and obnoxious"
"Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. So, youve seen a lot of other kids who-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-had some consequences-
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-and decided that's not for you?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Got it. Got it. Got it. I-I can understand that. [chuckles] Uh, any other things that you can think of?"
"Um, no, I mean, I never, you know, been friends with anyone that has gotten into like a serious accident and stuff. It's just-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"-very, like, obnoxious things."
"okay. ok. ok. Well, so, as someone who isnt 21 yet, it is-- Underage drinking is something that isnt legal-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"-and it's something that's considered pretty risky. So, I'm wondering what you think about that, just in terms of how it fits into your life."
"Um, I know that's definitely risky, but, I mean, I guess, we still do it. [chuckles]"
"Uh-huh. Uhhhh. So, it's kinda something that you factor in"
It's just there.
"It's just there? It's just there. okay. ok. ok. And, I'm curious, you mentioned, your friends are important to you, and your family is important to you, and,. How does alcohol play a role with that?"
"Um, definitely not in my family life, because my parents arent really condone-"
okay. ok. ok.
"-alcohol use, but, friendships, I mean, when I hang out with my friends, or we're at a rave or somethin,"
"okay. ok. ok. So, from your perspective, the drinking is not something that fits very well?"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"And with friends, you feel like it's easier to- hang out with alcohol, or maybe you wouldn't have as much fun,"
"I guess, I mean, since it's just there."
okay. ok. ok.
So-
Got it. Got it. Got it
-this ties in with the whole belong to me thing.
"okay. ok. ok. Well, when you think about your drinking and, sort of, look forward in 5 years or 10 years, how do you think that drinking"
"Um, it probably will have a very small role, if any-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
-considering I have big plans for my future. So. Much. Fucking.
okay. ok. ok. Can you expand on that a bit more. What are you talking about?
"I dont think I would, you know, drink as much or go to parties as much if I study for law school, or"
"Ok, so, the-alcohol is something that might make it harder to reach your goals?"
Definitely. Definitely.
"Um, so, how often do you think you might be drinking, say, when you get to college?"
"Um, maybe less than I am now. Im not a big drinker anyway so-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"-maybe, like, one drink every once in a blue moon."
"okay. ok. ok. So, you sort of have a plan to cut back on-"
Definitely. Definitely.
-your drinking eventually?
For sure. For sure.
How might that work?
"Well, I mean, I guess right now I would try to stop in high school, and once I get older, maybe just like, socially"
"Yeah, so, you dont feel the need to make any major changes, but you feel that you could make some changes that would"
"Definitely, yeah. Thats a good word."
"okay. ok. ok. How important is it to make some changes to your drinking, on a scale of 1-10. Where 1 is not at all important, not something you think about, and 10 is most important thing."
Maybe a 5 or 6.
And why did you say 5 or 6 rather than like 2 or 3?
"Because, um, it's not something I do not care about at all, but it's not something that's just constantly on my mind."
"okay. ok. ok. So, it's something you thought about or something you did."
"Yeah, yeah. Definitely. Definitely."
"okay. ok. ok. And, how confident are you that you could make a change if you decide you want to on that same scale?"
"Um, I'm pretty confident that I can considering that I'm not actually an alcohol user per se."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"I really dont have a crush on that whole scene so, its-it wont bedifficult for me"
"So, what number would you say?"
"Um, on a scale of 1-10-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
-if I can quit or not?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Maybe like an 8 or 9
Okay and why would you say 8 or 9 rather than even like 5 or 6?
"Because, like I said, it's not a big part of my life. So, not really that difficult"
"okay. ok. ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. Well, kinda keeping that in mind, sounds like, um, you do have sort of a-a vague plan to make some changes in your drinking at some"
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes
"-and, it's mildly relevant. Its something you would love to do because you have these big goals for yourself, and you actually feel confident that you could. What sort of goal do you think might be good to set for today?"
"Um, probably to stop, maybe next party I go to, not have a drink at all."
"okay. ok. ok. Um, do you feel pretty confident that you could just stop completely?"
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I can just tell my friends-- My pa-- My friends arent that intimidating."
Uh-huh. Uhhhh.
I think its just like outside people that I dont really know that well
okay. ok. ok.
"So, I could just tell them, ""Hey, I'm not feeling like having a drink today."""
What-what might some benefits of following through with that goal?
"Um, definitely, I'll have like all my senses there and I'll be aware of everything that's going on."
Uh-huh. Uhhhh. Anything else?
"Um, health concerns, I suppose. Alcohol is bad for your health I know"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"So, that would be one."
"okay. ok. ok. So, it sounds like you're actually comfortable setting goals of not drinking anymore a-at least at the next part. And seeing how that works."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
okay. ok. ok. If we met again to kinda check in on how it goes and- see if it works out for you?
"Yeah, that would be cool."
"Well done. Great. And then, i-it sounds like some of the benefits you expect are, um, health benefits-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"-having an easier time achieving your academic and career goals, and just sort of not having to deal with some of the consequences that your p"
Right. Right. Right.
"okay. ok. ok. Very good. Well done. Um, is there anything else that you think would be important to know?"
"Um, how would you, um, advise me to like get maybe my friends to stop drinking?"
"Oh, that's a great question. So much for trying to cut back, kids who are trying to cut back, it's harder if their friends are still drinking, and"
"Oh, yeah. Okay."
"-Of course, that's harder if you're not the one making the plans. if youre at a rave say, um, and there are other kids that maybe arent your closest friends, um, some of the things that. So, you know, even carrying an empty beer bottle or beer can or, you know, if people are having a mixed drink,"
Oh okay. Thats okay.
"- without the alcohol mixed in it. Um, often, having anything in your hand is a good barrier for people who are trying to offer you alcohol, because you"
"Yeah, that's a good idea."
"-and it- kinda, um, prevented them from trying to stuff something else in there. Does anyone have any of those things that might work for you?"
Yeah for sure.
"okay. ok. ok. What about talking to your friends about it, have you thought about how you might approach with them or is that something else"
I mean-
-to stop drinking.
-I was just planning on telling them that I'm not really a drinking type anymore. That wasnt me.
Uh-huh. Uhhhh.
So. Much. Fucking.
Your friends would be pretty comfortable with that?
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. For sure, at least my closest friends, for sure."
"Oh, cool. Great. Any other concerns or questions. Anything else I can help with?"
"No. No no no no no. Nah, I think I'm okay."
"okay. ok. ok. So then, like I said, um, I'll try and see if we can meet up maybe in a few weeks and see how"
okay. ok. ok.
"-and then, um, if things are going well, then fantastic, and if you run into any stumbling blocks, then we can"
"Oh, cool. Great. Thanks. For the follow!"
That sound okay?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. Thanks so much.
No problem. No problem.
"Thank you for coming out today Katie. Looking forward to getting to know you, and maybe just start sharing some about you and what brought you in today?"
"Uh, yeah, sure. Um, I guess, well, my doctor referred me to see you. Um, I guess he has some concerns about, um, my- my pregnancy and- and my baby. So, um, yeah, well, I do what I'm told."
So you followed through on meeting me today and you mentioned he has some concerns. Can you say a bit more about that?
"Uh, yeah, he's concerned about my alcohol intake."
okay. ok. ok. And I wonder if you have any concerns about that.
"Uh, no. No. No no no"
"No. No no no no no. okay. ok. ok. So that's- that's not been an issue. Uh, its an issue for him and not for you at this point."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
okay. ok. ok. So what about maybe sharing a bit about your alcohol intake and maybe a bit about what your- what your life is like?
"Um, okay. Thats okay. Uh, well, I guess I drink like a glass of wine at supper every night, and just to, relax with my friends if I go out. So wine has always been a kind of family tradition with supper. So-"
okay. ok. ok.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"So it was kinda sorta part of your culture, and you know, just find alcohol, maybe takes the edge off a bit and-"
"I-I know, I-I have friends who have drank during pregnancy, and-and, I see articles on Facebook and-. So, you know, I'm independent and I'll- I'll do whatever the fuck I want, it's my body."
"okay. ok. ok. So you're not comfortable with someone telling you what you should consume, what kind of alcohol, and how. And, um, it sounds like youve been getting some mixed messages, your doctor says there is no safe amount of alcohol you can. Also, you were checking- sounds like you were checking things out a bit too much."
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I looked it up to see, you know, kinda what I can say back, you know, to support my argument."
okay. ok. ok.
"Yeah, which is that, um, I'll do whatever I- do whatever I- do and what I know, right. So this- yeah. I dunno, but, um, I'm here anyway. So-"
So you know yourself best and you wanna be sorta the boss of your body and you dont want somebody else telling you what-. And it seems like you don't maybe worry about your substance use right now.
Nope. Not at all. Never been. Never will.
"okay. ok. ok. And I wonder if that concern comes from, ""It's been okay. I got these messages from friends"
Yep. Thats it. That
"""Um, media said it's okay to drink during alcoholics. So, here you go. And so that concern, um, just sort of, I'm not having it and, and maybe the doctor might be wrong"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. I'm thinking so.
You dont think he sort things up a bit there?
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you know-"
This might be extreme to-
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"-to quit drinking. Um, I just wanted to know, have you, um, would you be open maybe to just kind of taking a look at what Canada's guidelines say. Um, is that something you would open up to?"
Like right now?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Uh-
"What if- uh, can I show you a brochure about that?"
"Uh, yeah, I guess."
Yeah? Oh yeah?
Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure
"Well, if we take a look at the low-risk alcohol drinking guidelines, what it says is for women, um, the safe limits. And that's if a woman isnt already pregnant. And when it says in the guidelines, as far as drinking, uh, throughout pregnancy, there is no safe amount to drink. So really zero alcohol is, um, the woman shouldnt be drinking any at all. And I just wanna know-what are your thoughts on that?"
"Well, you know, I've-I've heard these types of things before, but I just- I don't see the proof. I'm not seeing the risk, you know, I don't, you know, if someone can like prove to me, or"
"So when you see this here in kinda black and white, you don't know if this is, uh, enough-"
Same thing. Same thing.
-to con-sort-convin-you-that-might-be-damn-it-that-alcohol-
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's just a fancy brochure saying what I already know, I already hear."
"So you feel like, um, what the doctor says and this brochure just kinda feels like, yeah, it's just kinda blowing things up out of proportion a"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"And it sounds like you-you have some solid information already that alcohol, you know, has been safe to-. Tell me about that information that you-youve-explored."
"Um, well, I looked up, um, different articles. Um, and I- as I said, I personally know people who have never had issues. Um, so that's about the extent."
"Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. You mentioned you looked up some articles and it sounds like evidence is really important to you. So, um, those articles, is that something recent. Um, you can say that"
"Like, uh, I'm not a fan of- have like a bibliography or anything."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"So I can't really- I'm not really sure when those were published. Its just stuff I found, supporting the way that I look at it."
"Um, the information that you find supports the values that you have of being able to be independent and autonomous, to be"
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  brochure says is that, um, the same again, the same thing that I heard, that the limits and that there"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Yall know this kinda kinda like the ""why"" that it kinda sounds like-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
-I'm never getting that information.
Wha-what if you drink and estrogen
"Yeah, like what kind of issues would that cause if any?"
"Maybe can kind of put that on the shelf for a moment, and we'll come back to it and sort, you know, what is-. Um, and I wonder if we can kinda just have a look for a moment at, um, your pregnancy, and is this something that"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
That was something you were planning?
Yep. Thats it. That
"okay. ok. ok. And I wonder as far as, um, bringing the baby into the world and, yall, your future as a parent, ho-how"
"Um, well, it's-it's really important to me. I have a huge priority of having a healthy baby and bringing him or her up well and, you know, be a good parent."
Mm. the mf. What does being a good parent look like. tell me more about that
"Um, not-so-excited about being there at home with them, not being absent, um, feeding them, um, changing their diaper. Um, kinda the- those basics."
Hmm. Interesting. Kinda like protecting your baby and-
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-guiding your baby and-
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"-you know, nurturing that baby is really important-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-and raising your child well?
"Yeah, of course."
"I really do hear you say that, you know, protecting your child is important to you and at the same time, um, some of the"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
What do you make of that- what do you think about that?
"Um, well, I just don't know- I just don't know where-these brochures get their information or-or anything from, like,"
Yall wanna see this in black and white
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Yall wanna know that this is the latest and greatest kind of thing. Uh, this is the latest information-based, um, on the latest research since 2011 and, um, a lot of. There's the-evidence that we do, um, but in the end, you choose what's best for you and your baby. What are your- what are your thoughts on that?"
"Um, well, it surprises me that's based on research from out of 2011, um, and I must have missed that. I guess, if it is, um, you know, I do wanna do what's best for my baby and for myself. And if I have to quit drinking, um, I guess ultimately I have to-I make that decision, um, but, um, that"
"Mm-hmm, kinda feels like, you know, you were making some really good decisions about your baby. Youve done research and you want to bring your child up well and take care of your child. And I-I can see that's really important to you. I hear you saying this and it kinda feels like this information isnt kind of what you were expecting to hear"
Nope. Not at all.
"What would you feel like would be helpful as far as next steps, like when you think about maybe moving away from drinking alcohol"
"first things first, if I could take a brochure home maybe, um, you know, show it to my partner and-and-get-. Um, I think that's probably the best thing I can do, like, today when I get home."
"Mm-hmm, that's some really significant steps you are taking. You mean putting the alcohol away, thats huge. Thats-that's some big steps."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"I know, exploring this with me today, and wondering if we can kind of continue this conversation again, and talk abou. Is this something you would open up to?"
"I think that would be a good idea, and maybe you could help me, yeah, with, like, ways to approach it because I. So-"
We can definitely cover that again on our next meeting. Thank you for coming to see me
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. You are welcome.
"Hi Andrea, thanks for coming in."
Hi. Nice to meet you. Thank you. You are welcome.
So idk how much yall know already about sorta my role here and why yall even here. So I thought I'd start by telling you a bit about myself.
okay. ok. ok.
"Basically, my job is to meet with all of the students. 2. 2. 2. 2. 2. 2. 2. 2. 2. 2. 2. 2. 2. 2. 2. 2. 2. 2. 2. 2. 2. 2. 2. 2. 2. 2. It aint my job to change on you. Cant even if I wanted to. Thats not my role at all. It really helps to think about, you know, how things are going for you and how you might like making changes or"
okay. ok. ok.
Is this okay?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. So why dont we start by you telling me a bit about yourself?
"Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure. Um, as you know, I'm Andrea, I, uh, I'm a junior I'm in the marching band. I'm playing the tenor sax."
"Oh, neat. Nice."
"Yeah, I'm in the-- I'm a bit of a band geek, too. [laughter] I'm playing, you know, in the wind ensemble and the jazz band, things like that."
Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. You're really involved in music.
"Yeah, [crosstalk]."
When did you start?
"Lol, actually I started playing about 10 years ago, actually."
Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow
"I started on violin first, then went on, explored a little with the piano, clarinet, finally found the tenor sax, and"
"Very cool. Very cool. Ive always wanted to be good at music. I think that's why. [laughter] Well, that's a good thing. So it sounds like youre in band and a few other musical ensembles, any other hobbies you have or things you like for fun?"
"Um, just hanging out with my friends or going to the beach, things like that."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Just kinda everyday stuff?
Yeah [laughs].
okay. ok. ok. tell me a bit about your family
"Uh, well I have one older brother he's about 8 and a half years older than me. My parents, and I have a dog [laughs]"
Cute. Cute. Cute. What kind of dog is this?
He's a Golden Retriever.
"Oh, nice. Nice. okay. ok. ok."
My big boy. My big boy. My
[Laughs] Very fun. Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. And how are things going in school for you?
They're pretty good. Grades have been pretty all the same. Still like 3.7 ish
"Well done, great, so youre doing well. What kinda goals do you have after college- oh, after high school?"
"Uh, I would, you know, I would, of course, graduate high school, hopefully, go to a nice Ivy League"
"Oh, all the same."
"But I mean, that might not happen. And then I would like to go on and become a doctor. Study psychology and then become a psychiatrist or something."
"Okay, you have some pretty big dreams."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
That's awesome. That's exciting to think about-
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"-and sort of be looking forward to the future and those things. Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. Well, one thing I'll ask you about is, um, you know, different people have sorta. Whether its, you know, their cultural identity or their family or their friends or job or hobbies, things like that. So here's the little sheet that goes through just some basic values that, um, might be more or less"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Like belonging or sense of community. Again, cultural identity or family, friendship, modesty, religion, respect, self-determination and spirituality. So, which of these is kind of most important to you in terms of your life right now?"
"Um, I think a sense of community and belonging."
okay. ok. ok.
"Those two and, um, respect."
"Respect, okay. Can you please tell me a bit about why you picked those 3?"
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I think community and belonging, I kinda relate them. Um, you know how I said I was in the marching band?"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"I really, you know, I really enjoy being in that team setting of, you know, being with other people and all working towards"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"And then in terms of respect, I-I kinda view that as one of like my major like rules. I really do think respect is important, to respect myself and to respect those around me, so."
okay. ok. ok.
I'm placing great importance in that.
"Oh, cool. Great. So sort of being a part of a group and being a part of a team gives you a sense of, um, belonging"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
And sort of a-a sense of purpose in a way.
Yes. Purpose.
And then the respect is really all-encompassing.
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes
"Not just authority, but respecting yourself, respecting your teammates or your bandmates and other p. Well, that's awesome."
"Definitely, thats right."
"Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. Well, um, one of the things I wanted to talk to you about sort of relate to belong. So what kinda things do you like to do when you get your friends together?"
"Um sometimes we just, you know, go to movies, go to the beach, like I said, or sometimes we just get together at someones house."
"Mm-hmm, and when you hang out with friends, is there ever alcohol involved?"
"Yeah, sometimes."
okay. ok. ok. Can you say a bit about how alcohol fits into sort of your social scene?
"Uh, well, its mostly just for, for, parties or party settings is kinda to get things going and get"
"Mm-hmm mm-hmm. And so when you go to parties, most of the time there's alcohol there?"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
okay. ok. ok. And how often do you think you would say you drink?
"I would have said, um, on a not busy month, for instance, I would have said about like 2 weekends out of the month. 2 or 3."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. So about half the time you drink and half the time you dont. Can you tell me what makes you choose to drink versus not drink?
"The days that we drink are mostly, like I said, they're parties, so it's more of that whole partying and, y. And then when we dont, its a lot more laid back. Its a lot more hanging out, playing board games, watching movies it aint yeah"
"So it really depends on what the activity is, whether or not alcohol is in it?"
Definitely. Definitely.
okay. ok. ok. And do you notice a huge difference or can you tell me about your enjoyment level at say a party vs a night you play board
"Um, I think of them as-as different, I think, you know, like in playing board games and things, it's meant to be relaxing"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
So this is nice to have like
Uh-huh. Uhhhh.
"-versus with a party it's a lot more energetic it's, uh, after it all, very draining."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
But in the moment its quite fun to dance and have fun.
okay. ok. ok. So there's sort of pros and cons on both sides?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
okay. ok. ok. What are your favorite things about drinking or like drinking?
"Um, it's, you know, when we drink, we-we tend to have more fun because I guess we're not, you know, everyone. We are a lot more relaxed and relaxed-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"-and not really thinking about stressing or things like that, but it can be--when its too much drinking, can be-"
"okay. ok. ok. So sortin' in the-too-drinking or-or at times, can you tell me some of the less good things or not so"
"Um, a lot of times, it will make- it will make people stupid. [Laughs] Yeah, people make dumb decisions and things like that. We-we usually try to be as safe as possible"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"- as possible. So we can like sleep over at a friend's house. And so that, you know, we don't drive and it mostly happens within our friend group. So we don't worry about stranger things putting weird things in our drinks."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"But, um, definitely some of the ideas people can have when they stup- when theyre drunk and can be real"
"Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. So you are trying to, like you said, not engage in really dangerous activities?"
Yeah
"You tryna stay put, you aint driving. You tryna stay with people that you trust. Um but yet it sounds like some-some things are still happening from time to time."
Sometimes. Sometimes. Always. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Can you say a bit more about that?
"Well, especially don't like it whenever me or one of my friends, like we drink too much and end up like throwing up or"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Throwing up is never fun.
It's not.
And how often do you think that happens?
"I think that happened once for me. I was the first time I ever drank and it was- it was a lot, I didn't know what I was doing. Ive been mixing all types of weird stuff and just kind of taking anything anyone- anyone- gave me"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
-and that didnt end well.
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"But after that, I still havent- but I do have friends that still do sometimes so I'll end up like having to take care of"
okay. ok. ok.
This kinda puts a downer on my- on my fun.
"Uh-huh. Uhhhh. okay. ok. ok. People are just more relaxed, sorta, carefree can kinda let loose a bit more, on-the-other-hand, the"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"-Because you need to make sure that you do it safely or as safely as you can. Um some other consequences like throwing up or even if its not you, that sometimes youre stuck your- fun is sorta ruined when you. okay. ok. ok. And the other not so good things about alcohol?"
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. People can get sloppy like sloppy, I guess. Like they all loose, like with people doing things that should be done in private-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
-and that kinda stuff.
So you kinda stuck being exposed to things you dont need to see.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Got it. Got it. Got it. okay. ok. ok. Um, all the same. Well, you mentioned a few times that you made a few decisions to try and limit the dangerous aspect of the. Why did you make those decisions?"
"Just- I'm, you know, I have an aunt who is an alcoholic. So I-I see like the issues that are involved and I see movies and things I know that drunk driving"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"I know, I wanna be as safe as possible in those terms and be in a setting where like we can let loose but still be. But-- So, I- like I know that there are dangers involved and I guess I wanna limit that."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
And so be where I am.
"okay. ok. ok. Yeah, sounds kinda similar to your, um, value of respect to yourself."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"On the one hand, you- the drinking maybe helps with the belonging community to start."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
If there's too much then it sort of constitutes
So it kinda defeats the purpose. [Laughs]
"Right. Right. Right. And then with the respect, one of the things you mentioned, is really wanting to respect yourself and not sort"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Um, how do you think that drinking fits in with that?"
In terms of what. In terms of respect? In terms of respect?
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"I think, well in a way, drinking is probably a form of disrespect to my own body because I put things- I put things in"
okay. ok. ok.
"- how tf is it that I respect myself, I respect myself by like trying to stay in someone's house and like trying to limit my drinking"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"And tryna, yall know, let loose but still control my behavior so I aint going places with a person I met-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"- into I dont know where to, I dont know what, and-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
- things like that.
okay. ok. ok. So you sorta want that balance-
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-of how much you can drink to have some of the positive benefits but not cross over.
okay. ok. ok. And what did you come up with at this point. Do you have sorta-a-a limit that you stick to or are you--?
"I usually-- Well, I start off like I make sure that I make my own drink so I know what's in it and how. So in that way I control how much I drink. So, I usually just, you know, get one of those cups and then make one drink. And then I'll try to make it last as long as possible. And I be like, ""Okay this one drink me"" and be good in that way. Im still got something in my cup so people aint be like, ""Oh, here. I got you. Have some more."". I would have been like, ""No, I'm good. I'm good. I'm still got mine,"" and I'll still be, you know, having some to like let loose a little"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. okay. ok. ok. And do you feel that works pretty well for you or do you sometimes exceed that limit or-or what do you think?
"I'll be like, ""No, I'm good. I'll be fine. I'll be okay. I'll be okay. I'll be okay. For the most part,. I'm still- You know, I'm still-. Ill get some later."". And never ending up getting nothing. Lol but sometimes they'll be like, ""Hey, let's take a shot,"" and everyone gathered around like the kitchen or something. And then at that point, I'll be like, ""Oh, well, maybe I can take one more."". And this is when I start, falling into-"
okay. ok. ok.
-way too much.
"So, uh, a portion of the time it works well for you and another portion of the time maybe you would-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-wish some changes-
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"-to- make it a little bit more smooth. okay. ok. ok. So, kind of thinking along those lines, how important is it to you make some changes or make some changes to your drinking to sort"
"Um, I wouldnt mind making sure that I would, you know, in terms of respecting myself and my body,"
okay. ok. ok.
"Like I-I-- You know, its nice to let loose and have fun, but I also want it to be so, you know, I"
Right. Right. Right.
I be like 22 and my liver still not working
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"And, um, have my friends on board with a similar mentality so we can kind of work at it together as a- as a"
Uh-huh. Uhhhh. So kind ofCombining yalls-
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"-goals. okay. ok. ok. So, you- you have a goal it sounds like, of actually cutting back on your drinking. How important is it to work on that goal and on a scale of one to ten, where one is not at all?"
I would say about like-like 6 or 7
"Oh, okay. That's okay."
"I wouldnt mind working on it but, yall know, if I get around to it, I get around to it. If I dont, I dont."
Uh-huh. Uhhhh. Why are you saying 6 or 7 rather than like a 4?
"Um, because I still think this-it-is-important."
Uh-huh. Uhhhh.
"I'm still, you know. Like I said, I'm not about to hurt my body. Especially going to med school like I know how things affect your body and also your- your- social and your-. Once I get to college its not- it aint gonna-gonna-work-out being, yall know, drinking every weekend and then like trying to wake up early. Like I know that's not- that's not viable. This is not a good idea."
"Yea, looking ahead, you can't keep drinking this way and reaching the goals that you have for yourself."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"okay. ok. ok. Well, how confident are you that you could cut down if you wanted to-"
I'm thinking I-
-on that same scale from one to ten?
"I think if I made the decision that I was going to, for sure, then I think definitely like a 10 I know it would"
Oh wow. Wow. okay. ok. ok. Why are you saying 10?
"I know that once I make the decision, I know I can make it. This is making the decision in the first place."
"okay. ok. ok. And so you mentioned the- quite a few reasons why you'd want to cut down on the. Um, have you thought at all about how you might go about doing that?"
"Um, I think I might be trying to convince my friends without sounding, yall know, dorky or something and be. Like, let's not go out or something. Or just be like, hey, I'm not like-- I don't drink today. And then even if my friends do, like being okay with them, drinking around me and not doing it-- Me not drinking and them"
"So sort of, um, trying to plan more activities that don't involve alcohol-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-and also trying to participate in activities without drinking yourself or maybe even drinking less than you
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
okay. ok. ok. Does this sound like a goal you want to work on now or?
I'm thinking so. I'm thinking that's-it very feasible. I'm thinking that could be possible.
"okay. ok. ok. Um, so, I guess, less alcohol activities. I just made some notes to myself and then maybe, um, reduced the amount of drinking that you do if alcohol. okay. ok. ok. Um, so that-that goal sounds feasible, you said. Would it be okay if we met in a few weeks to sort out how this works?"
I'm thinking so. That sounds good to me.
Is this something you would like to do?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"okay. ok. ok. I appreciate spending the time talking to me, you know, it sounds like you have a lot of really good goals for yourself, really ambitious goals of. Um, you really look forward to doing well in school so you can get there"
"pretty active social life and a-a lot of friends that you feel like youd be, uh, supportive, even if you cut down on alcohol"
I would be very excited to be able to talk to you about how you have a good plan in place and as long as you
"Yeah, I would."
Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. Awesome. Great. So I'll-I'll be planning to see you then in a few more weeks
Perfect. Perfect. Nice. Nice. Nice.
Awesome. Great.
"Good morning nice to meet you again. And, uh, and what seems to be the-problem or what-what-led you to come along?"
"Uh, just I hate drinking. I drink way too much. Um, I just thought, uh, maybe I need someone to talk to, get some help about this."
"Okay, so you're feeling as if drinking is a problem for you at this moment?"
"Yeah, it just- it just got worse over the last 6 months?"
okay. ok. ok. Wh-Wh-What makes you say that it's gotten worse?
"drank, you know, like most people do before, um, but I broke up with my bf, uh, about a year ago and then 6 months"
okay. ok. ok.
"And I was, yeah, getting into this habit of going out every Friday and Saturday, now, drinking a lot"
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes
"Um, to try and meet guys."
Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure
"And, uh, in the past few months Ive been, yall, just drinking even more on week nights, and never even use"
"Okay, okay, so you noticed over, I guess, the past 6 months in particular since you decided, you know what. I'm going to take a risk and-a-and go out to try to meet a-a pot-potential partner again that it's with"
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm just, I'm not comfortable talking to guys normally. [chuckles]"
okay. ok. ok.
"Um, and I just, drinking helps. I'm not sure what to say."
"Sure, sure. So you notice that drinking at the moment is a way of perhaps calming the nerves?"
Yeah for sure.
To-to-to speak to-to potential partners?
Definitely. Definitely.
"Who-who-who, boys?"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
okay. ok. ok.
"I mean, I guess, like most people do when they go outside they drink."
okay. ok. ok.
Ive been doing this and just drinking more and more I guess
Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure
"Um, and it just-- it just-- it just doesnt work, I really meet people and just end up with massive hangover for the rest"
"That's interesting isn't it. You--'cause you kinda mentioned it there, like, you know, on one side of the coin, um, helps calm the nerves to get"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"-talk to guys at once, on another note it's not working you find that out. And i-i-it results in hangovers or?"
"I may have talked to people but it's just, uh, that I think I'm just too-drunk and just drives me home"
"Okay, and so I guess, what would you like to do given the circumstances?"
guess im just gonna stop. Just feel like I'm drinking more and more 'cause I'm doing this shit now in the weekdays-
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"-and I mean, I just don't-- I just don't wanna do that every now and then I just think it's a bit too much"
okay. ok. ok.
"Yeah, I just cant eat properly anymore, I just eat less or just get takeaway, getting crap food and-"
okay. ok. ok.
"-um, I just, I feel like I don't exercise like I used to. So, I'm just gonna cut, yall know, stop drinking so much"
"Okay, okay, so, uh, sounds like you really want to stop drinking, particularly during the weekdays?"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah I'm doing that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Right because you notice it has negative affects on what you eat.
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm not gonna- I'm not gonna, I mean, I don't wanna stop altogether, so."
"Nah I get that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it sounds like it does, it helps a degree for you when you go outside because it makes you feel a bit more calm to talk to-guys"
Yeah and just and all my friends go out and drink. Like I-
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"-If I didnt have social life, I wouldnt have been able to do this"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"If I just said- said, ""No, I'm not drinking at all,"" and, you know, I don't feel like I'm an alcoholic-"
Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure
-or I dont feel like I need to
"Yeah, yeah. So, you got, you know, some benefits there then, you know. The social element, hanging with friends and-going out together is something which is-is quite enjoyable. So, it's not a case of removing it completely but it’s a case of, ""Okay, I’m noticing this impact on me more than what. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, okay."
"Yeah, just got a bit out of control."
Has there been times in the past where you’ tried to cut back on drinking?
Nah this has’t happened before
Lol this is the first time anything like this has come up?
"Um, due to just circumstances of, I mean, I just yeah, had my bf for 6 years before that and-"
"Yes, yes. Yes, yes."
"Um, before that yeah just my friends weren't drinking so much, and yeah it’s just not, it's new. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah."
"Oh, yeah. Okay. ’s great that you can identify, you know, what’s going on at the moment and you--"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"-as to why you’re-you're-drinking. On a scale of 0 to 100 and 100, uh, meaning it’s tremendously important for you and 0 not important at all. How important is it to cut back on drinking?"
"I believe 80, I mean I guess that’s why I’m here so ’m"
"Okay, yeah sure, you are taking a huge step forward in many ways by coming along to-to start talking ab"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Um, I suppose 80 is quite high, what makes you say an 80 over say 50?"
"’t know, it just sort-a-sort-out, it just sort-a-sort-out, like no-nobody else is really"
okay. ok. ok.
"-it seemed, as just, yeah, for the reasons I was saying, just seeing like I need to do something about it now"
"Okay, yes, so you’ve got this real sense of, ""I need to do something."""
"Just seeing this’s just gonna get worse, uh, wha-- that’s what it seems like."
Thats what it seems like.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"this is a case of the past 6 months, this is a pattern that you’ been noticing more and more, um, a. I wanna do something about this"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Okay, I mean what are you thinking next step?"
"Um, I guess that’s why I’m here. [chuckles]"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Just to, uh, but um-- I is-is-- I think the weekdays are what I really need to do."
okay. ok. ok.
"Um, and then, I don’t know, tryna plan it out a bit more on weekends-"
okay. ok. ok.
-so it just goes crazy.
"Okay, okay, so you’re thinking maybe looking at trying to keep weekdays free of alcohol. Was that what you were saying?"
"Yeah, yeah. Yep. Thats it. That"
Ok how is that a first step goal for you?
"Nah that’s good, that’s-that's, yeah, that's-that's definitely what I’m gonna do."
okay. ok. ok.
"Im just, yall, so out of the routine, not exercise, I need to get back into things."
"Okay, you sound mad about it to-turn it around."
"Yeah but I mean, I guess, just talking about it makes me think oh yeah, I need to- I need to-"
"Oh, that-that's excellent, oh."
"So, Jacob, everything looks normal on your physical exam. Any questions for me?"
No. No no no no no
"okay. ok. ok. I see that you filled out our, um, alcohol and drug questionnaire. Is it okay if we go through this together?"
Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure
okay. ok. ok. What we are talking about is confidential. If you give me permission or if I become concerned about a danger to- you or to-. Does this make sense?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"okay. ok. ok. So, here we have it. So I see that you marked that you sometimes use alcohol to relax, feel better about yourself or fit in. Mind telling me a bit more about your alcohol use?"
"No offense. Not a big deal. Sometimes with my friends we drink a few beers and when we hang out or when we have a party, and rum and cokes"
"Okay, how many do you usually have at a time?"
"Um, 3 or 4, probably. I'm not keeping track."
okay. ok. ok. And how often?
"Um, probably once or twice a month."
"okay. ok. ok. So, you're drinking with friends, sort of 3 or 4 beers or mixed drinks, one or two times a month. How long did you do that?"
Probably since last October.
"So, for about 6 months. I'm curious. What do you like about drinking alcohol?"
What do I like about this?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Um, I'm not sure. Drinking with my friends is just fun, like when we hang out at a party at someone elses house, and we. That tastes good."
"okay. ok. ok. So, sounds like you feel relaxed and have fun when drinking with friends and you like the flavor"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"okay. ok. ok. I am also curious, are there any parts about your alcohol use that you don't like?"
"Um, I'm not a fan of getting sick in the mornings 'cause of hangovers and-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"-when I start throwing up, that's not- I don't like that."
"Have you ever experience a-a blackout, like when you drink and wake up and can't remember what happened?"
"Nah but that happened to someone I know, though"
"okay. ok. ok. And have you had any problems related to-to your drinking alcohol, like at home or school or somewhere else?"
"Um, one time I missed first period of school 'cause I had a hangover and was late getting up"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Mm, mom got mad at me 'cause I wouldn't get out of bed and she said she knows I have a hangover"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. Have you told your mother that you drink with your friends?
Nah but I got grounded for 2 weeks after that. [chuckles]
"So more negative things about your drinking, like getting into trouble with your mom and missing a class at school?"
Yeah but I only missed school once
okay. ok. ok. I see on your questionnaire that you havent ridden in a car with someone who has been drinking and you hav. Is this correct?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"That's awesome. And I hope you continue to avoid those things. I want you to know that I am concerned about your drinking as your doctor. When teens drink, things can go wrong, like damaging yourself. Even when youre not drinking too excess, though, your brain is still developing and is very sensitive to the effects of"
okay. ok. ok.
"This is why I recommend that all my adolescent patients not drink at all. So if you were to think today about how ready you feel to stop drinking alcohol on a scale of zero to ten, with zero"
"Um, probably a 5."
"A five? A five? A five. So, I'm curious. Why didnt you pick a lower number like a 2 or 3 that would mean youre only a fraction of the way to stop drinking?"
"Well, I guess I just tired of getting in trouble"
okay. ok. ok. What could you do to avoid getting in trouble?
"Um, not drinking."
[chuckles] Have you tried not drinking or stopping drinking?
"Nah, not really."
okay. ok. ok. What some people your age do is try to stop drinking for a period of time just to see what that feels like.
I could probably do that
"So, how long could you go without drinking?"
I'm not sure.
Think you could go 2 months without drinking?
"Yeah, probably."
okay. ok. ok. What things would make it easier to not drink?
"Um, I could probably drink something else when my friends are drinking, like just coke."
Anything else to make things easier for you?
I can probably hang out with some of my friends who dont drink or invite them to parties and have fun '
"okay. ok. ok. Is there anyone in your life that you can talk to about this, who gives you some support for not drinking?"
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The-- My friends who dont drink would probably be happy that I dont drink either and yes, they would support me"
"Awesome. Great. So yall came up with some reasons to stop drinking, like having hangovers and throwing up and getting into trouble. And you developed some strategies to-try to not drink, like spending more time with friends who dont drink or have. That's a great plan I think. I'm really proud of you for giving this a try. How about if I make an appointment for 2 months from now and then I see you back and we can see how things"
okay. ok. ok.
"So, Rick, just in regards to your flatmate situation at the moment with Tristan. Uh, we talked about how walking through this program and having some positive influence to help you through this. If you stay living with Tristan, I just want to rethink a bit. What are the pros and cons of that. What are the good things about living there, what are the not-so-good things about living there?"
"Oh, that's a comfy place. Close to work. Living with a mate is good"
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, in terms of being supportive and a sort of support you need to make these changes."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
What is your thinking around that?
"That's the thing, isn't it. I am-- I'm not sure if it's the best place for me to be if I'm gonna make those changes."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
And Tristan is a good flatmate
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"I'm no-- We're going in different-different directions now. He's not the same kind of person I have and stuff, and so-- And I can't expect him to change his whole life around, just because"
Right. Right. Right.
"Just-- I'm not sure how keen I am to move in with my- with my aunty and uncle, though."
"okay. ok. ok. You are good to explore but I just want to ask you about, how much does Chris-Christian-Christian know-- Tristan know. What does he really know about the changes you wanna make?"
"I'm sitting on it and talking to him, asked for, um, for support and stuff and he's fully, he says. But, like I said, he is, um, in a different place in his life than I am in mine."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
He's not having kids.
Right. Right. Right.
"He's not-- I don't know if he can really understand what that means to me. Um, he's a good mate."
"okay. ok. ok. Whāna, moving in with whāna, moving in with your auntie and uncle? What are some pros and cons?"
"Food would be good. Um, I get- I get- support with- my whānau is really supportive, but I'm- I'm worried about losing-. I'm worried about, um, about them taking over, or, you know what I mean. I'm in a freedom where I'm in charge of myself, I'm in a freedom where I'm. That would probably be really good"
"Freedom and charge of yourself, and the changes that we speak of, and build your own family, and to enable you re. Is it something you hang on to, or how you manage that?"
"If it means that I lose custody of my kids, I dont wanna hang on to freedom. Um, I just, uh, I just, uh, worry about-- I just, uh, worry about, that I'll, even if family, that"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
I'm not sure. Anything I do to get my kids back I will
"Hi Sarah, it was great meeting you. My name is Delwyn, and I'm a counselor here at the clinic. And I heard from your nurse practitioner that you recently had an annual exam on which the topic of smoking and alcohol. Would you mind filling me in on that?"
"Oh yeah, um, I met my nurse practitioner last week, and I ge-I guess she's worried about how much I'm smoking and drinking right now. I mean, I-I've been agreeing I'd work on the smoking and try to cut back on that. But, as far as the drinking, I-I really dont think I drink that much"
"So, you decide to cut back on your smoking a bit, but, you don't really care about your drinking."
"Right, I mean, I'm not drinking that much and, honestly, it-it-just-makes-it-feel-so-good-"
This is a nice form of stress relief.
"Exactly, exactly. kinda like that me time at the end of the day"
sort of escape from your hectic schedule.
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I have a 2 year old son, and then, I work full time. Also, Ive started back going back to school. So, just trying to juggle all that stuff. I know its tiring, and so, you know, at the end of the day, I just- I wanna relax and enjoy myself."
"So, you work and then, on top of that, juggling being a single mom and going to school?"
"Yeah, and for work, yall know I'm a server. So, I'm on my feet all day, yall know, and it's-it's really tiring."
Work is pretty exhausting
"Yea, its hard trying to please customers all day. And then, at the same time, I-I'm-I'm-worry, am I making enough money to support my son, you know?"
"So, yall are doing really tiring work and going to school but yall also worry about your finances"
"Yeah, and then, with going back to school, you know, I gotta figure out how I can pay for everything. So, you know, i-it's just a lot right now."
"Yeah, it does. It sounds like a lot that you are trying to sort out, and it makes sense that you feel that you need some kind of break or"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"So, tell me a bit more about your drinking. Tell me a bit about how much you drink, and, um, the pattern, and what raised concern."
"Well, that's the thing. I-I'm not really understanding what raised concern. I mean, I'm not that drunk, you know. I-I went up to maybe 2 drinks a day max, yall know that"
"So, you drink, perhaps, 2 drinks a day. Um, and I wonder, what have you heard about drinking levels recommendations?"
Not much. Not much.
"Ok, will you be interested in hearing about those recommendations?"
Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure
"okay. ok. ok. Well, so, the recommendation for women is to have no more than 3 drinks a day, and no more than 7 drinks over the course of a week. Yeah, um, and, really, the reason for those recommendations is to just reduce the risk that people have trouble with accidents, or. Like certain types of cancers, or high blood pressure, and then also psychological issues. I'm not sure what you think about all that?"
"i-idk, i-its just surprising me because, i mean, two drinks a day, that-that doesnt seem like a problem or risky, you. And, I have family members who drink a lot more than that per day, and, it's not a problem for them. So, i-this just surprises me."
"I just dont see it as abnormal to you, especially when you compare it with your family."
"No. No no no no no. And then, I dont know, I just get annoyed, honestly, because, you know, I did agree I would try to work on my smoking. But, with this whole drinking thing, it's like everything that I enjoy, you know, is being taken away from me right now. And so, if I give up drinking, like, what am I going to have to enjoy myself, you know."
"Yea, you really feel like you need that reward"
"Yeah, yeah."
"Also, it sounds like, um, your drinking may have risen a bit over time, too?"
"Yeah, I mean, I guess that has happened. Probably just with being so stressed out every day, you know. So, I'm in my second semester of school right now, and so, adding that to everything, uh, it's a lot. And, yall, Im trying to figure out child carry. Um, normally, my mom will watch my son but, lately, she can't always. And so, I always feel like, will she be able to, you know,. So, i-its just stressful."
"Yeah and so it sounds like you noticed that the more stressed you get, the more you drink."
"Yeah, I-I guess that's right."
"So, let me summarise a bit what you told me. Sounds like you have a pretty hectic, stressful life, and you really feel that you need some kind of-"
Uh-huh. Uhhhh.
"-reward or stress relief. Um, and then, on another note, you noticed, um, that your drinking has risen a bit over time. Also, the more stressed you are fe- you feel, the more you are inclined to drink."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"So, I'm wondering, have you noticed any issues from drinking?"
"No. No no no no no. the one thing that comes to mind is, I mean, theres going to be evenings when I just kind of want my son to bed a bit earlier. Um, I do feel guilty about that sometimes, because, I should enjoy spending time with my son, but, instead, you know. Sophalous"
"So, you notice that it starts calling you out in the evenings."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
And it may have taken you away from things that are more important to you?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
And it's not feeling good?
No. No no no no no
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And so, it sounds like there's a bit of a dilemma there, because-- And I guess we should be clear, it's not the occasional drink. Um, it's-it's really the quantity of drinking, and-and whether your drinking is escalating and interfering with things that"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
And you may have never seen it in that light before.
"No. No no no no no. And, i-it's just, it's really hard to take in right now. Yeah, I mean, yeah. I-I never thought this would happen to me like this. And, so, I-I'm kinda worried about you."
I-it seems like it-it would be quite a hard pattern to change.
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Part of my routine right now, and, you know, I-I'm not willing to sacrifice something I enjoy, but, you know,. I-Im trying to, you know, go-back-to-school-. Im trying to work. So, I'm not sure how I can do all of this if I can't enjoy myself or relax, you know?"
"So, it seems like it would be really difficult to change because it's something that's really relevant to you right now."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"But on another note, it does sound like there are things that you- that you value that you don't want the drinking to"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"So, I guess I'm wondering if you've given any thought to other ways in which you could cope with stress without rely"
"I think I could feel myself relaxing, and, maybe, not feeling like I need to unwind in the same way."
"So, if you could somehow tackle some of these stressful issues, um, that could make a difference, and, what-"
"Um, you know, probably my biggest problem is just childcare. My mom usually watches my son but she's been kind of backing out lately so you know. And so, I worry, am I going to have to call into work today, am-am I going to miss class. So, you know, worrying about that really stresses me out, you know."
"So, having more reliable childcare could make a huge difference."
Definitely. Definitely.
"And it sounds like your mom has been an option in the past, but perhaps not so much anymore."
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean she's watching him so much. I think shes just probably getting stressed out. And, i feel bad because, you know, it's not her son, so i-it shouldn't be her problem, but, I need something that i"
"So, one thing that could make a huge difference is if you could figure out some sort of more reliable, affordable childcare, and"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Anything else?
"Well, most of my problems are always going back to money. i-if i had more money, i could afford daycare, i could work less hours, you know. So, yeah. It's-it's normally related to money."
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It-it sounds like, um, you know, money could make a huge difference, and you are working full time and trying to. Um, but on another note, yall know that sounds like yall have some other ideas of coping- of how you might cope. Um, so, I guess, I'm- I'm wondering, given our conversation so far, kind of where you are with"
"Um, we started off discussing how your drinking has sort of drifting into a risky area, and it would be advised. Um but sounds like you feel that's fairly important to you and not something you necessarily want to. But on another note, we talked about ways in which that perhaps could be made a bit easier, but I don't think you are ready to tackle that. I just kinda wanna know where you are"
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I'm ready to consider changing my drinking, but, as far as actually doing it, I-. Im so busy that I mean I have a lot of issues that Im trying to work out right now"
"So, um, it might be helpful if you could narrow it down to just one thing, and what would that be?"
"Childcare, probably."
"okay. ok. ok. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's why I'm so sure that's why I'm so sure that keeps coming up as one of the main. Um, so there may be some resources I can point you towards, but I'm- guess I'm wondering, have you looked into alternative, more"
"Not really. Not at all. I mean, I'm just normally seeing if my mom can watch my son so, you know, I haven't really looked around"
"okay. ok. ok. I mean, one of our social workers, they sort of specialize in helping people who have a lot on their plate identifying resources that. So, idk, would you be interested in doing something like this?"
Definitely. Definitely.
"okay. ok. ok. Awesome. Great. Oh, so, I can definitely set you up with that, and you can-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"-um, try to tackle, um, your childcare issues, um, with some assistance. Is there anything else you guys would like to do, um, for example, would you be interested in talking to me again, um, just as things"
"Yeah, I-I think I would. I mean, it's-it's been nice to just talk about everything that's going on."
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, these are not problems that will go away in a week. Resolving is taking some time. Oh, cool. Great. So, um, it sounds like we have a few things to pursue, uh, to pursue."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
Anything-anything else?
Mm-mm
Would you consider setting goals with respect to your drinking?
"Well, I mean, I could at least try going back to one drink a night instead of two."
okay. ok. ok. Try cutting back a bit and see how that works.
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I-I don't know how this works, especially with trying to cut back on smoking already, but,"
"okay. ok. ok. I think doing managing, you might just learn a bit about how easy or hard it is to cope with stress in other ways."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"okay. ok. ok. So, it sounds like we have two avenues to pursue, anything else?"
I'm not okay. I'm not okay.
"okay. ok. ok. Well, that sounds good. So, why is it that we don't meet again in a few weeks and you kinda update me on how cutting back on your drinking. Sound good? Sound good? Sound good"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Oh, cool. Great. Looking forward to talking next time"
okay. ok. ok. Thanks. For the follow!
"steve, before we go on our tour today, i was wondering if you would be willing to take a few minutes to talk abou"
Okay like what?
"Well, you filled out this survey for us today, which was awesome. Thank you so much. Just wanted to review a few things on here. I noticed that you said that you drink 2-3 times a week, drink 3 or 4 drinks at a time when you do, and weekly, um,. So 6 or more drinks, it says on here"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
Is this realistic?
"Yeah, uh, on weekends?"
"okay. ok. ok. ok. Just wanted to let you know, I'm a bit concerned about your level of drinking. Overly drinking to make problems worse or can actually cause health issues at times, and I was just wondering if you thought about the"
"Nah, I guess I havent really thought much of that. Um, I'm not really sure I drink that much in the first place-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
-so this is why i have a hard time believing that this is causing my anxiety.
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Actually, on nights when I dont drink, I-I have a harder time going to sleep."
"A lot of people think that drinking helps them sleep better, and in reality, drinking might make you wake up faster, but this rebound effect"
"Well, I, yeah, I'm a bit of a morning person, I'm probably awake on nights I drink too much."
"Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. Oh, just wanted to just show you this little chart here. You drink more than those at a low risk level for your age as a male. Um, the low risk of men under 65 drinking less than 14 drinks a week and not having 4 a day. And, in this case, a drink is considered 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or an ounce and a half of distilled. And you are right, you dont drink as much as some people out there. The way you responded to our questions here, you are actually falling in the high risk category, the risky or Hazardous category, category 2"
Jeez no. Never thought I was this bad
"This is why it's helpful to look at this and give some perspective. On a scale of 1-10, what is your readiness to change, 1 being I dont want to change at all, and 10 being I really want to change?"
"I'm not sure. This is all news to me. Ive, never wanted to do anything to put myself at risk and Ive always thought of myself as a pretty healthy person. guess i put myself right in the middle of the 5"
"Well, that's awesome. Thats halfway there. What kept you from just giving it a one or two, something lower?"
"I'm training for the marathon, and this is why I'm coming in, but I also don't think of myself as a smoker, and. So, this is-that why middle ground, five."
"Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. okay. ok. ok. Well, that's a good place to start. So, I heard you said your health is important, and you're getting ready to run a marathon, so. Also, you fell in this risky or hazardous category, and you also fell in"
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes
"okay. ok. ok. So, based on all that information, what are you willing to think about doing to change right now?"
"Well, I-I think the natural thing would be to cut back a bit on my drinking."
"Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. So, what would that look like for you?"
"I-I guess drinking no more than maybe 3 or 4 beers a week, and-and on the weekends, which is when I would drink the most, cup back to no more than 5"
"okay. ok. ok. ok. Sometimes when people are not ready to make changes like this, it helps if they write down their goals, it. If you were to look at this lil form here and figure out where you want to be with your drinking, what would you put down?"
"Um, doing the math, I guess no more than 18 drinks a week"
"okay. ok. ok. So that's an improvement. So you headed in the right direction. 18 drinks a week, you still fall below this low risk category, and that would be my recommendation that you would fall below into this 14 or less. But it's an improvement, and it's a great place to start, and I really commend you for your willingness to"
Thanks. For the follow!
So I hope that in your appointment next month we can touch base on this and see how it
Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure
okay. ok. ok. Good. Good. Good. Good
"Minnesota State Mankato security report states that you were stopped on stadium road last Friday, citing for driving under the influence and you. Plus the report lists your age as 20. Dylan, what accuracy is this. And can you share with me some details leading up to this incident?"
"Uh, I guess that sounds right. I mean, I was- I was kinda drunk and this happened like a week ago. Just drove over to my friend's house, um, just to go watch the game and, you know, we're having a few beers and next. So weve been drinking a bit more than usual. And at the end I had to get home and couldnt find a ride. So I-I just drove."
"Youve decided to drink more than you intended because you were disappointed at how the Vikings were playing. And when your roommate couldnt give you a ride home, you decided to drive yourself home. Did I get that right?"
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Thats-that's exactly how it happened. I mean, I'm a normal college kid. Drinking and hanging out with my homies is my favorite thing to do. I mean, I, it wasnt a big house party or anything and got me busted."
"Yeah, I understand that your intention was to have fun while watching the game with your friends. When you were drinking alcohol underage because you were at your boyfriends house and not a big party and you made an effort to be safe"
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Trying to be safe. I mean, I was trying to call her roommate but I dont know, getting in trouble anyways"
"Dylan, you told me what brought you to this world today, what do you think the problem really is?"
"Um, well, I'll just say I have a drinking problem. I think I'd probably have more of a, like getting caught problem. My friends, they-drinking like fishes and I-never get caught and you get me over here and they leave"
"Sounds like you attribute your current situation to bad luck. If this is what you believe and you don't try to change your behavior, what consequences might be?"
I guess- I guess more problems with police and school and I really dont have like the time or the money for any
"How important is avoiding future problems with the police or school, Dylan?"
"Dear God. This, I suppose, is, super important, because just-going-to-detox-alone-was-awesome, the experience--. And my dad said if I get suspended from school, um, I gotta go- I gotta go work on my uncle's farm in Iowa and that. I wont see any of my friends and I mean, its already bad enough, like my parents took my car away when I got the DUI"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What would you be willing to do to avoid going to detox again and getting suspended?
"Well, I guess I- I guess the easy one is I wouldn't- I wouldn't drink so much and I'm trying to avoid situations where. So probably not gonna drink so much"
"On a scale of 1 to 10, how confident are you that youll make it through with that plan with 10 being very confident?"
"Um, I guess I'd say like, I dunno, like over half of the way. So maybe like 6"
What steps could you take to get that 6 to a 7 or 8?
"I could probably, um, I dunno. big thing would be like kinda where I drink so like drinking like if I only go out to my apartment so I'm not risking myself to. Um, maybe find stuff to do that doesnt revolve around drinking, like, I guess like a town this size"
In what ways might your life be better if you succeed in hooting the changes you mentioned?
"I guess the big one would be like I wont- I wont be hungover all day like I would make it to my 8:00 AMs. And then I get to my 8AM and just wake up to my 8AM and just miss out on just about anything that's on the test. So I think if I- if I repriorize what is important to me, I probably help me succeed. I mean, I had a 3.5 GPA in high school. So I know I could do this here"
College is all about making choices. Can you please share your beliefs and values that influenced your decision to drink?
"Um, I mean education is really important to me and-and also to my family. My parents are always talking about it and I really- I really really really wanna be an international journalist, to be on the news like,. So I guess if I repriorize my- if I reprioritize what I need to do I and I wont drink so much. I probably wouldnt be disappointed my parents and I would get a really good education"
Thanks for coming out to participate today. Your sanction will involve being placed on university disciplinary probation and attending an alcohol education seminar that costs 150
"Well, well, well. When is the seminar?"
Would you mind answering some questions and kind of doing a self evaluation about how you feel around alcohol and the contraception?
Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure
"okay. ok. ok. So we are working on a 10 point scale 1 to 10, 1 being not important, 10 being very. One being not confident, one being very confident. So on a scale of 1 to 10, which number best reflects how important it is to you to drink the-- what risk limits?"
I'd say an 8.
"You would say an 8. okay. ok. ok. And on a scale of 1 to 10, how confident are you at the present time that you can drink below risk levels?"
I'd say a 4.
Amount of 4.
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"okay. ok. ok. And so we have to look at those two. You- you think its pretty important but your confidence is down here, uh, a four but its not a one. What makes you confident that you can drink below your risk levels and remember what those are?"
"Um, I think it's because you told me I was at risk and I have alcoholism in my family and I really don't want to go. So I-I'm confident that I can change that at this point"
okay. ok. ok. So this gives you a good reason not to drink. okay. ok. ok. Anything else?
"Um, well, I have a group of friends that doesnt drink that I hang out with. And I think when I hang out with them it's not an issue. So that helps me too"
So you have a support group that gives you the ability to have fun and still drink below risk levels?
Yep. Thats it. That
okay. ok. ok. Anything else?
Nope. Not at all.
"Let your birth control self-evaluation begin now. So now we do the risk of pregnancy and the use of birth control. So on a scale of 1 to 10, how important is it to use effective birth control every time you have sex to keep"
I'd say an 8.
"An eight. An eight. okay. ok. ok. And on a scale of 1 to 10, how confident are you at present time that you- that you can use effective birth control?"
"Every time,-"
Every time. Every time.
- probably a 6.
Correct as it is.
Probably a 6.
Probably a 6. okay. ok. ok. So you're pretty confident that you can do this. And why is it a 6 and not a 2 or 3?
"Um, I'm a 6 because I think if I drink less I'll be more reliable with using birth control. I'm a very small person and I tend to not use it when I'm-- I'm drinking too much and I don't really care"
"okay. ok. ok. So, it's kinda linked to your drinking, the fact that, um, that you can--if you can take care of that drinking,"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-birth control issue and this importance comes down as your reason why youre down here.
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes
"Very good. Well done. So it looks like, um, you use a good method of birth control, you just cant use it effectively. And you linked it back here to the drinking. So would you like to develop a plan around your alcohol use at this--today?"
"Before I leave? Oh, wait."
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes
okay. ok. ok.
"okay. ok. ok. And if you need more info, we can get that for you."
okay. ok. ok.
okay. ok. ok.
"Before you leave, mind if I check the questionnaire you filled out before going?"
okay. ok. ok.
"Thanks. For the follow. I want you to know that whenever patients and I talk about alcohol and drugs, my role is to share information and learn. Does this make sense?"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Awesome. Great. So, you wrote here that you used alcohol on at least 8 days in 2016?"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Somewhere around 8 days. I don't think so.
okay. ok. ok. How would you describe your drinking?
"Um, I really only drink at parties. Im not drinking at home or anything"
okay. ok. ok. What kind of alcohol do you drink at parties?
"Um, liquor, whenever people mix, um, vodka, sometimes beer, but I dont like beer very much. Um, the drinks at parties are usually like vodka and orange juice or gin and tonics."
How much do you think you usually drink at parties?
You mean the whole time?
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes
"Um, probably 4 or 5 drinks."
"Speaker 1: Okay. Did you check the box here that drinking helps you feel relaxed, feel better about yourself or fit in?"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Makes me feel relaxed
"Also, you check that sometimes you forget things when youre drinking."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
What kind of things do you forget?
"Um, I'm forgetting how many drinks Ive had like when a friend asks me or I forget whose house I am"
Sometimes you forget where you are.
Right. Right. Right.
"Here's the part where I share information. Zero drinking for teenagers is the safest level of drinking. That's because we know a number of negative things are more likely when adolescent drink. We know alcohol can harm how the brain grows as an adolescent and teens who drink more than. Sexual assault is another thing more likely to happen and so are sexually transmitted diseases. I'm curious, do you think your drinking has anything to do with what the possibility of having an STI?"
"Um, yeah. Last time I had sex I was drinking. Um, this guy was drinking too much and we didn't use a condom."
Remember giving consent when you had sex?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We had sex before and used a condom before
How do you think drinking alcohol affected using a condom this time?
"Well, we've just not stopped putting one on. We werent thinking that way."
Does drinking change how you think in those moments?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. If I was sober I would definitely have told him to put on a condom
"There's something else I wanna share. When people forget where they are or how many drinks they had that shows heavy drinking. And when people keep drinking despite experiencing negative consequences, that can be a sign of what we call alcohol use disorder."
"Well, that's not me. I'm not in need of help."
I'm curious. What do you like about drinking alcohol?
"Um, well, this is fun. Drinking while my friends are drinking too is my favorite thing. Um, I'm laughing more. It's just fun."
okay. ok. ok. And what about your drinking do you not like it?
"Um, I'm not a fan of forgetting where I'm at sometimes."
Anything else?
I'm really not okay with STDs.
"Right. Right. Right. You like having a relaxed feeling when you drink and on the other hand, you dont like forgetting where you are"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"So, when you think about what you like and not like about your drinking, where do you wanna go. What would you change about your drinking?"
Definitely not drinking again.
"How ready are you to not drink too much. If I asked you to pick a number on a scale of 0 to 10, and 10 being totally ready, what number would you pick?"
"Um, a 9. A 9."
Very ready to stop drinking too much. Why do you think you picked such a high number like 9 rather than a lower number like a 6 or a 7?
"Well, I really dont have STDs and dont like wondering whether I have one or not."
okay. ok. ok. What plan could you come up with to make sure you reach that goal?
"Um, well, I wanna count my drinks so I dont get more than 2 and quit drinking once I start feeling drunk"
Awesome. Great. Who could help you reach this goal?
"Well, this is me with this friend who thinks Im drinking too much. I would probably be willing to make me promise not to have more than 2 drinks at a party."
okay. ok. ok. And how about unprotected sex. That sounds like you dont want to experience that again
I need to talk to him and make him promise that we always use condom and that we dont have sex drunk
"Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. So, you are very motivated to change your drinking and have a plan to keep from drinking more than 2 drinks at parties and. I'd love to share how this works for you. How do you feel about coming back in 6 weeks or so?"
okay. ok. ok.
Awesome. Great. Thanks for having me and looking forward to seeing you again soon
"So, Chris, I wanted to talk to you. Um, you know, you're one of our star athletes. I really value you as a team player. As Athletic Director, one of my jobs is to, kinda, keep tabs on the players and make sure everybody is performing at. And something came up this weekend. I heard some chatter about a big party that went down and understand you were there. So I wanted to talk to you about how partying and alcohol fits in your life right now."
"Okay, oh actually, could you confide something in me that has been bothering me lately. I was a honor student and my parents, like, kept me very, like k-kept me, like, k-kept down out of the, like so-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"And, um, about a month ago, my friends invited me to a party. And they used the fact that, Oh, I always do my homework, I always study that to allow me to go to the. And on--well, that party, I managed to convince my parents that I could spend the night at my friend's. So, thats when I started drinking."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"It was a- it was unique experience, as you can say. I guess you can say. And, I'm not sure, I-- It was fun, at least, in the moment. So, I've kept doing this. So I asked my-- I begged my mom to let me go to another rave this past weekend then. And she, kinda, knew what I was doing. I asked her to, like, promise me no alcohol, no drugs. Then I'll pick you up by 12:00. And I-I was shocked. 12:00, that's basically when the party starts but I told her whatever-- I thought to myself that I'll-I'll-I'll-I'll-I'll-. So she-- I promised her that-- She dropped me off, I promised her no alcohol, nothing. So I--we're going, I'm having fun like I did before. And I was drinking. And then the time came for her to pick me up. And as soon-- I couldnt delay her from picking me up. And as soon as she picked me up, and I stepped in the car, she said, ""you're drinking vodka."". And I was like, I-I didn't know what to say. Just looked at the floor. And I-I feel awful because I-I betrayed my mother. I've broken my trust with her that she expects me not to indulge in alcohol. And thats exactly what I did."
"So, here you are. You are an honors student. You are an athlete. You are a star. You, kinda, started getting more involved in the party scene, and maybe last month, you started getting more"
Right. Right. Right.
And it was fun at first. But you already notice some consequences now.
"Yes, right. Right. Right. Like I noticed I was more lethargic and apathetic towards schoolwork."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"I kinda just sit in class like-- I-- my mind is elsewhere, especially on weekends, where instead of-- I was-"
It really changed your focus. What do you like to drink?
"I'm not sure. It-Its because Im a very reserved person, for the most part, not when- not when I deal with sports or like--. I'm very self conscious, I'd say. I tend to keep to myself because I'm very self conscious. And when I- when I drink, I feel, I dont know, like, relaxes me. I find it easier to talk or engage with other people more easily. I'm not sure it just constitutes"
"So, it helps, kinda helps, loosen up, feel more relaxed."
Exactly. Exactly.
"Sounds like you notice quite a few not so good things about alcohol tho your mom got mad at you, you have, kinda,"
Kind of.
-or any other things?
"Just different groups, friends or groups, girlfriends, like different people that I hang out with because certain p"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"So, that-that-that also changed."
"So, your-your friends that you hung out with, there's a little tension there now."
"A bit because not all of them are into that. So, like, I have one group of friends, and I would talk to another person that's another group of friends and they"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"So, Ive been hanging out more with them, getting to know them. But I can also see that oh, I just live life, I guess. But that also doesn't make them fair to me as much as I was before."
okay. ok. ok.
"You know, as they are there for me."
"Well, given that you sort of noticed all these changes where it affects your friendships, it affects your study. Where do you think you should kinda go from here?"
"Oh um, I feel I should st-stop. I mean, like, I'm not-not- unrealistic. I'm understanding that situations like this will happen."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Its just up to me not to take it so far, where I cant remember the night before, if I puk. All I remember is toilet-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
-that-that's-that-that-that's-that-that-. And I gotta slowly build back trust with my mother because that was that one big blow. It's little so I guess may seem to other people.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
But to me then it's a big thing
your mom is so important
Of course. Of course.
Its important to know how she feels about you.
Exactly. Exactly.
"How important is it to make, uh, an adjustment in your drinking or even quit?"
A lot at this point because I feel that's a huge factor with gaining back trust with my mother.
okay. ok. ok.
Also getting back on top of my school work again my athletics too
okay. ok. ok.
So I feel that there-there is a future in that
How confident are you that you could actually change your drinking or-or even cut down or quit?
"I'm pretty confident, especially."
O-on a scale of 1 to 10 where one is not at all 10 is completely what number would you give.
Probably like an 8 or 9
okay. ok. ok.
And that cant be a ten there is nothing as ten in life I feel. Like there are too many factors but I feel like I'm determined to.
Why did you say 8 or 9 rather than 6 or 7?
Because I'm not sure I feel deter-determined to-make sure this happens because I don't like how I felt after I-I. I'm not a fan of remembering that feeling of like vomiting.
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"This isnt a pleasant experience. Uh, it's not something that I wish to enjoy. So like even if I do drink to the point where that happens, like all the fun that I have and prior to that just"
"Ok, what do you think of realistic goals then?"
Making sure I get my degree. Well first try to get- back my trust mother-
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
-then just focus on my studies. If I have leisure time like I will go party with my friends and just be as a party with them doesnt mean I drink. And theres nothing to do with me either. I do one cup of tea and thats that. But I would prefer not to do that. I prefer just make sure
"So your goal is kinda to not drink at all or if you are at a party, uh, a max of one at the very most"
Exactly. Exactly. Just so I can take part with the social convention but it's not. Hey guys. This is for you.
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Chris, I really appreciate you talking to me about this. I know that sounds like something that has been on your mind as it is and, like I said I really care about you as a student and an athlete. So glad we got to talk about this. Really like you know, really striving for not drinking alcohol at all and if you find yourself in a situation where th. This sounds like something that will work for you."
And-and thank you for listening to me. Means a lot to me
This is my-- yeah this is my pleasure. This is part of my job and it probably looks like this so. I need to hurry up and get changed for practice
Thank you for coming out to see me today Nina. I look forward to getting to know you a bit and hearing a bit about you and what brought you in today.
"Um, my doctor referred me. He said I gotta come because Ive- Ive been a little irresponsible with this pregnancy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah."
okay. ok. ok. He thought you were being irresponsible
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um, he said that I was drinking too much with that one. Um, I-I havent been a lot, but he said it was still maybe, um, would screw things up."
And you feel kinda concerned
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like I'm not- I'm not screwing anything up with this baby, but, um, yeah, I'm just- I'm scared I already did"
"okay. ok. ok. So, you are concerned about the consequences, and you really want to give your child the best start you can."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
And you wonder a bit about this time that we spend together
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I really didnt know what to expect from him. Just said, ""Go- go see her as well"""
"So here you are today and, um, sharing that you have been drinking alcohol throughout your pregnancy."
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um, I didnt find out I was pregnant until probably 2-ish months in-"
okay. ok. ok.
"-and Ive already been drinking then. Um, I really tried not to, but, y'all, weekends come around, and, um, all my friends are kind of partying and stuff,"
"Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. So, theres this external pressure coming from the people you care about to sort of stay in the scene."
"A little bit. A little bit. I'm thinking if I-if I talk to them, it would be cool, but it's-it's weird, right. Like I'm the only person that's, like, taking this step and having a kid, and they don't really know how to"
"Kind of feels like You're between two worlds. In one world, prepare to be a mother and bring a child into this other world, and this other world is the world that you have"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-drinking and your friends are-
"I'm still, like, only in my 20s, and-for everyone else, it's like, ""Okay, it's party time,"" and now I kinda"
"okay. ok. ok. So, this party-time world- are you feeling like this is something you want to move out of and move into that mom world. Or does hanging out there still feel like I wanna hang out there?"
"Yeah, there's part of me that still wants to live that out because I don't have another chance, like once this kid comes. I know I'm gonna- I know I'm gonna have to change."
"You feel like once the baby comes and actually in your arms, then things change, but right now, while you're pregnant,. Time to get off the mom world maybe"
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Probably. Also, I feel like its too late for me to be feeling this way. Im already screwed."
"okay. ok. ok. So, you have a lot of concerns about what happened to-up until this point, as far as your drinking. What do you know about, um, drinking alcohol throughout pregnancy?"
"Well, like, they say not to, but I thought because my friends didn't really care, I thought, ""Okay. Like maybe-maybe it doesnt matter. Maybe it's just what they tell you. I mean, in general, drinking is bad. Just like drinking."
"So, you thought because your-your-friends weren't pressuring you to stop drinking, that-that must be"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
And then there's this other part of you that's- was thinking maybe it's not okay
"Yeah, like, I should probably have trusted my gut."
"So, your gut tells you what. Tell me about that."
I know what I'm doing and it's probably hurting my kid and that- that I'll really regret that once I actually get my
"And you really want to do whats best for your babe. And kinda wondering, um, how to move forward from here, is that where yall wanna, yall know, give up drinking?"
"Um, I definitely think I could-- I think I could probably do it. It just- it-comes hard when youre, like, in that moment. You around your friends and they drink and you dont wanna be- you dont wanna be the mom at that moment. Wanna be yourself. Be who you were before."
"So, you kinda have this identity, dual identity going on. i wanna be that person yet, that person-"
"And so many people, when they have kids, just disappear from their friends. And I'm not that person. I'm not that person that just has a kid and they're completely-completely-different people."
"Mm. the mf. So, embracing this picket fence and the, you know, the little house and having the baby in this-"
"Yeah, suburbs. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah."
"So, don't be that- that woman that just sort of lives in this house with the baby carriage, and at the same time, that world"
"Yeah, I-I guess. Like, dont wanna- I dont wanna- I dont wanna- I dont wanna- I dont wanna- I dont. And I dont want to put pressure on them to change because they are, I mean, good people. They justphalous"
They matter to you.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Its just the scene that they-they-they still-they-they-they-they-still-they-they-they-. And so it is. And so it is. And so it is. And so it. Yall want the baby but you know the suburbs and picket fence thing is a no brainer. You don't know Goldberg factor
I'm not okay. I'm not okay. I'm not
You're not getting that.
No. No no no no no
This baby is what you want.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"And you wanna be, um, take care of your baby as the baby grows."
"Like, I wanna- I wanna be responsible for this thing."
Dont let your baby down.
No. No no no no no
"And at the same time, it's hard to let go of the past, but on the other hand, you think, ""I'm not a choice."". I had to look this way."". Is this what it feels like?"
I guess so. This is making me feel like I already made some bad choices and already made some bad choices with this
"Nina, I wonder, what is your hope for the future. Um, what do you hope for when you look back at where you are today?"
"Well, I-I kept the kid because I wanted-- It was almost like that push, that sign for me to, like, move forward and become. I still feel like a teenager sometimes like I-. And having that push to be a real person is really-- It's a lot of pressure and I- I want to raise this kid well. Im not gonna- I dont wanna let my kid down. I dont wanna regret choosing to have this kid because I think its the right time, but I dont- I dont wanna- make mistakes that make me"
"Baby really- it was almost like a sign for you that was saying, ""This baby gives you a new chance at life, or gives you a plan B"
"Yeah, just guessing it's easier said than done though. Like, great, can make all these changes and be a completely new person, but it's, like, at the end of the day"
"And theres a part of you that says, ""I still that girl that was drinking and partying,"" and-and-"
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I just- you know, you can't just one day flick a switch and become a new person."
"While this baby feels like this is your second chance, you wonder, ""Do I deserve that second chance?"". And another part of you that says, ""why not. Its here and I wanna go for it"
"Yeah, I guess that voice just stifled the other one a bit more."
"Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. You got a lot of people around you that are kinda pulling it down, and it kinda takes you back to the old life. And the baby is a constant reminder that there’s this new life ahead."
"Yeah, it will be very different when it actually comes out."
"Embrace this new life, and take that different route, turning away from path A and moving into path B, how confident are you that you can take path B"
Think I need to be successful. I'm not really- I'm not really- I'm not really- I'm not. Like I gotta- gotta take that route
"Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. Tell me more about that, what makes you say, ""I gotta take that route"". What makes you feel like you need that?"
Because I need to for my kid. This- itll be all screwed up if I dont
"This is the kind of thing that says, ""I'm not an option to-make this life better,"" it's wondering, ""Do I have the confidence to be. What do you think you need to increase your confidence that you can do this?"
"I dont know, like, maybe- maybe actually talking to my friends and saying like- or maybe them actually being able to see this kid. You--"" Maybe it would, you know, give them a wake-up call too if They actually, like, see"
"So you think, um, once your mates see you with the baby in your arms that they too will see that there"
Or at least they'll feel less pressure to be who they want me to be.
"Mm, kinda feel you pull between two worlds there"
A little bit. A little bit.
"Easy to be in that world and also having that constant reminder that the baby is coming and this baby is saying, ""I want this better life. Who can support you, do you think when-you look around who is in your circle right now, who can you see as a"
"Definitely need to, uh, go and meet some other-people who are maybe, you know, having kids too so that I can see,. So I'm not really in a relationship with anyone in my life that I know that Ive had kids recently. So I-I would like to meet other, you know, young moms out there who, you know, are struggling with the same stuff I"
"And your parents are a support for you and support you from giving up alcohol, the alcohol use, that's something that"
"I'm not sure they realize, uh, that I do or how much I do."
okay. ok. ok.
"And I know that if they found out, they would be really mad"
They would be a concern to you as well as to you now.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um, maybe you and I could meet again about-and talk about having those conversations with-"
"I'm thinking so, like the telling my parents and [unintelligible 00:13:45] this to my parents is probably the scariest"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"And having to talk to these friends, like right now I dont want to do that. This- it's putting them in a weird place."
Kind of feels like youre climbing Mt. Everest. For. The. F
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
And you're not equipped.
feeling like i gotta lec- i dont wanna have to lecture them and dont want it to be like a lecture
You are concerned that they are going to treat you like a child.
my parents or my friends?
"Lol, you mean your friends"
Lecture my-- Yeah.
You wonder if theyll be kind like children and youre gonna be like the parent saying-
Yeah and I dont wanna be like this
Just wanna be like peers talking.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
And you want them to support you.
I wanna stay friends with them. im not okay- i dont want- they just-
"Yall dont wanna lose yall support group, yeah. Yall just wanna them to support you in being healthy while helping you, raising the babe, and so we. You dont wanna lose them, just maybe the lifestyle it sounds like."
"Yeah, like if theres a- if theres a balance between maybe not the paths, but the worlds, if"
Mm. the mf. You kinda wanna have the best of both worlds
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"I want the friends and the relationship that I get from my friends, and at the same time, I dont want the party scene that"
"Yeah, like I-I know I just can't cut off my friends entirely."
"You know you best, you know the support that your friends give you and the support that you get from your. And I-I really just wanna support you in being able to make those choices and have those conversations,. I just wondering, is there some steps that you would be willing to take or consider in a next visit, um,"
"Um yeah like Im so close anyways, that I know I need to now. Um, and I just, like, have I completely screwed this up, like, is it too late?"
"You are concerned about your childs health. Nina, that every day without alcohol is a good day for your child, and you know, starting today to have zero alcohol"
"Mm-hmm, gotta do."
Ok sounds like this is really important. Make this happen.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Is there anything that I can support before we wrap up as far as giving up alcohol today?
I'm not okay. I'm not okay. Just knowing that its not too late already is enough kick in the pants to get started
You kinda got a reality check today
A little bit. A little bit.
"I really enjoyed talking with you today, and I thank you so much for just sharing your heart."
Hi are you Katie?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Hi my name is Beth. I am the nurse that works with the nurse practitioner Mrs. Smith that you just watched. You got a moment to talk?
"Uh, sure. What is this about?"
"I know you were here to get a prescription for birth control but while you were waiting to see Mrs. Smith, you filled out a healthy habits"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"-and you answered some questions about your marijuana use. If I had some questions about how marijuana plays a role in your life, would it be okay to ask?"
Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure
"I'm noticing you use cannabis regularly, and wanted to ask more about that."
"Well, you know they just decriminalized it in Virginia, it's not a big deal. Am I in trouble? No, no, no, no, no"
"No. No no no no no. Nah, nah. No. Not at all. Um, just wanted to ask how this helps you and how you use it. Can you tell me a bit more about how you use it?"
No offense. Not a big deal. Just relax for a few times a week.
Marijuana helps you relax?
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I'm here on an academic scholarship so I have to keep my grades up and I'm on the debate team, so"
Mm. the mf. You are a very successful student and your stress really adds to your stress.
"Yeah, yeah. Well, yeah. The truth is I am the first in my family to go to college so I dont know, I guess, I am in over my head"
Mm. the mf. You were very successful academically and the transition to college was hard for you.
Ive always been an anxious person. Pot just helps me calm my nerves. Am I in trouble? No. Am I in trouble
"I promise you youre not in trouble, I wanna help"
"Uh, tell me besides helping you relax, what are some positives about pot?"
"Well, some of these kids are just so sophisticated that I guess when I party with them I feel like I fit in. I'm not sure how else to explain this."
"Hmm. Interesting. Uh, when you use pot in a group you feel more at home with your peers and more accepted?"
"Idk if I feel more accepted, more like Im trying to fit in by using it."
So how is it helping you fit in?
I cant believe this is real.
Mm. the mf. So smoking pot with your peers to try to fit in more but it doesnt seem to make you feel more comfortable with your
"Uh, yeah. Yeah."
What are some downsides to smoking pot?
"I'm not sure. I- It helps relax but I guess I'm nervous I'll get caught. Um, my parents would kill me if they knew that I smoked."
So smoking pot doesnt help you feel more socially comfortable with your peers and it increases your stress because you
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Can you think of any other downsides to smoking pot?
"Well, I'm not the one with the money for that. I'm just usually bumming it off to my roommate, her parents give her a lot of spending money but I don't know,"
So smoking pot also remind you of your financial situation and you dont have extra cash to spend on things?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Sounds like smoking pot helps you somewhat relax and it also causes you a lot of stress because you try to use it. Having said all that, what do you want to do about your pot use?"
I'm not sure. It doesnt sound like a very good habit when you put it that way.
Would it be okay if I made a suggestion?
okay. ok. ok.
"You mentioned at the beginning of our conversation that you have a history of dealing with anxiety, have you ever talked to a coun"
No. No no no no no. My family is so understanding and understanding. We're not doing that kind of stuff.
Can you say more?
It just doesnt get done. I'm not sure. This is something for crazy people and we definitely do not have the money for it
Mm. the mf. So the idea of counseling in your family is for crazy people only and it looks down upon and the cost would
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Just not seeing this happening
"Many kids do so well in college and have so much stress and deal with a lot of anxiety, and we also found that. Um, and it's been really successful for a lot of kids. Um, I wonder if this might be helpful for you?"
I'm not sure.
Can you describe why you are hesitant?
"Well, I'm not the one with the money so I can't pay for it and my parents wouldn't approve"
"Well, the cost is free and the counseling services we provide, legally obligated to protect your privacy. Your parents can't tell us. There are some exceptions to that privacy rule, including, uh, mostly if we concern- that your safety."
"What, like suicidal?"
Exactly. Exactly.
"Uh, I would never do that."
"If you decide to see our counselor about what-what privacy rules there are, but for the most part, you wouldn't need to"
okay. ok. ok. guess im gonna have to think about that
"So, uh, if-if you walk outside now, I can walk outside with you and just take you around our counseling center. One of the counselors I can even introduce you to"
Do I have to go there?
No. No no no no no. Nah. No. No. No. Just wanted to show you where it is and let you know about our resources here at the college.
"Oh, yeah, sure. Agree, lets go."
This whole deal just makes me feel helpless
You hopeless about what is going on.
Mm. the mf. This whole deal just makes me feel helpless
You seem at a loss of where to go from here.
No one wants to help me
You're feeling like people aren't willing to help.
No one wants to help me
Feel lonely.
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. Really shouldnt have done that
This is something you shouldnt have done. You realize it.
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. Really shouldnt have done that
You are feeling regretful.
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. Couldnt help myself.
"Uh, this is something that just happened."
Couldnt help myself.
You are nervous that you have lost control of your behaviors.
It's actually been a fabulous week
You really had a good week
It's actually been a fabulous week
Sounds like you're excited about that.
"Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. I know who to hang out with, I aint stupid."
You definitely know how to make good decisions.
"I know who to hang out with, I aint stupid."
"Um, positive peer influences have been helpful for you."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. I let the whole family down. I had such high hopes for them
Feeling like you let your family down.
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. I let my whole family down. I had such high hopes for them
They make you feel like you were a disappointment
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. This is not what I want for my life
This is not what you envisioned.
This is not what I want for my life
You are willing to take steps to improve on that.
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. Really want to get off the program
You're not here. You're not wanted.
Really want to get off the program
Sounds like you're motivated to follow the rules.
"Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. Im still craving smoking, even though Ive stopped"
Its something that always stays on your mind
"Im still craving smoking, even though Ive stopped"
"It takes a lot of, um, strength to still not smoke, even though you crave it."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Well, welcome, Ricky."
Thank you. You are welcome.
Nice to meet you.
"Yea, you too."
And you found us okay?
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Alright. Thats it. That
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. pretty straightforward-
Yeah
-Always good.
Have you been here before?
"No. No no no no no. Nah, not at all."
"Mm. the mf. okay. ok. ok. Alright. Thats it. That. Well, um, I know a little about why you are here today-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"-um but it's great to see you, and so maybe a good point to start with is, tell me why you're here"
"Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure. Ive had sorta like this group of friends come around to my place, and um, you know, they-. Then, I sorta sorta sorta sorta sorta sorta sorta sorta sorta. I was annoyed at first glance, but then I thought about it for a bit and then I was like, ""Well, I suppose it can't hurt to talk to someone about it."""
Right. Right. Right.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
And that led you to being here today?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Alright. Thats it. That
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. just sort of did a bit of internet searching and stuff and just read about this place, so I just thought I'll Cynthia"
"Right. Right. Right. So it sounds like you thought there was something that, uh, that you needed to look at, something that was concerni"
"Yeah, I guess. I suppose I didn't really think about it until they sat me down, and you know- I could, uh, understand a bit of where they"
They were concerned for you?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Alright. Thats it. That
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, which kind of sh-shocked, I suppose."
You've been surprised?
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, 'cause, you know, I'm not sure. You know, you see on movies when people sort of intervene or say, ""You need to go and get help."". And then-- I dont know. Like you know those characters and, they-they-do-need-help, you know-"
Yep. Thats it. That
- because they are fucked.
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"And you kinda go, ""Woah. Thats not me."". So its about am Iphalous"
You dont think thats apply to you?
"Yeah, or well, not to that extent, you know what I mean. Like, I-I would--l didn't think I'd ever need to sit down and intervene with-"
okay. ok. ok.
-if you know what I mean.
Alright. Thats it. That
I suppose.
"I'm trying to understand you so far, something is bothering you and something is bothering your friends-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-but you don't know whether it's- whether- just how bad it is or- and you just want to check that out?
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, 'cause, I mean, you know, they're my friends and-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"- you know, I don't think I'll be so narrow-minded as to say for sure that, you know, they're entirely wrong '. And they do care, so obviously there's something there that I might have overlooked. But on another note, I sort of feel like, ""Well, was that bad?"". And you know, ""Was that- was that really necessary?"". But I, you know, thought I'd give them the benefit of the doubt and-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-and just check it up yep
"Because they care about you and-and you respect what they say, and you wonder whether something about th"
"Yeah, pretty right."
Alright. Thats it. That
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Well, lets do some checking out."
Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool
"So tell me a bit about what you do, what is- what is the concern that they are raising."
"Um, dr-drugs, I suppose."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Mm, yeah. sort of do a bit of P now and again-"
Alright. Thats it. That
"-and, um, I guess less often, I do a bit of, you know, I smoke a bit and, um, party pills in the- in the weekend"
okay. ok. ok.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Say a bit about what now and again means, and-and-and how often."
"Um, a few times a week maybe"
"Is this- is this with, uh, with the drugs?"
"Yeah, yeah."
This is meth you mean. A few times a week?
"Mm-hmm yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I guess when I put it that way, it sounds quite a lot, but it doesnt feel a lot, you know. If you know what I mean?"
"We can check that out to see whether-whether it's a lot or-and-what your concerns are about it. But help me understand a bit more of what it feels like for you. Say- say what are the things about your, uh, use of meth that you- that you found good for you?"
"Right. Right. Right. Um, I suppose it's kinda hand in hand with just hanging out with, sort of, some new scene that I--"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"And, um, I'm still living in Palmy and, so as you can imagine, it's sorta diff. Um, kinda just when I first got here I was sorta introduced to, um, like do you know Family Bar on-on [unintelligible 00:06:49]?"
"Yes, I know Family Bar."
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This is the sorta- that sorta- that sorta- that sorta- that sorta- that sorta-. And like, it's not something I'd really thought about before and-- But then kinda hung out there and just met these p. But they do, in Auckland bars like that you can just-- Uh, you can just be it out in the open, you know, and I suppose. Um, so just to arrive and see that and kind of meet these people that were just really friendly, you know, and-. I'm not sure. Palmy often be like, ""Oh, you gotta own a car, and soap it up, and drive up and down Main St."". Or play rugby and, you know, that didnt interest me at all and sorta come here and have people, you. Im just trying to get out and dance and stuff like that. Um, that was quite cool to know that existed because I hadn't seen that before and- I suppose there's a lot that"
"Its quite a heavy party scene most weekends and stuff. So it kinda goes hand in hand with that really, and just, you know, I guess when I have- a slight-- I don't know, you. Happiest, excited and just surrounded by people that, y'all, really care about you, and love you and-- Coming from a place where y-you. And it just hits you like, ""I know- I know I'll feel good."". I guess thats part of it"
"So Auckland, coming to Auckland from Palmerston for you was-was like taking charge of something that you look to make"
"Yeah, in-in a way. Although I wouldnt have been conscious of that. Just sort of discovered this here. Not like I came to Auckland looking for that kinda-"
Right. Right. Right.
"-lift to get away from, um, you know parents mainly, and that sort of lifestyle, that Palmy sort. But then yeah, I discovered this other thing, umphal"
Which you didnt know in Palmerston?
No. No no no no no
okay. ok. ok.
"No. No no no no no. I didnt really know. I guess you see sort of things like this in-in movies from America you know, but you"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"- think that this would exist in your own country. Well, not if you grew up in Palmy."
Palmerston. Thats it. That. Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Um, I'm not mean to Palmy but, y'all, this is just the different kinda attitude, I guess, kinda- this done-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-to that sort of thing.
Sounds like you are ready to move up to something that was different.
Yes-
And-and you came-
-plus-
-Here to Auckland.
"Yeah, yeah. Definitely wanted to get away from something. I didnt know what too but then I arrived here and found this thing that was like actually, this was obviously, fate or whatever"
Alright. Thats it. That
-'cause-'cause like I found something in myself or something that was missing.
And how does that feel for you now?
"Um, now, I guess, just a little bit of use to this. [clears throat] when i first got here, i was like, ""wow this is amazing"". This is hard, I guess, but, y'all, it's been 3 years now, so, it's just kinda like I'm used to it."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"I mean, I guess, I take it for granted but, um, yes, it's just comfortable now. And, um, just a sort of what I do. Yeah, so, I suppose that drugs are linked to that, I suppose. It's j-- Well, it's just a part of it, I don't really think-- I didn't differentiate it. It just kinda, ""Okay, I'll just hang out with my friends,"" and that sort of thing, you know, that Saturday, Friday evening. And just like that, it just happens"
So coming out feeling--being gay-
Yep. Thats it. That
"-being part of a gay culture here in Auckland, feels good-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-for you? -for you? -
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"And at the same time, it-it links closely with the-with the drug scene with the meth scene for you?"
Yep. Thats it. That
And you don't experience where these two things are separate. They just seem to be together more often than not?
"Well, I guess, now, that I'm thinking about it, maybe it's sort of gone beyond that, maybe I didn't notice that"
Sophalous
"I mean, like I always--well, it's, y'all know that's kind of a thing that happens in the weekends but, I guess, sometimes in the weekdays. I'll pretty much every weekend I'll have a big night, um, maybe 2 but sometimes, you know, in the weekdays like on a Tuesday or Wednesday or somethin. And I guess that's not entirely linked to that scene, I suppose."
Just sounds like something is bothering you that there's-there's a part link there but there's no link and that-that
Mm. the mf. Maybe. Maybe not. I suppose I didn't really think about that-
okay. ok. ok.
-Until recently.
So something has changed recently?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I suppose just since that kind of intervention thing or I started giving them the benefit of the doubt. And it-
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-might notice some things that I havent noticed but disproportionate
Tell me about those things you notice that you havent noticed before
"Lol, e-even just now, you know, when you asked me how often I would be"
That surprised you?
"Mm. the mf. When theres stuff, and you dont really think about it, but then when someone asked you, how often. It- it-"
Mm. the mf.
"-sounds shocking. But to me it- it- it's not feelin that way, you know, that's kinda where that, where it. I, [clears throat] that's why I kinda got miffed at my friends a bit, or I dunno, a bit defensive there. 'Cause yall know that sounds a lot, but it's not out of control or anything, yall know. Doesn't feel, idk, people that need to go and see therapists or whatever you kind of go, ""Oh, they're an addict."". You know. You know. They-- Their health is so bad and they need urgent help right now, Uh, well, at least that's kinda the-feel. And I'm not feeling that at all. I'm not feeling like this is a real urgent thing. So this-"
Alright. Thats it. That
-felt weird.
okay. ok. ok.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
So you worry a bit about it and you find out more about it but you-you don't take on this notion of being a headache or
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
okay. ok. ok.
Definitely. Definitely.
"So tell me then, um, Ricky, what-what is the other side of the good things that-that using meth or doing some smoking. Is there a downside. Are you experiencing issues?"
"Yep. Thats it. That. Um. Is. That. Okay. Uh, I suppose money is quite a thing. I use to have a lot more money sorta last year like, I'm not the same anymore. Got a, quite a, quite a, quite a, quite a, quite a, quite a, quite a"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Um, and it was like quite a lot of money that la-last year. So this wasnt such a problem then. And I suppose I sorta blew that money a bit. Um, so now I'm not getting that acting income coming in as regularly and I'm working in a cafe like a sorta. So now its kinda like, and sometimes I need to borrow a bit of money or sorta need a bit of help with the rent"
Quite a lot has changed over the last year from cardiovascular factor to relate
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. A little bit. A little bit.
Doesn't sound like it was part of the plan.
"No. No no no no no. But you know, that's the life of an actor, I suppose, ups and downs works and not works."
Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure. [chuckling] Not a secure profession-
No. No no no no no
-and it- it- hard-
It's not.
"-it's hard. I just wonder, is there a connection at all between the-the-acting and the meth use in terms of the effect of the"
Hmm. Interesting. Coulda been a few auditions that I didnt do so well and as I couldve 'cause of that
That drug may have had an effect?
"Uh, maybe. Maybe it's just my general sort of state. Um, I dunno, sometimes I suppose just kinda weighs on my mind like, ""What am I doing or why am I spending my own money on this. When this happens, it's like, this is amazing."
Hmm. Interesting. Hmm. Interesting.
"You know am I-- You go in- you go into places, interesting places, but you know, I could just as well have. But I dont know. I wonder if-if it-if it-if it-if it-if it-. I-I'm not sure. I can't say for sure, but maybe it's not so good for the face, I dunno. [crosstalk] Dunno if I look tired or-or run down or-"
Alright. Thats it. That
"-or if I actually am tired or running down, I suppose. Again, this is things that I havent actually thought about-"
Alright. Thats it. That
-but now I'm starting to think about.
Right. Right. Right. And they got questions too-
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-to ask are theyogrammed
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
You are beginning to-and-think about those things and-and-what effect they may have on you.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
And the choices that you might have about it.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Interesting.
"What else? Nothing else. Are-the-problem of around the use of money, you know, the choices that you make around money, and the meth use"
Yep. Thats it. That
"-over the last year and maybe also the effect on- um, your job and being able-- maybe not as well as"
Yep. Thats it. That
"Also, on-going physical appearance, maybe the effects um. Interesting question around the effect of meth use on physical appearance."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Um, what-- are there any other problems. Any other things that-that are a downside to this?"
"Uh, I guess it's clearly having some sort of effect on my flatmates and my flatmates, 'cause, you know, they set me"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-look into this or else we cant hang out anymore.
And this is a problem?
"That would be a problem, yeah."
Why? Why? Why? Why
"Well, if they didnt wanna hang out then what have I got, I suppose?"
They are important.
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah and I mean part of it, yeah. Part of it I just wonder 'cause, you know, a lot of those friends that set me up are obviously the ones that. I mean there was a few there that-that are, but mostly they were the ones that sorta. You know, like when I first started all this stuff, you know. Problem like-- 'cause I use to be that guy as well you know, like, ""No never do that 'cause it's bad,"" and then you try it the first time. Its not the end of the world if youre sensible with it then its not gonna be, you know."
"You gotta take stupid amounts to do any kind of like, or, you know, to die or to end up in a hospital."
YHmm. Yall.
"So it provides you dont-- you dont have to be stupid with it. Then its just fun but you cant really explain that to people who are--have their walls up. So it's hard not to sit in this room full of people kind of going, ""Oh, you know, you really should stop the drugs, they. It's like, ""Well actually, you don't know what you're talking about."""
"Hmm. Interesting. But Ricky, let me just check, because I may have got this wrong, just check with you that um, there are some friends that you. Did I get that right from what you said earlier that-those who are concerned about you and were part of this"
"Yep. Thats it. That. Yeah, a few."
And you-- So they have their concerns and- you are beginning to- ask questions of this use as
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Just that we are going to try and drill down a bit more into just to pick up for you what-you think might be some of the
Yep. Thats it. That
"And we g- we leave labels all that kinda stuff aside 'cause, you know, I pick up from you that's not what that"
Yep. Thats it. That
"I like that. I like that. What do you think, what might happen if you can turn your- your- uses- you're on now. What-what concerns do you have about not making any kind of change?"
"Um, well I suppose the acting thing is a really big concern."
Alright. Thats it. That
"'Cause I want that to be my job, you know. I fucking hate cafes."
This will be your career. This is career
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-you wanna make.
"I wanted this to be, yeah"
"Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. Its harder when youre trying to create your career, get that shit going. You gotta- you gotta be at your- at your- top, top pitch,"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Yeah, 'cause I mean it's all you know, it's partly lacking and partly being at the right place at the right time. And if you are at the right place and at the right time and it isnt on your game then there could be a Cynthia"
"Yeah, and-and maybe the meth use is-is compromised that."
"Yeah, that could be."
Hmm. Interesting.
"Also, I suppose, like money is linked to that as well, you know, I have-- I don't do as many courses and stuff as"
"Alright, so it's back to the money thing again which is-"
"Well, yeah, obviously I'm not gonna keep pissing off my flatmates."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"And you know, and it's not- it's not cool to not pay the rent, obviously. This is not something I like"
That creates problems?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah and I'm not that person
"Lets just come back to another thing, uh, that we were talking about a bit earlier, and its around your meth use as well and-. And-and this sounds like you say that-that-that when you party, when you go into the clubs, when you are being with"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
The-the- availability is there.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
And most people use.
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Not-not necessarily P or whatever but yeah most people are doing something. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Scene that there isnt a giant like, you know, you go to normal bars and most people are just drunk and wasted and like. Like, people drink but not to that excess but take other things and have a good time. And, yeah."
And it might be hard to be part of that scene and not use drugs?
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, there are people that do that. I suppose that-it would be hard. I-I havent actually thought about it, I suppose. Thats all that matters, all I know that scene to be, yall know-"
Right. Right. Right.
-so from the beginning it always exists
So theres a possibility that other parts of the scene arent dependent on drug use-
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-or particularly on- Meth use?
"Oh yeah, well, they must be. I can't imagine everyone is there, I guess just the ma-majority or at least p-- the majority of people that I know, yeah"
"We can look at but later if you are interested in is maybe what are some of those other parts of the gay scene, whose still party and party medley,"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Factor in partying, and we-where there are, uh, uh, gay groups that support people who-who are not-. So there are some options there to look at some other ideas if you are interested and we might look at-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"-to consider, so it's not about giving up something, it's about how can I improve the situation."
Yep. Thats it. That. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
This is what I hear you saying bring--be a bit more in control of what is-what is going on for me.
Yep. Thats it. That
So that I can pursue that plan.
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
What could be a- what could be a first step towards that?
"I must say I was a bit, um, you know, at the start when I was sort of saying I, you know, this is how often. I suppose, on a Wednesday by myself like it doesnt sound that good"
"So, does this need some thought, or is it just me?"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
As to what-
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-what would work for you-
Mm. the mf.
-as an alternative.
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but I think you're right about, just something to look forward to, because it's that midweek slump, you. So far away till people get in their place where they can-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-hang out and have fun.
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And theres things that gotta work for you, so that-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"-that's your ideas on there which are really important. But again there are some options, that if you wanted to look at, you know, just to at least be able to"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Because there are clubs and there are groups and there are all types of things that meet through the week.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"And so, though they won't be necessarily like the party scene, they are other activities. I'm referring to gay groups and gay activities which are an option that-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"-you know, good to know about and- maybe in-- within those options or something you might say, ""Oh yeah, I'd give that a go. Have a look."""
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Thats it. That
"He, um, introduced me to it too so I tried it"
"So with his encouragement, yall- yall tried some drugs."
Oxy. Thats it. That
You've tried oxy. okay. ok. ok.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
okay. ok. ok. And encouraged you to do that.
"Well, yeah he said it was pain- a pain medicine."
He said that it would help you with some of the pain that you have been going through.
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"And it has, but I dont do it as often, its just sometimes."
"okay. ok. ok. So you trusted him on that, and you tried it out and found that it helps in certain ways. What are some of the things that you said it takes--takes some of the pain away, it's not just--"
Dealing with my grandma losing her shit.
"Well, that helped you."
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm feeling lonely, and I just, I miss her and, it does- it helps but,-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. So this helps quantify
-I'm not gonna have to depend on having to take that
"okay. ok. ok. So it's not something you want to rely on, you don't see yourself continuing to use this. It's something that you found at least for the moment very helpful?"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. Yeah and differentiation
"But it's not something that you wanna make a habit of becoming reliant on, or dependent?"
Right. Right. Right.
"Yeah, okay. Um, and-so that's a lot going on right now for you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah."
"Yeah, it is."
"You managed in the best way you can. You also have some doubts about that too, sounds like?"
"Yeah, well, I'm not too sure about that, other than it makes me feel good."
Ok so for now you know that makes you feel good
"So Tom, this infection has been pretty painful for you but we have antibiotics. I think your infection will disappear if you take it faithfully for 10 days. Can you do that?"
Definitely. Definitely.
And do you mind if we talk about a screening form that you filled out earlier today on drug use?
okay. ok. ok.
"Lets take a look. It says on occasion that you use, uh, drugs other than medical reasons. Which drugs do you use?"
Im doing some meth.
"Snort it, smoke it?"
Snort it always snort it
Dont inject it? No way
Mm-mm. Thats it. That
Use any other drugs?
"Just, y'all, some alcohol."
"And, uh, um, how often do you do this?"
Meth? More like Meth?
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Um, 2, 3 times a month."
So you're an occasional meth user. You're not using this often?
Right. Right. Right.
Only snort it?
Right. Right. Right.
"Well, as I think you know, Methamphetamine use is associated with some health risks. And the amount that you use it-it puts you in a category that we consider a risky user. And that contrast with someone who it says addicted, um, someone who is a heavy user but it's not in a healthy category because p. And actually one of them is, um, sexually transmitted diseases. Is your STD associated with your Methamphetamine use?"
"Yeah, it could be because, uh, I was high when I had unprotected sex and wouldnt do that if I"
So you normally take care and use protection when having sex?
"Definitely, yeah."
And it seems meth may have clouded your judgement?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Anything else happening with Methamphetamine in your life. Does this affect you in any way?
"No, I mean, no. I mean, like I said, I only do this in clubs, you know, with my friends, uh, two or three times a month at-at the most. Um, uh, I'm not sure that's really having other impacts. But I-I'm concerned about this one. never expecting gonorrhea"
"Yeah, I'm concerned about that too and would actually recommend that you stop using Methamphetamine. And, um, there are a lot of reasons for this but that would be-that's-that's-that's-that's-that"
"I-I understand but it would be hard for me to do that to myself. I-I understand that. I mean, I know I should but, I mean, thats like my whole social life. Yall know I mean all my friends go to these clubs. Thats where- thats where I see them. I mean, thats basically my sex life and, uh, meth is just- it just a part of it. I mean, everyone does that there. You know, I mean, you know. So it's while I'd like to stop it's-it's kinda hard to think about doing that right away"
So you recognize Methamphetamine has some problems associated with it and you also on the balance see that a lot of your social
"Yeah, I'm not saying that I'm not willing to try but I'm not saying that I'm not willing to"
"Well, if you were to, um, consider how ready you are to stop using Methamphetamine-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
-with zero being not ready at all-
Mm. the mf.
"-and 10 being ready, where would you put yourself?"
"Uh, three."
Why not a one or a two?
"I mean, this has been really uncomfortable, yall know gonorrhea is a really bad experience. And, uM, I know I'm not the same, u know, when I'm- when I'm on it. And, uh, I mean, what I have is bad enough, I could easily get AIDS. HIV could get me the same way. So this scares me a lot. Thats why its higher than a single or two"
Are there any other concerns that you have about Methamphetamine?
"Well, I'm doing just snort it but you don't know what it's cut with, you know, there could be something, you. Um, if it was cut with something dangerous or something, it could be really bad. I mean, I-I'm worried about that sometimes."
"I thought that you'd have a very, um, not very, interest in not stop using Methamphetamine but it sounds like. And that might be cut with something else, um, you could get another ST- STD including HIV."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Um, what would you do to make it easier for you to cut down or quit using Methamphetamine?"
"Something else to do on weekends, different social life."
How could you get a different social life?
"Its the hard thing, I mean, almost every person I know uses it"
Is there anyone in your life who doesnt use methamphetamine?
My sister. My sister. My sister
Is she-- Have you talked to her about your meth use?
"I havent really talked to her about that. I think she knows that I do it sometimes. I mean, we're pretty close. I think I could talk to her about that, and I think she would probably help."
"So on the one hand, it would be difficult to quit using Methamphetamine because there are so many positives that you get. But on another, there are reasons why you want to quit using methamphetamine."
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes
And some things that you might be able to do that would make it easier to not use methamphetamine including talking to your s
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes
"Well, great. Great. I recommend that you not use Methamphetamine at all but what you do is up to you."
okay. ok. ok.
1 month left and I could see you again. Would that work for you?
"Yeah, sure."
Pretty good. Well done. It's been 3 months now.
Nice. Nice. Nice.
"Um, and differentiation"
"Since the-- since you used, uh, since the last time you used meth, right?"
Right. Right. Right.
okay. ok. ok.
Right. Right. Right. It's been 3 months and I'm still doing pretty well
Good. Good. Good. Good
"Um, and I've met a few new friends."
Nice. Nice. Nice.
Sophalous
"So-so, uh, have-- last time we talked, yall know, yall were kinda cutting the- ex-boyfriend out. This is because he was your dealer, so--"
Right. Right. Right.
And how is that for you?
Right. Right. Right. It was good. It was good. I havent responded to his phone calls-
okay. ok. ok.
"-and a few of my other friends tried to call me as well, and I still havent replied to their calls. Um, so it was good for me to just reach out and like, meet a few new people, um, in the neigh-neighborhood that I live in."
"So this sounds like youve made some good changes. The change in your environment, and some of your behaviors, and, uh, and these new friends."
"I use the, you know, the breathing exercises you taught me, when I get-- start to feel a bit stressed out, and I--. walking and doing my breathing exercises, it calms me down and kinda gets me through that time."
So this sounds like--
"Well, Catherine, welcome back. After we met last time, what-what were you--what have you been thinking about over the week 'cause, you know, I-"
Mm. the mf.
-what was different this time and your thoughts about coming out?
My expectations are a bit clearer as to why I'm here.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"I guess, I-- It made me think about how much money I have been losing recently. So, yeah. I'm happier here. [chuckles]"
"okay. ok. ok. ok. So, theres a shift from last time?"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. My sense is we can work pretty well together. That's my, sort of, sense of, uh-- After last time, I thought, you know, ""Here come some young women who, you"
Mm. the mf.
""" So, really, what we'd like to talk about today is-is get a sense of, um, get a sense of, over the next, you know"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"So, last time, was this issue of gambling, and, um, you were talking, about how the gambling had, sorta, got you into trouble"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I know, last time, you- started to say that, well, you- thought it was-- you deserved it and there was some thinking around that,"
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm happy to explore this, so to speak. [chuckles]"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Yeah, so how- How- How- You know, like-- 'Cause, sometimes, when we start to open things up, and then you think,. So, how do you manage things when you get uncomfortable. How did you manage those in the past?"
"Hmm. Interesting. I dunno, probably locked off a bit. [chuckles]"
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, how would I know if we were talking and you were blocking me. What would I notice, uh, in our session together?"
"Yeah, um. Yeah. I bet you already noticed. [chuckles] Um, I'm not sure, probably fidget."
Yeah? Oh yeah?
This is why I'm still a bit disproportionate
"Yeah, that's okay."
[chuckles]
"So-so, what would be really helpful maybe because I might miss it, you know, so, like, could you say. If differential was really helpful, it would be"
When I feel uncomfortable?
"Yeah, yeah. If you could just say, ""Ken, hi, I'm starting to, you know, tune it out here, starting to get uncomfortable,"" that would be"
okay. ok. ok.
Yeah? Oh yeah?
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Yeah, thanks for that, ok. -- has to do with how you just sorted out the thing around gambling 'cause last time you were here, you told me that you get a buzz,"
Mm. the mf.
"So, um, how serious is this issue to sort?"
[sighs] I suppose it's serious if I wanna get out of my-my-debt.
"Yeah, okay."
"Credit comes out of my ears, and mom and dad arent bailing me out anymore, so-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"-I suppose, gotta sort this out myself."
"okay. ok. ok. So, again, on a scale of 1 to 100, how serious--how important is it to sort it out. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah."
About 80. [chuckles]
"About 80? About 80? About 80. Right up there, yeah. And another question that's, sort of, related to that, how confident are you that you can, you know, get"
"I will say, I am completely confident."
"Yeah? Oh yeah. But, what would-"
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes
-your level be on a scale of 1 to 100. Where does your confidence sit?
"What, on my confidence to stop. [chuckles]"
"Well, to get it sorted. Not necessarily stopping. But we don't-we don't know whether-whether-stopping's the right answer here, I don't know, but-"
"Its hard when its part of your lifestyle, huh?"
Mm. the mf.
Me last night when I went with my girlfriends to the pub and hit a flutter-
Hmm. Interesting.
"-so, y'all, I think I'm a bit weird if I just sit-at-the-bar on my own. [chuckles]"
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah, so-so, you fluttered last night with them?"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Yep. Thats it. That. okay. ok. ok. ok. And-and when they stopped fluttering, did you still flutter or did you stop fluttering with them. Where-where was you with gulf ratio"
"Oh, had to stop halfway 'cause I'd run out of money. [chuckles]"
"okay. ok. ok. okay. ok. ok. okay. ok. ok. Yeah, yeah. So, you said before that, you know, there was, you know, money you couldnt really afford-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"-'cause you owe your mom and dad some money, and they weren't bailing you out anymore, and you had to go outside and find some"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Yeah? Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Thats it. That. So, it seems like almost, like, you still have some issues, you know, still creating some problems?"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
Yeah? Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Some feelings when you, kinda, think about that?"
"Idk but I wouldnt mind getting back on track, but disproportionate"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Not really planning on spending my life in debt. [chuckles]
Mm. the mf.
"I dont mind traveling and, you know, I got friends that are saving for the [unintelligible 00:18:27] and I am 25 and working in retail"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-so I wont be doing any travelling any time soon
"okay. ok. ok. So, again, that, sort of, sounds important. So, what's-what's your dreams. What are your dreams. Where do you wanna be in 5 years. Where is Catherine. What do you wanna be doing. What are your dreams?"
I may have to travel and find this man of my dreams. [chuckles]
"Yeah, yeah."
I'm not sure. Kids maybe but-
okay. ok. ok.
"-I don't want to- [sighs] I don't want to make a decent mom the way I do, at the moment, am I. So I probably need to get on track at some point. [chuckles] I'll push 30 and still be in debt, at this rate, I'll be a"
"okay. ok. ok. ok. So, it seems like you-you are, kinda, in a state in your life of considering your next steps."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Yeah? Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. ""Do I continue with the, you know, my little current lifestyle,"" and you are so much the party girl you used to be--"
[chuckles]
"-wasn't that--wasn't that--. Yeah? Oh yeah. So, ""Do I live a party lifestyle-- party-girl kind of lifestyle, or am I getting other dreams to follow?"". So, they are hard calls. And-and there are no three ways. At some point we're gonna have to make those calls"
Mm. the mf.
"And, my sense, is that some of the challenge for you, at the moment,. Yeah? Oh yeah?"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"When you think 5 years ahead, which-which position do you wanna be in. Which-which feels best. Party girl still you know, with those 4 credit cards maxed out major, or would you rather, you know, have traveled and,. Which-which direction feels best for you at this point?"
"Party girl at 30s is a bit sad, really isnt it. [chuckles]"
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure. It's been fun up to this point-
Whats your hunch. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"-but i really do wanna travel so, so, so so so so"
"Yeah, yeah. Where in particular. You got any ideas on what constitutes"
"Um, Egypt, always been, yeah."
Egypt? More like Egypt
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Uh, what is this about Egypt, that, uh,"
"Oh, just thinking this is just fascinating"
Yeah? Oh yeah?
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Just the, um, outlook, and the culture and the history and-"
Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh
-somewhere I always wanted to be.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Not the safest place at the moment, mind you, but [chuckles]"
Nah that's true
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
But for obvious times.
Yep. Thats it. That
This could be very different.
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, so youve been--how long did you have this-this idea for that is where you would like and that"
"oh, early teens since i was young"
"Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah? Oh"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Mm. the mf. So how much is the kind of, uh, current lifestyle rob you of that, you know, take away from that dream?"
"Yeah, well, I suppose with the amount of money Ive spent over the last 5 years I probably could have gone to Egypt and back 5. [chuckles]"
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Well, yeah."
Mm. the mf.
"There you go. So some decisions are made around, uh, which dream, which path you wanna follow."
Mm. the mf.
Hmm. Interesting. What do you reckon to be the-hardest bit of taking that pathway to-travel and realize the-dream. What would you have to do to be tough enough to get through the day?
"Some friendships I believe then cut off. Um, 'cause since you see that, you know, part of their lifestyle."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That will be a huge change.
"Mm-hmm mm-hmm. So this is- this is something you thought of for a while-. So how far away you think you are from that change. You know, 'cause obviously it can- can- can- can- can- can- can- can- can- can- can- can- can- can- can-"
"Seems like a bit of unrealistic dream. Um, and I wouldnt mind taking the first step but, uh, that would be easy."
Nah. No. No. No. Thatll be easy. So what is your first step?
"Probably, um, [chuckles] cutting up credit cards for a starter, and trying to restrain myself, and not be led into temptation,"
okay. ok. ok.
"Just know if the pokies are at the pubs, just dont go to the pub. [chuckles]"
"Yeah, it's hard, isn't it. Its hard being in the pub thing, in that environment."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"We would-we would-we would-we would-we would-we would-we would-we. We call those high risk situations. Well, that's that--so you might learn some language about some sort of the way that we describe-"
Mm. the mf. [chuckles]
"being at the pub, you know, wanting to sort out the buzz of, you know, gambling, you. Yeah? Oh yeah?"
Mm. the mf.
Yeah? Oh yeah. So how today have you sorted out some ways to manage that?
"Um, I havent managed this to-to-this-point, so [chuckles] I don't know."
Mm. the mf.
"Um, I suppose I just got tougher with myself."
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. -- yeah, people often say that, but, you know, it's not-- I think some things that you can do, and you've already-al"
What? What? What? What. Cutting off some of my friendships?
"Well, this is a few ideas. O-one, thinking about who your friends are and will your friends support you to realize your dream of traveling to Egypt."
Mm. the mf.
"Um, and the other idea you were talking about before was, actually, cutting up your credit cards. So kind of amazing what that thing makes there on different cards isnt it?"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Very helpful and healthy. So, yeah, a few really good ideas already you got, guess so?"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So that's-that some work that we can continue to work with. Yeah? Oh yeah. Yeah? Oh yeah?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"So 'cause-'cause I asked the question before, is what might be the hardest thing, and you identified that your friends, you"
Mm. the mf.
"Yep. Yep. Yep. Y. Could that mean that some of your friends are probably moving around some similar sort of stuff like you, wondering ab"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"-what they want to further their dreams, yeah?"
Mm. the mf. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Okay, so we've been talking about sort of where things you-w-- Where you might be in 5 years and which path y. And you seemed very clear"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Yeah, yeah. Something we can- we can do over the next while is-is really get some very concrete things in place to support you to"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So what is one thing you can do between now and the next time we meet?
Find the scissors. [Laughs]
"Yeah, find the scissors."
Cut out the girls.
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"Then, um, I'm not sure if the debts are still there or not but I-I-I-I-I-I-I-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-a way to pay them off and-
Truly. A. Whole. Time
-I'm not sure how I'm gonna do that
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Ok, so sounds like so-some budget to buy stuff will be helpful."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Yeah, and of the things that-that we often put people in touch with here is some budget advice service, it's a"
Mm. the mf.
So lets talk about how we can organize a-a meeting with them.
"Mm-hmm, that'll be good."
okay. ok. ok.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
What else brought you here?
Found this lil bag of weed.
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
Not much though
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
I was about to sell this or something but this is a different situation. It's likephalography
Just enough for your own use?
"Yeah whatever, you know. Its California, no one cares."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
How long is this gonna last
"Yeah, we-- You know, we have about 15 to 20 minutes to talk today, total. Um-um, which surely it is just the first of- some sessions that we will have together over the next 6 months. It would be a natural question youd wanna know how much time this will take, of course. Um, what else would you like me to know about you and your perspective that you think will help me work with you over this time?"
"Im just trying to get whatever I need to get through, done."
okay. ok. ok. You focus more on what you need to get this behind you?
Yeah
". Okay mm-hmm. I was wondering if it was okay to have you and-and I have a form that we can use if you'd like, um, just to put out some different. Would-would this feel natural to-to-move towards figuring out where we might be going together?"
"So, you got this dream by the sounds of it, which is, having a partner, and a house, and a"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"-so dont forget the nice car, and some kids, and be a- be a good dad-"
"Yeah, yeah."
"-to your kids. So, is this dream starting to-- I am getting a picture of?"
"Yeah, that would be good."
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. okay. ok. ok. So, what I really want to know is how offending fits in with that picture, that dream."
I guess thats not it
"Yeah, how does this fit, Billy?"
"Uh, I guess I gotta keep coming- back here and going into court and stuff."
Yeah? Oh yeah?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Things are kinda messes.
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That dream kinda messes up that picture, huh?"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Makes it harder.
"Mm. the mf. Makes it harder. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, it can make it harder to keep a job, aye?"
Mm. the mf.
And harder to Goldbergize
"Like it's hard to get a job 'cause you gotta say that you've been in jail and stuff, so it's pretty"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
And we talked about that idea of you getting a job and something to do with cars 'cause that's where your passion is
Mm. the mf.
"Yeah? Oh yeah. So, uh, since we last met, about what you might do about getting that kind of job?"
"Uh, I'm not sure if-if I'd go into polytech, done courses there or something."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like, if they had jobs now."
"Okay, so you know some people?"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
You went down that road of going back to school in some ways and getting a tryout or-
"Yeah, yeah."
-getting qualifications?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Yeah? Oh yeah. So, what-what would interest you in going down that same, sort of, path?"
"Just learn more about cars and just, kinda, hands on work."
"Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. Yeah, so what in particular. Like, if you could have whatever you want, in terms of that sort of work, what would you do?"
"[sighs] Mechanic, or panel [unintelligible 00:18:02], or just-- I wouldnt care, I just-- as long as it's cars."
"Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. So, as long as it has to do with cars, you'd be sweet with that?"
"Yes, pretty much."
Yeah? Oh yeah?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
okay. ok. ok. So-so what sort of things do you think you need to do to get that qualification?
"Just gotta get that training, I guess, and then probably get a job."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"okay. ok. ok. So, what sort of training did you--did these people, that you have been talking about, do?"
"Like, sort of, just at polytech. Idk exactly butphalic"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"They took them like-- And, it took them like a year or so, and then they went into apprenticeship."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, how confident are you that you could do something similar to these-these friends that you have?"
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Pretty easy to do, I could do it. Its just, like, I probably know all this stuff already"
"okay. ok. ok. So, it would be pretty easy. So, if it was pretty easy, what do you need next, Billy?"
"I went outside and picked some forms and stuff, but it's real confusing, like, having to apply, so. Couldnt do this."
"okay. ok. ok. So, you actually went to polytech Cynthia"
"Yeah, yeah."
-and picked up some forms?
"Yeah, yeah. Passed around and everything."
Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"That's fantastic, Billy."
"Yeah, but I just-- Like, they wouldn't help me out, so-"
okay. ok. ok.
-Got some forms and-
Tell me- tell me what happened when you say they- like it didnt help you. What-what-what happened?
"I've been asked- I've been asked what I have to do, and they said I need to fill out some forms, but-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"-well, the forms, it's too confusing"
"okay. ok. ok. So, they gave you a horde of forms for a particular course?"
"Yeah, yeah. Well, I got one- I got one for panel [unintelligible 00:19:33], and one for, uh, panel and paint-"
Mm. the mf.
"-so, learning how to paint cars and stuff."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"okay. ok. ok. So, you got the forms, took them- took them home?"
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I was about to fill them out there but then I didnt get them, so I took them home but I just didnt get around to it"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. Did you say the forms are confusing?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah? Oh yeah. What-what is this confusing bit?
"I didnt understand, like, what you have to write down. Like, yeah. I am not good at this, maybe too confusing"
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, how did you get to this point? How did you get to this point? How did you have to write things or fill out forms"
Im not really dealing with this. I'm not a big fan of writing. I s--
You're not a fan of writing?
No. No no no no no
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, wondering what that means, about not actually liking writing."
Nah I'm just real messy so people can't read it
People can't read-- People can't read your handwriting?
"[chuckles] yeah, no. Its what they say, yeah."
"Oh, you must be a doctor."
"Yeah, I am. [chuckles]"
Yeah? Oh yeah. [chuckles] yeah?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"okay. ok. ok. So, you need some help filling out your forms?"
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like, a computer or something. I could do that if you could write on a computer"
Mm. the mf.
"But, we're not computer."
"okay. ok. ok. Okay, so what- do you need to do, Billy, to actually get to that point where you can fill out a form and post it"
Just ask to get someone else to do it I guess. I guess I could have asked Donna but this was embarrassing
"Okay, so you feel that asking Donna to help you out-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-because you feel that she might find out something about you that you don't quite want her to find out?
"Well, I'm not sure if this is that serious, this is just-"
okay. ok. ok.
"-I think most people can fill them out. I'm not sure, I just don't get it."
"Hmm. Interesting. So, who else could you ask to help you?"
No one. Literally no one. I guess you. You could do this. Would you do this?
"Well, have you got the forms with you?"
No. No no no no no
"okay. ok. ok. I wonder about-- because it sounds like this whole idea about filling out the forms, is getting in the way of this bigger dream that you"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"-and getting on this road where you stay out of trouble because you got this, um, interest-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"-which you can do. So, it seems a real shame that the forms get in the way, so we need to find a way around the forms."
Mm. the mf.
"Yeah? Oh yeah. So, what are you thinking, between now and next week, can you do around the forms?"
"I guess, I could go pick them up and I dont know, I could probably ask Donna but she would probably help"
She would probably help you but you dont really want to. Sounds like you are a bit embarrassed
"Well, I'm not sure. Plus, well, I'm not sure I could bother getting up at 9 o'clock every morning and having to go to Polytec. Ive gotten used to sleeping in"
Mm. the mf.
Late night. At night.
"So, the whole thing about going back to poly-- going back to school-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"-going back to polytech is--would- require a really big change in the way which you currently live, and you can't"
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, it would be cool if it was anything like school. I didnt enjoy school like, really. [unintelligible 00:22:56] so writing and stuff, and I wouldnt wanna do that. If it was all hands on though, it would be all good."
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, here's something to add to your level of--about how confident you are around writing or how unconfident you are, that sounds"
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Nah, it gets in the way. Im just not gonna do this"
Mm. the mf. okay. ok. ok.
This is a waste of time.
"Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. So, sounds like we might need to have some more conversations around that."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"So, whats really getting in the way?"
For what? For what? For what
"Well, this writing business. What is really getting to the point?"
"Of what? Of what? Of what. Well, I'm not getting this."
"Well, I wonder, like-- it sounds like it's a thing that you put up as saying you can't-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Cant. Can. Not. Have.
-so I'm wondering where you are around your writing and you're reading?
"Oh, it's pretty [unintelligible 00:23:47], but, like, still-- I don't know, I'm not retarded, or anything. I'm able to write and read."
Mm. the mf.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I must say, I think it's really obvious that you're not retarded."
Like--
[chuckles]
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Yea, we have a really good conversation here"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"So, reading and writing isnt a strong point for you."
"Nah, not really. Yeah, I'm not really enjoying it."
Mm. the mf.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"So, how much reading and writing is involved in a course that you go on?"
"I'm not sure. Hopefully not many-- not much, but that's what I wanna find out, I guess."
"So, what would it have been like if you were more confident in your reading and writing. What would that have been like?"
This would make everything easier.
Mm. the mf.
"Like-- I'm not really a big fan of reading books or anything, so I don't really care about that but just, say, real-life stuff like go"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"-Yeah, that have filled out forms."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"And, I guess, there will be manuals and stuff like that on-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Your course that you are confident around doing, but it sounds like the more reading, writing, book, kind of,"
"Yeah, never thought of that."
Mm. the mf.
"Yeah, that would suck if you had to read, like, a big manual or something. Hmm. Interesting."
Mm. the mf. okay. ok. ok. So- so like before you get to here where you got this dream and some things that need to happen before that
Mm. the mf.
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, mm, we need to think about what is the very first step."
So you hate this?
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I-I'm just-- I can't shoplift anymore. You know, I got- got- caught again. And uh, you know, I-I got suspended, got back to school, so I-I'm-I'm-I'm-going-to-mess-up-my-whole-life here, unless I"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Yeah, that's bad. My friends and I, just-- I mean, its fun and uh-- so I dont know what to do but I- but I-"
okay. ok. ok.
I want this. I want this. I
"So, sounds like you're ready. You guys are ready to give up on this one."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"But, maybe the path to doing that isn't so clear."
"Right. Right. Right. idk what ima do, got some friends that do. These guys are-- they are bad news, but they are my friends."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"And, uh, and it's fun."
And its fun.
You know? You know.
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Nothing-nothing much else going on that's as fun as this. We're going in, stealing these CDs. Working out fine, but disproportionate"
Uh-huh. Uhhhh.
"Thanks for coming out today. I guess you, uh, sat in that seat with a lot of people like me in the past."
Mm. the mf.
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And some of you have some ideas about that and some experiences about that. good for us to talk abt that and, um, I really wanna know what you thought about in terms of what you may"
"Right. Right. Right. Neat. So. Much. What, um, what have I changed, what am I compelled to change"
"What yall been thinking about, um, over the past little while about getting yall life back on track. 'Cause I noticed youemed to equate"
I thought it would be easy to deal with P again.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"I mean, I thought I could actually set myself up the right way doing it the wrong way."
Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure. So what I pick up is-is that-is that-is that a life that you know a lot about.
Mm. the mf.
"And make lots of money and set yourself up for success. What's the other side, because I guess when I talk to guys like myself who have done time, often they think about actually, mm. So I wonder where-where you are with the thinking about Cynthia type of thinking"
"Well, at the end of, that last week inside, I was- I had that kind of, oh, what's next buzz. And, yall, just not working out here."
okay. ok. ok.
"I'm not a, uh, uh, I don't know what that is."
Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure. So life on the outside is pretty different than the kind of-
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes
-the inside something of life?
"Yeah, it's worse."
Yeah? Oh yeah?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
So tell me how you managed. 'Cause I'm not sure if you'd been back dealing. How did you manage to-to-to Goldberg ratio
"I havent yet, I mean-"
okay. ok. ok.
"-the, uh, offer"
Yeah? Oh yeah?
"Um, I'm not sure why I haven't said that I'll still do so but I mean-"
"Uh, tell me-"
-it's there.
It's there and-and- you have a lot of contacts?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
You were in the system so lots of context. So this isnt a new challenge
No. No no no no no
So what stopped you over the last-- How long have you been out now?
How long did I go out?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Three weeks. One day.
"3 weeks, isnt it?"
Three weeks. One day.
So what was there. What is it about that you havent done in 3 weeks one day?
I'm not sure.
22 days you actually made a decision not to- pick up your old life and continue on.
"Um, I kinda told myself not to, you know, just before I left, I-. And then I just kinda with it and dont quite know why. [clears throat] I dunno, if, uh, there's no real reason why I haven't yet. I just dont think itll work the way I always dream itll you know, I see myself up like, whatever, if I do that again. Real long one."
okay. ok. ok.
And I-I can't go back there. There's no way I'm back there
"Right. Right. Right. So the one hand you-you could sit yourself up and-take the risk, but on the other hand, you know, that actually might not last?"
"Nah, never last."
Never lasts. Mm. the mf. I feel like youre a bit of a crossroads
Yep. Thats it. That. 12 years of crossroads
Mm. the mf. But those crossroads would be more focused than other times.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And- [crosstalk]
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And it sounds like maybe like-
"-sort of opposite, yeah."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"We are in the middle, you know, and it's actually at the moment, I guess."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"But I dont know. You know, quite clearly, that's quite clear. No fucking idea."
okay. ok. ok. okay. ok. ok. Sophalous
Got an idea?
"No. No no no no no. Well, I have lots of ideas but I really want to hear your ideas kind of first though because you know, and th"
Mm. the mf.
"But I guess what I really want is-is you made a commitment 22 days, drug free. Haven't gone back into that lifestyle. What-what's keeping you, cuz you're at the crossroads, you kinda just pause there at the moment. I dont know about this other bit over here. What keeping you in that place?"
Fiona? Fiona? Fiona
Yeah? Oh yeah?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Tell me about Fiona?
"She told me that if I did this, it would be over. I mean, I mean, she-- What tell you about, Fiona I mean she's been with me for a long time. She was the one that stayed through all the shit. And I owe her-"
okay. ok. ok.
-something. to.
okay. ok. ok. So youve been with Fiona for how long?
12 years. 12 years. 12 years
"12 years. 12 years. 12 years. okay. ok. ok. So she stood by you then for the time, [crosstalk] but this time she said, it happens again I'm out of here?"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. She actually got the black and white line down now
okay. ok. ok. And it sounds like you listen to that black and white line.
"She could be pretty she- you know, she could be pretty full on"
"Yeah, yeah."
"Yeah, so hard to ignore that line."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"I mean. I mean. I mean. And it comes with a whole lot of different rules, and you know, she never quite fit"
"okay. ok. ok. So something changed in your relationship, yeah?"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm thinking she has. I'm not convinced.
okay. ok. ok. So what is Fiona want from you
"She's just trying to get me. I mean, she just wants someone to be there. My. Ex. Ex. Ex. She-she remembers me and wants-she wants him."
"She wants him. She wants him. So which one does she want, Daryl?"
"The one that, you know cardiovascular factor"
Is she trying to get the- did she want the- the- the- the- the- the- the- the- the- the
"Yeah, that's the one."
Or does she want the-the-the-him that-that-keeps-getting-in-disorder?
"Nah. No. No. No. No one would want him. I'm not interested. I'm not. He's a fuckwit, isn't he. She wants the one that fell in love with her"
okay. ok. ok.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
So what is it gonna take to reclaim this Daryl that she fell in love with?
I wouldnt need to be sitting here if I had the answer to that
"Sure, yeah."
"And I mean, I'm honest- I'm not sure, man. I'm not sure. I-I wish I knew somewhere I could start that, you know, could give it to her, but I-. I-I'm not sure."
"Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. Well, let's-let's just play with this idea a bit, Daryl. So what did Fiona fall in love with. What were Daryl's qualities that she said, ""This is him""?"
"I've been pretty romantic. I mean, I was pretty smooth, and, um, you know, I was on top of my game, like, she- and she loved it. And we used to laugh in the [unintelligible 00:06:45], you know. And just- it was always so sweet, and people used to say, ""Oh, man, you two. You two just got it,"" you know. And we lost it so whatever that was, that's what she wants. We were so young. How do you become young. Uh, you know, I'm old, and we'll keep growing old, but you know?"
I know. I know.
Like if I don't take care of myself
"Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure. Everyone will get older, but that will happen on time."
Definitely. Definitely.
"Um but that's okay. So-so this is the sense of fun, the sense of Daryl, and things have changed, but she still with you?"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah? Oh yeah?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And you still with her?
Yep. Yep. Yep. Y
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So catch me up with the conversations youve had with Fiona about this crossroads youre at. Yall know these 22 days, yall havent gone back, yall are coming out and yall arent back yet. This deal could have been picked up quite easily and probably some workout here tomorrow and get back into it"
"You know what? You know what. She hasnt even broach that subject yet, like, she wont broach that subject. Thats how black and white she is. She- she will- offers suggestions, you know. What I could do, and- or I kind of go with that, but none of them are-- You know, its lovely that she. -- Ive started kinda placating her and making it ok to keep giving me suggestions but like, I need to come up with something"
"okay. ok. ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. So-so back together things are starting to get tense at home, and your relationship a lil bit?"
"A bit that. A bit that. Yea, little-little tense. Yeah, that's fair."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Dont put words in my mouth. I agree if that ratio is favorable
Nah they are.
"Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah? Oh. Yeah? Oh yeah?"
"I mean, not like theyve been because weve only just started on the new road but I mean, tense is the right word"
"Second, I'd like to talk, Daryl, about this all-whole idea, that's this crossroads idea, yep. 12 year history of being in the other system and doing some time and being away from Fiona but youre back, sitting back together. So, in that 'where to go' where this-this Daryl, non-dealing [crosstalk] guy Kanti,"
"Well, I'm not sure. Havent got little, um, nuggets of where I could go yet. I just got this feeling that I should go somewhere"
okay. ok. ok. Yep. Thats it. That. So a part of you knows you need to go something different but the direction doesn't seem to be that clear at the moment?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
It [unintelligible 00:09:33] picking up?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No idea. No idea.
"No idea. No idea. okay. ok. ok. So I wonder, you been in the system for a while. You're 34 now, is that right from the pick-up?"
[nods].
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, guys, often at 34, yall start thinking about being with a girl in their life and whats important. And-and you'd also be part of the group, so they'd actually make some shifts and change and thought,"
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, umphalic"
And now you have Cynthia
Not many. Not many.
Not many? Not many? Not many
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
But some. Some. Some.
"Um oh I got. Yeah, one. One. [chuckles]"
One? One? One? One
One. One. Only.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Mm, yeah."
Yeah? Oh yeah?
"Oklahoma on the other hand, umphal"
Say something about that
"Well, he-he was-he was-he was-he was-he was-he was-he was-he was-he was-he was"
okay. ok. ok.
"So, he did. He did."
Did he do this? Did he do this
"I dont know how the fuck he did that, but, cuz he wasnt even a real addict, he was just--. He is very good with people."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Really good at talking, and, uh, but anyway, I don't know how he did that."
"Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. So how interested would you be to find out more about how he did this. 'Cause I feel like this is someone you know, youve done time with, got a relationship."
Yeah but I cant ever be a drug counselor
"No, I don't suggest you-- No, not about being a drug counselor, but about he made that transition from-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-to a transition about being in a different place.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think he would have found some higher power. They're going to find-- I can't find one of them.
"Okay, no 12-step higher power idea?"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"So that might work for him, but what might work for you?"
I'm not sure. This is why I'm here.
Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure
I'm not sure what that is.
"Ok, so part of being here with me, and the work we might do, will be to find- try and find-"
okay. ok. ok.
-thing. Whatever it is.
Good luck. Best of luck.
"Well, that's a search, isn't it?"
"Yeah, not rude-"
No. No no no no no
-but i do mean it's a huge ask
"Yep, that's a big ask. So what qualities would you need to have to-to go there?"
Fucking guts. Fucking guts.
Guts? Guts? Guts. Yeah? Oh yeah?
Is this quality?
This is what I think.
"Yeah, I'd need some of those."
"Yeah? Oh yeah. So you're the sort of guy, Daryl, with guts?"
Am I? Am I? Am I
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Nope. Not yet.
Not yet? Not yet? Not yet
"Well, no I am not."
Yeah? Oh yeah?
"Nah, I'm not that-that-that brave. _()_/"
Yet you sat here with me today-
"Oh, gotta do."
-and-and- you talkin bout stuff.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Well, you're sitting here, and you're talking to me-"
"Oh, okay. That's okay."
-about stuff that's-that's quite deep-
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"-in a way. Um, that takes guts. Thats taking courage."
Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok.
"In my opinion, it does."
okay. ok. ok.
'Cause you couldve come in here and said-
This is awkward.
"""Look Ken, you know, I'll come in, report in, I'm outta here."""
"Ah, yeah. Thats it. That. Couldve done that"
"You could have done that but you didn't. So I wonder what's different. 'Cause you may have done that in the past, I dunno, Daryl, with other people like me, but-but-sounds-a"
"I'm older, you know. Not as fun as it used to be."
Yeah? Oh yeah?
Used to take the piss outta yall-
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"-all day long. We're all doing, but-"
Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure
"-this isnt funny. I mean, and you- you are a good guy, I imagine. Honestly, you dont deserve my shit. I'm just-- I don't know. Good luck. Best of luck."
"When you have to sort out this kind of thought process, I kinda see a sense of sadness there."
"Oh, sadness. I'm not wallowing, you know. You know, you gotta take, you know-- You make your own opportunity in life, don't you?"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
I'm just never doing this.
"okay. ok. ok. So I have a good idea, lets, uh, Opportunities come and go all the time."
Are they? Are they?
They're doing. That's what they
Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. Not to me. Not to you.
Well you said before you had an opportunity to pick up and start dealing again.
"Lol. Yeah. Oh, heaps of those opportunities."
"And-so-so-so there are opportunities- there are opportunities in one world, and I wonder what might make it hard to see"
"Yeah, well, the different world isn't giving me opportunities. The different world offers me a night shift, and minimum wage, and, you know, nothing. So, like, set yourself up, set goals, or, um, don't, and that's your, old behaviors."
"Sure, sure. You are in the system-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"-you arent in the system. Pick up that, where is it gonna take you?"
The system? The system? The system
"Yeah, what-what is going to happen if you start dealing again?"
"Man, I was fighting that system-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-and all that takes me back is to the- inside-
okay. ok. ok. ok.
-I mean potency
"So-So again, I-I wonder about this other world, and you say that it's not attractive at the moment."
"Well, I can't see that."
You can't se it?
"You know what, if I knew what they would look like-"
Yeah? Oh yeah?
"-I-I might, you know, buy that."
Yeah? Oh yeah. Just described how it looked like a minute ago.
Did I? Did I? Did I
 Minimum wage-
Oh yeah. Thats it. That
-night shift petrol station.
"Yeah, that's not fun at all. That doesnt look very good."
Yeah? Oh yeah?
"Yeah, that looks hard."
Yeah? Oh yeah. This is really hard.
"I know that's the right thing, uh, don't get me wrong."
Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure
"Thats gut right there, going to a job you hate, going home, cooking yet missus a meal, looking after your kids. I mean, that's-- That's what it real means, but I'm not that-- Th-those guts to do- to do what you do."
"Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure. We talked about courage before and you got the guts to talk about this stuff today, and I wonder if you actually do. I aint say pumping gas at minimum wage is where you wanna be, but-but-the guts to actually start steeping into this other world. I wonder if you do, I- I- I just- I- I- I- I- I- I"
"I-- Hmm, maybe."
"Maybe. Maybe not. You dont believe at the moment, I understand that and, umphal"
"No. No no no no no. Confess because, you know, I kinda want to be."
"Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure. Well, it's hard to me convincing you-"
Right. Right. Right.
"-'cause this is your life and this is your story, and you-you have to walk your life and I cannot walk your life for you. Im just walking my. I can walk with you on this life to try and think about--'Cause I-I-- You know, I- I- I-- You know, I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I. And I hear that with your relationship, where it takes your relationship too, [unintelligible 00:16:39] got the bottom line drawn pretty clear."
Mm. the mf.
"So this seems like what's gonna push in this direction, just tip that balance a bit to give this other world of go. Because its new, its different. It means doing stuff, a lot of stuff actually that-that's mundane."
"Its the little things, yeah, like waking up, having a cup of tea and sitting on the porch is kinda cool"
Is this kinda cool?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Not part of on the wire?
Nah yall dont get to sit outside-
No? No? No? No
-on the porch.
You're not. You're not. And who is sitting on the porch with you?
"No one. Literally no one. Its morning, its just me."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Birds, trees, yada yada."
Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. So I'm picking up this world actually has the freedom to you to be your own man?
"Mm, maybe."
Maybe? Maybe not.
"I'm not-- You know, that-that was nice. If it was full of bits like that, sure, but I mean, you know, eventually you have to go off to your"
Yeah? Oh yeah?
"-oh, pay your-your wages, I mean your-your mortgage and-and-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-it's just massive.
Yeah it is. This is. It is.
This is. It is.
"Absolutely massive. And, uh-- So, is there a challenge you are up to, to start creating some-some-some of that sort of world for Fiona. 'Cause I can hear thatphalic factor"
"I know people like me are unaccepted into that world though. You know? You know. I got-- I'm not qualified. All my mates are in Australia working awesome jobs, mining for 160K a year, you know. Just being men digging holes. Like, if I could do this, yeah, all good but fuck, Ive just come out of prison, I have no NCEA. I, uh, had one opportunity and fucked that because I can't do night shift 'cause I'm lazy. You know? You know. I think the world gives me opportunities and just doesnt need me. I think I can't do that."
"Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure. So what I hear is, you don't believe at the moment."
Nah I definitely dont believe in it
"No. No no no no no. So what would convince you to-to make that shift. Cause I hear a lot of kind of-- And in this hard, like, y-you did time and then once you got a record, the employers- you know, I. Thats-that's not easy. You can't just wonder into a job, a high paying job and go, ""pick me, pick me, pick me"". I'm aware that."
No. No no no no no
You know that.
"Yeah, I know."
"So, um--and maybe it's about small steps and first steps."
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, yeah, it's obviously, it's first steps, but I mean, what's that. What is the first step in becoming a pro-social life?"
"Well, you're trying to get a job, maybe and getting into some routine."
"I'm just knowing if I get a job that I hate, I just wont do it."
okay. ok. ok.
"I can make in an hour what I can make in a night or a week of nights. Pretty-- From where I'm from that a really-- You know, there's no decision at all, that's just like, what are you up"
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm confused at the moment because you say, ""Yeah, I could make in a night what you make in a week,"" but you ha. 22-22 days-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-and you havent done that yet. So-so tell me what that is
"Fiona just told me I wouldnt this time and then I said, ""You'll never"" this time."
"So you told yourself you wouldn't, so you're once you- you're the sort of guy that once you make a decision you go"
"Yeah, even if it's the wrong one, yes."
"Oh, it's a decision whether it's right or wrong-- It's not gonna be-"
Yeah but I'm that kinda guy
"Yeah, you're that kinda guy okay, so once you make a decision. So youve made a decision that you will not- you will not go back to dealing?"
"Oh no there wasnt a decision made, I just said, ""I wont yet"""
Yet. Still. Not. One
"Yeah, I've said yet."
You keep the door open-
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"-at the moment, is what I pick up."
Hate that. Hate that.
"Yeah, okay, so that will be a call you-you-have-to-make."
Mm. the mf.
"I-I can't- I can't make that call. You can make that call, but there are big consequences more time probably and Fiona not being around. me picking up is a call to do some- do some- do some- do some- do some- do some- do some- do some-"
"Mm, yeah."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
And still no closer.
No. No no no no no
But I mean yeah its there
But we are talking about it.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
So how much time did you have to talk about this-
Lol. Fuck. That.
-position? position? position? position
"With anyone other than Fiona. I wouldnt say for about 10 hours with you, no time at all."
"Ok-okay so the fact we even have a conversation about it, its kinda interesting?"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Yeah so I wanna summarize, Daryl, what-what I picked up so far and then just so I make sure I listen. 'Cause, you know, it's important you get your mind heard-"
Mm. the mf.
"-by people me. Is-is that if youve-youve-got this long 12-year history, you can make some big money or you can do crime, that stuff, I-"
"12, nearly 13."
"And so-so she stuck with you, and I'm pick up that's important to you, um, and-and-yet you talk abou"
Mm. the mf.
"actually thinking about, yall, doing stuff, doing the stuff that-that everybody else generally does, [unintelligible 00:22:30]"
"Uh, that-it does kinda seem exciting."
"Oh, it does?"
"It does, because it's so different."
Right. Okay.
And I kinda over that one
"Well, you're over that one,. So, let's start thinking about what might be the first step."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Yeah, with while going in, I think you got a high steep."
Okay. I. Am. Not. Okay
"Yeah, a steep, you see before you had a mate who turned his back on offending."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
And for him this 12-- You've been wondering that the 12-step stuff working for him
"Yeah- yeah, it works for him."
"I wonder the conve- the conversation with him that might be around actually how did he do it, and how did he stay without slipping back across the"
"Uh, ringing him."
Ringing him? Ringing him?
"Mm, yeah."
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You seem a bit surprised, I-I'm-I'm- [crosstalk] wondering about, surprising face."
"You- you know, it was a long time ago that we were inside. I'm just knowing that's what he's doing. It would be pretty odd to call out but the- he probably wouldnt mind"
So possibility to call?
Possibility to call yeah
Yeah there could be.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Yeah, okay, and Fiona has been pretty staunch."
Mm. the mf.
Is someone who actually who has some pretty clear ideas about where she wants you as a couple to go-
Mm. the mf.
-I'm getting a sense.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Well, just gotta do what I'm told. I'm not sure."
"Yeah but I pick up behind that doing what you tell her, she got some hopes"
"Oh yeah, I was being, um, chipping, I mean, yeah she has more hopes than me, you know."
So what will it take for you to start thinking about some of her hopes and sharing some of her hopes?
"Um, like I do- I do but what it would take, you know, I mean, that's pretty freaking terrifying shit"
Yeah? Oh yeah?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I would never admit to that.
You said before you sort of guy that once you make a decision you're pretty staunch with that decision
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Made a decision to go there, might be a scary as fuck but again this might work if see"
Yeah but my-when I made my decision to not do that yet like I was very clear I understand that picture. I kinda need to really-really know what that is if I make a decision to do this. Not only to talk I mean-
Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure
"-what is the whole plan to-call-up you know and say hey bro, hey bro, uh, how did you do that. Seriously? I mean, really. Is this cardiovascular"
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Thats-that's what I think- I think actually. Here's someone that actually made a different decision then, uh, it sounds like that's the pathway that starts over here. I wonder if you might have wisdom about what it feels like to t-to-tread that path."
"Yeah, like, I could be wondering that too."
"So you know theres a part of you going, I was thinking in this place that hard work"
Hmm. Interesting.
And this is a pretty lonely walk by myself road to-. I wonder who else might be around you that might actually walk with you?
There is Fiona.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[unintelligible 00:26:37] getting out so what-what he did. Um daddy is only as mean. There is Fiona.
Maybe they can walk that road with you too
"Yeah, okay, uh, all the same. Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok."
There are a few people.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
If you want to do that. This gotta be your call
"Um, what brings you in today?"
"I'm not sure. Bit of the trouble dealing with, uh, my criminal history and, uh, you know, trying to stay on the right track, but,. Um, I really wanna be, you know, a good productive member of society, but at the same time, you know, I got this background that. Do you know what, do I go back to what I know? It's really frustrating to work for so long,. This is causing, uh, some anger issues to resurface and some depression to resurface and, um, you know, and,"
Its really getting to you becoming who you want to be.
"Yes, it is."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So what-what-what about your criminal record blocking you from getting where you wanna be?
Umphalous I dont know
"There's a, uh, your record has a conviction?"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This has a felony conviction on it
"okay. ok. ok. Ah, there's-"
"And, uhphalous"
- the big trouble. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Yeah, it is. And it- I didn't anticipate that it would have been-- You know, so at the time, it was just like, ""Okay, cool. I will not go to jail."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Yall know and, um, now, it's like, okay, so this is more like a life sentence than it was a 4 year sentence that they. I thought it would be bad either way, but, um, I didn't anticipate that this would be this hard, especially since I went back to"
"Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. So when you, um, put in applications or anything like that, the felony con-conviction, whether you know it or not, seems to knock you out of the ballpark. You arent even considered as an applicant?"
"Nah I aint. Um, in situations where I don't know about it, I don't know about, I probably-- Um, you know, that sucks too. Dont get me wrong. I mean, I- I'm not- I'm not getting callbacks a lot because of that issue-"
Mm-hmm mm-hmm.
"- I think so. are-are-are-are-are-are-are-are-are-are-are-are-are-are-are-are-are-are-are-are-are-are-are-are-are-are. And, you know, most of the time, I interview extremely well. I get the vibe that the job is offered almost halfway through the interview because, you know, they start telling me about. Its just-its almost like night and day"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Black and white. Just stops right there. ""I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I. I'm not really good at all. I-- You have to go,"" you know, and it constitutes"
"So do you- do you, um, put out there about felony convictions before you even go for the interview?"
"No. No no no no no. I mean, there are different situations, you know. Sometimes they ask and, you know, I'll say something like, you know, ""We'll be discussing at the interview"". Uh, sometimes, there are situations where if I probably put that, I dont get a callback and those. times where i get an interview through, um, you know, uh, you know, some sort of connection or something, or like a b. I'm not the only one who needs to fill out that- fill out an application for that. They're just usually, y'know, giving you the interview. And at the end-"
Seems like a done deal.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Sounds like a done deal. Just go through the motions of having the interview. And then-
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"The interview went well, and they were like, ""Okay, well, can we do something"" and then, ""Here, sign this, sign that"". And it's like, but we just had a great, you know, I qualify. Like what does that have to do with anything-- Seven years ago, 6 years ago, what does it have to do with anything. Now, especially because, you know, the type of conviction, it wasn't a non- it was a violent convi. I don't feel like I'm a danger to the staff around me. It's not like it's a, y'all know, a stealing type thing. It was, yall, a possession, yall know what I mean?"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
And
So you didnt hurt nobody
"Nah, I didnt."
"Youve not been hurt yet, right?"
It's really frustrating because-
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"-it's almost like I-I'm not giving up, but it's almost like, I don't have any other choice, you know?"
"Yeah, 'cause you're-you're, especially with going back to school and having done all that footwork and stuff. I mean, you really have something to offer somebody."
"Yeah, I'm doing, yeah."
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um and at the time the big crisis was actually maybe prison and all the crisis around the arrest and, uh, you know, it's like you a"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Um, have you ever started the interview with that conversation so that you don't even have to go through the whole thing and"
"Not that I can think of, no."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
I'm thinking differentiation
What would you do if you did this?
Probably get booted out right away-
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
-you know? -you know. Umphaloid
"Woulda been, um, what would they be like vs getting through this great interview, knowing you're-you're-you-good for the"
"Well, it's-it sucks either way. You know what I mean?"
"Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. It's, uh, I mean the lesser of two evils is that what we get at-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
-you know what I mean. If-if you mean if that's what you're trying to say is if that's something that I could do and then if they
"Right. Right. Right. I wonder if then really the interview is really something else if that dealbreaker and you both. I mean, whether they get the job would truly be based on the interview and not-not your criminal record."
"I mean, maybe efficiency, you know, weeding out the things, not wasting my time, you know, but"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"-arent the sort of jobs that I really want to be doing. You know what I mean. Um, I'm not sure, it's just really frustrating."
"Not like you work for the government or for a bank or, you know, the FBI where- those are not things you. They are jobs where you would wonder why a-a non violent felony would even--"
Be an issue. Be a problem.
Right. Right. Right.
"Right, and then the other thing is anybody that I might tell that to-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
-that doesnt care-
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"-are probably not jobs that, you know, are worth going to get the interview."
"Mm-hmm, didnt go to college for that one."
Right. Right. Right.
Mm. the mf.
"Do you know what I mean. I tell them I have a felony conviction, just so you know before the interview and they dont really mind. I mean, that's awesome, but at the same time, I'm not- I'm not looking to be a mover or-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"-a burger flipper or something like that. Not that there's anything wrong with this, but I feel like I have a bit more to offer-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"-you know, and, um, I don't know, it's a really, it's-it's like being caught between a rock and a hard place."
"Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. So, what have you looked into, um, you know, advocacy in that area or expungement or anything like that?"
"After all the reading I have done on this situation, I have, you know, just became mush"
What did you find out?
"Found out that I have the type of, um, felony that expungable, I'm not even the type that's sealable. I apparently the type that has to go on the governor's desk next to death row, you know, inmates or the candidates for, um, a. I-- Thats what it all boils down to is that I have a class one felony-"
Uh-huh. Uhhhh.
"if you know, options, the only option I have is for, um, governor clemency and I can't figure out why because it"
"I-I didnt know that. So I, you know, know a bit about that, um, and not, yeah. So that's-that interesting. Oh, what about advocacy groups?"
"I looked into, um, a fe- um, I looked into a few groups that are supposedly helping convicted felons get-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
-work. at. all. time
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Um, again, the- only-- I mean, I think what I saw was a whole bunch of, y'know, dead end jobs."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"And the other thing that I saw was that it was very politically charged. I didnt think that, um, I was, uh, you know, allowed to sort out an interview right away with one of those coun. Um, I-- it just didn't seem like a type of place that was willing to help, you know. And-and, uh, I've seen that there's a lot of, um, I wouldn't say racism but I'd say some racial favor. And, uh, I found this really hard to get in and to get an interview with a counselor to match me up with a job. Um, I think those-those types of groups are cool if they work. I've just had no luck with, um- at working with- through that group."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
You know? You know.
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Um, you know, I'm not sure. I'm not sure if there's another one out there"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. So you- you're Middle Eastern. So you wonder-- I-I bet you have had experiences where you really have experience of some absolute racism and prejudice because of that
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"And then, um, you walk into these places and they might just be almost storefront-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
-type places. And the job market is terrible.
"Right. Right. Right. It's-it's, uh, there's a lot stacked up against me."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
Lets just put it like that
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"But uh, that doesnt equate"
What are you going for?
"Well, that's what-- yeah. Thats-- I mean, uh, I can, um, carry a conversation."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
So at some point I'd imagine that maybe I'm striking up conversation with the right person-
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"-that would probably want to hire me regardless of that sort of thing. Um, I think that at this point in time, that doesnt really matter what degree you have. I'm not believing that it matters where you went to school. It all depends on who you know. I think that's why I'm. We live in a very politically charged city, you know. Even at this point, jobs are so scarce that people who know people who know people who end up, um, at work-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"-and getting jobs. And I think that, um, if I continue to, you know, go to school and, uh, get time from that felony, you. So seven years later and differentiation"
It's long over.
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And at some point, I probably dont even have to report it, you know, and I have that going for me. 7 years. 7 more to go. I'm, y'all, uh, good at, uh, interacting with people, that's good."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"I mean, um, I've been clean from that sort of lifestyle for that long so that's-that-that up for me, you know, that's-that. Umphaloid"
And you can- you can prove that and document that.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Some folks can't.
They're not.
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And you went to school. I mean, all-all your movement is in this really positive, highly motivated way. I think your- your thoughts and ideas about the fact that one day a conversation will- you'll strike up with somebody wh"
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's my hope."
It's individual. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Thats my hope.
It-it's individual.
This is. It is. Should be. Should be. You know I-' Iphalous
It-- I believe it is.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"There is no-- I dont think, any State or Federal law that says."
Nah. No. No. No. It's an individual but you're right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Itrogenically relate
okay. ok. ok.
But here it is Corinthians 68:26 comparing the
"Right person, right company-"
Right. Right. Right.
-we want to see you there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"A lot of companies blindly implemented, you know, those types of situa- and there's no- there's no-. I mean, there are a lot of situations where people's reports are not even accurate about their criminal background."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
I'm thinking that-
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Blindly, people have implemented those types of, um, measures and have no efficiency with them because. And I- that's one of the things that makes me afraid of is that people are implementing all these safety measures,"
Wonder what it would be like if you ran your own background check and got the report to see what's in there
I'm still waiting for this. I
"Oh, you're doing that?"
"Yeah, I'm doing that. I'm one and, uh, um."
Good for you doing that
"Right, yeah."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Smart. Smart. Smart.
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. You are welcome. I'm not sure. I just, I guess-"
Disappointed. Disappointed. Disappointed.
-what I really Categories
"Disappointed, yeah."
"Yeah, I'm really here because I think I'm- I- I- It's a very dangerous area for me when I'm discouraged because-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
-the only thing that makes me loud and clear is the things that I'm not going for me.
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
If that makes any sense.
"Uh, yeah, it does. -I feel like just in this time we've been talking together that you, um, um, do have a sense that a lot of it has to-. Um, to me, if I were an employer, you know, I would- I would be impressed with that."
Thank you. You are welcome.
"Uh-- You're welcome. And- so what about, um, I know I've had a client that has told me a few things. He was doing some work on this, uh, if you- if you'd be interested I could tell you what he shared with"
"Yeah, yeah, I am."
"okay. ok. ok. Um, he found the most valid information on blogs done by felons."
"Oh, okay. That's okay."
They're your experts.
Very interesting.
"And, uh, they-they-they actually, uh, they- they- they- they- they- they- they- they- they- they- they-. For instance, family-owned businesses just tend to-- They can, if they can--"
"Yeah, again, it's like who you know, right?"
Right. Right. Right. Right.
I'm aware that-
Or start your own business. That was another thing that I thought was really--
"Yeah, well, I think that's what I got. Thats what Im doing. So, I sort of involved with now is like, find, um, you know, I'm still continuing to go to school, but I. Um, you know, it's not no Fortune 500 company or anything, but I do have a bit of income coming in from that"
Uh-huh. Uhhhh.
"Um, it-it, uh, you know, it'll all come together."
So being an entre- being an entrepreneur fits for you.
"You know what? You know what. Actually, one of the things that I read is that is one of the things that you gotta do is just, uh, start your own. You know what I mean. Uh, you're not supposed to report to anyone. Clearly I can't work with, uh, I think the law says I can't work with kids or, um, like, a hazmat stuff."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
Like truck driving and stuff like that.
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Uh but that doesnt matter to me. Yall know what I- yall know, I kinda- I'm trying to look at the things that I can do."
Now that you know a-a really different way of looking at it than how you looked at what you can do vs what's getting in your way
Right. Right. Right.
"So, um, what kinda- what- what are you starting. What is this business. I know it's on the up and up but you don't have to tell me if you don't want to"
"Nah, its, um, like, a party planning event, you know, like a wedding planner, not like a"
You would be so good at that
"Like, corporate events when they have, you know, like an event, you know, they need-"
Uh-huh. Uhhhh.
"-you know, they need chauffeured transportation, limos, they need that type of thing. I, um, I'm involved in the planning of the transportation from airports, uh, hotel arrangements, um, booking of, uh, you. I guess just an event planner, but it's not through any sort of corporate, um, company [unintelligible 00:19:40]"
You- you would be the corporate entity.
"Yea, yea, yea, I'm trying to get Cynthia"
CEO. for the win.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[laughter]
"I'm not sure about that, but, you know."
"So. Much. Fucking. Yeah, I-I've heard that-that in recession, uh, those are often the best opportunities for people to, um, see an area where you"
"Yeah, I think that's my only, uh, uh, I know that's not my only-"
One. One. Only.
"-but- it- it- it- it- it- it- it- it- it- it- it- it- it- it- it-. I'd love to just be able to work for myself, yall know that. Um. Is. That. Okay"
You comfortable with that?
"I am, comfortable with it and doing well. I'm doing well at-at, y'all, the few opportunities I've had to organize something like this. Um, it's okay. At least I'm still going to school tho, you know I'm going to finish that shit"
I know. I know. Thats fantastic. This is. It is.
"I'm not acting out, you know, I mean, I think I have-"
Acting out would be what?
"Well, you know, idk, um, going back to a lifestyle, you know, crime or, um, using, or"
okay. ok. ok. Gottcha. Thats it. That
"-and sort of destructive behavior. Im not destructive. i wanna be productive, yall."
Like you are now.
"Like I said, I mean, I wouldn't have come in here if things were just peachy keen, you know what I mean. This shit sucks. And I get so sick of, yall know, rejection and it makes me think like, why am I even going to school. You know? You know. Just, you know, get jobs that are, you know, that's not a viable option for me either. But if I'm not okay here, here, you know, I just, I don't think that I have, you know?"
"So the-the-law of, um, felony convictions is-is something that you have no control over. I mean, nobody does. I was thinking about how you were talking about getting all the way through the interview and then getting rejected, you know, versus being upfront about it"
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I've just recently got one of those where I'm going to get offered. I- he-- I think he was-- I'm pretty sure he was offering him a really good job."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"And, uh, it was an interview given to me by my brother, you know, who knew the guy. And, um, it went great until he gave me the paperwork to sign for a background check. And I said, well, I'll sign it, but I just wanna let you know that this is what you find."
"And your brother didnt know that when he gave you the job lead, that there was a background check involved?"
"Nah he did. He said, you know, dont say anything until, you know-- I dont know what he said. I think he said that he doesn't trust them."
okay. ok. ok.
"just, uh, I just, uh, figured I'd just give her a shot, but I think I like your, I think to spare myself some,"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"-I'm thinking that might be a good idea. I'll try, you know, from now on you know, uh, finding like a tactful way of asking, you know, I don't be blunt. Or anything."
You arent a criminal. You are a criminal.
I'm a former criminal though
Thats right. Thats it. That. You are rehabilitated.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
A plus shining new guy.
"Right. Right. Right. So, I know that I'm a new guy, but, uh, they don't, you know, so I think society's a lot less forgiving."
"Oh, I think so too"
"And individuals, and um, so I think I'll try-- I think that's a really good idea is to sort out, you know, but. You know. You know. How-how do you possibly tell somebody, you know, how to get that out there before you go in?"
"I guess I'd just have a tendency to say this. I am a recovering person. And back in my former life, a felony conviction. And dont waste my time before we go any further. Uh, would that be a problem in getting the interview, what would you think about saying something like that?"
"Hmm. Interesting. Seems, uh, sort of forward, you know, but I-I think that's probably better to say so I don't waste my time and"
Mm-hmm mm-hmm.
Yea. You know that. Im thinking about trying that from now on
"okay. ok. ok. I mean, if you wanna work on a few, you know, things, uh, to write down that sound comfy and fit, you. 'Cause I-I also think, interviewing is a good schoo- a good skill, and the more you do it, the better you get at it. And you got a lot of practice at it. So that's-that useful too"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"I mean, even-even tho you get turned down, that feels awful. Actual and, I bet you with every single one, you get better at it"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean the interview process-
"Uh-huh, uh-huh."
"-itself, no, never- yeah, never-. Nah I-I mean I dont believe that I have an actual interview process."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Bitch I bet you even look better now
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's been a lot.
Practice got you lots
"Been a lot, yeah."
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well then lastly, just getting back, um, to this, another source that same client was an advocate for the john"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
I'm not sure if youve ever-
I've heard of this. I havent-
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
- looked into it yet but-
"Uh, he, yeah, uh, he- they have a lot of, uh, they have a lot of really good stuff on there about this because-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"-they are so, um, prejudicial. They're really that way. I would check with the ACLU too. I mean, just as I- I dont know a lot, and now I'm very curious and I wanna find out about it myself but"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I know. I know. I-I did some research on this for school.
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"And, uh, turns out that's a big cause of recidivism rates. You know-"
"Oh, absolutely."
-as far as people going back-
Absolutely. Absolutely.
"-to what they know, and, uh, and there is prejudicial motivation, uh, and there is conflicting"
You are not allowed to vote.
This is really frustrating. I know. I know.
And you are not allowed to vote.
I'm thinking that- I think- I think ignorance is what really constitutes
Shocked to find that out.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Couldnt believe that.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Do you know how many millions of people and when you think about that racially, um, hmm"
"Exactly, exactly."
"Yeah, mm-hmm."
I know there's-there's just so much-a lot of bullshit out there.
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Thats a great word for it there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, um-"
"Yeah, to figure out [unintelligible 00:27:30] anyway, you know."
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So-so maybe you- if you- if you- could, and this is really up to you, you could check out the blogs, you. Um, I can see if I can track him down and stuff and the John Howard Society. And, um, I would be really interested if-if you wanna get together to see what you have found out."
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I-I, you know, I, you know, like I said, I wanna make sure I come back and, um, kinda get my, uh, mental"
Mm-hmm mm-hmm.
"-you know, um, I wouldn't say stable because I'm not that unstable. Justphalous"
But this has affected it.
It has affected it.
"Rejection-rejection, yeah."
"Yeah, rejection. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"So, just making sure that I'm okay. So-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"-I'll be back and we can, you know, discuss further if you have any information and I'll share whatever I"
I'll do some checking around for you. I'm going to. I'll. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Well, thanks for the suggestions. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah."
"Oh, you're welcome. Thanks for being so open with me. I'm appreciating this."
No problem. No problem.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. okay. ok. ok.
Thank you. You are welcome.
"Okay so why isnt there a rinse, David. How are you feeling?"
okay. ok. ok.
"Good. Good. Good. Good. Here, take a look, see what you think. And this feeling-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"-and the colour is okay. I know quite a lot of staining so, um, I just want to know, um, some concerns about smoking."
Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh
Possibly-
Gonna get that again
"-coffee, tea. Yeah, you heard this before, I think."
"Im doing all the above, yeah"
"Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. So, you know, the smoking is going to be related not just to some of the other negative consequences. Physical, it affects dental caries, dental cavities-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"-um, healing-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-in your mouth.
okay. ok. ok. Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure
So--
I heard it all. I-- but I just want my teeth fixed
"Yes and I really want to be a helpful person. I really want to-- yall know, my commitment is to your oral health, so um, there are tons of medications out there, David. They make quitting so much easier."
"I've been doing a pill thing so I tried this. So like, I've tried this. Just did the pills and they didnt work"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
This was a waste and caused more side effects
".No, it--but David, it's not a waste. Research shows that people take on average 7 tries before quitting smoking, so think of it as youre one step closer to quitting, so--"
Or 7 lecture along the road.
"Well, I'm not giving you a lecture, that's certainly not what I meant. I--"
"No. No no no no no. Nah I'm just feeling that way. I'm getting really-- I get very defensive about when they bring--cause I get it from my family doc, from my cardiologist,. I be like, Im not a complete idiot. I am for smoking but disproportionate"
"Well, there is-there is a reason that [crosstalk] people are concerned."
-But quitting isnt easy.
"No. No no no no no. But as I said, these medications--so you tried the medication, you were willing once"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Then, can I write you a prescription for the medication. Can we talk about how you could use this. Because this is something that-that's very important. Not just for your overall physical health, for your oral health--"
I guess I got to really want and--things Ive tried usually cause more problems than they help.
"Oh no, the smoking causes you more problems than anything else. David, I can promise you that"
okay. ok. ok.
Nothing compared to what can happen from the side effects from medication.
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Like, that's the, I think, thing to really consider."
"okay. ok. ok. Well, can I go now?"
I-- okay but you know--
"I-I-I know it, I-I know- I know, doc, what you tryna-- but I just don't wanna get into that right now"
"okay. ok. ok. Well, thanks for listening, and honestly, I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I-"
okay. ok. ok.
"Um, I'm not okay. I"
Thank you for the care. I appreciate it.
"I'm here to help, is that okay?"
okay. ok. ok.
So--
"Okay, finished the exam. Got some good news and some not so good news. Looks like you have no cavities so that's the good news"
That's awesome.
"However, I notice something I notice in your mouth. Actually, if you look up here, the roof of your mouth, I notice a lot of irritation that's really consistent with tobacco. And you said on your form that you are not a tobacco user so I just wonder what is going on"
I'm not smoking cigarettes.
"okay. ok. ok. I said, there's a lot of irritation, in particular, like I was mentioning, up here in the roof of your mouth, it's turned. I didnt notice that we spend a lot of time looking at the roof of our mouth but you are really damaging this tissue in. It's called nicotinic stomatitis. And this is something we don't see in any patients who don't use tobacco. So, maybe you don't smoke cigarettes, are you smoking a pipe or cigar. Or is there another thing that could contribute to this. Because I dont know what else might have caused this."
"-- I never smoke cigarettes ever again, um, but, um, when, um, when I go out with my friends, we like to go out to lou"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"And, um, you know, sometimes those- those, those, nice young men that gift you different sorts of things. Mini cigars, they come in peach and-and- grape and-and, you know, that's the only time that really, you know,"
"Okay, so I think that's a pretty common misconception, because they're fruit-flavored, people think they're ok. Those are really bad. Did you know that?"
"Seriously? Really? Seriously. Bad? No. Not at all. But theyre just little, mini, little, cute little girly cigars."
"Right. Right. Right. They still cigar and they still cause lung cancer, oral cancer, emphysema, all those same types that you would see with cigarette"
"Well, only use them to relax. I mean, it's not like it's something that I'd smoke 20 or 30 cigarettes a day, I mean, I only do that when we go out"
"Uh-huh. Uhhhh. Well, at least you don't do that, so that's good, but still causing a lot of problems. And as I said, I can see that the evidence in your mouth, you cause some serious damage, and this needs to. Have you thought about quitting?"
"Well, I didn't really know I'd start."
What are you talking about?
"I really thought this was anything but social drinking, just something that I do in a social setting when me and my hom"
So youre quitting then?
"Uh, maybe."
"What do you mean maybe. Just told you how bad it is. Messing up your mouth, putting yourself at risk for all these other diseases. This is so important. You're gonna need to quit."
"Well, this is something that I need to think about."
"What is there to think about. [chuckles] You said it's not that something you do all that often, and there are all these negative side effects, there"
"Well, it's just something that I do to relax, and I don't do it that often. And so I probably could cut back."
"Okay, well, that's a good start, but cutting back doesn't fix broken heart. If you actually quit smoking, you can reverse all the damage youve done in your mouth, and stop yourself from-. But as long as you continue to use these cigars you really put yourself in a lot of danger"
"Well, I'm not believing that they're cigar smokers. And what I do believe is that it is a choice and it is my right, and it is something that I choose to do. And so I'll be thinking about cutting back but I'm not at a point where I'm ready to do that. And I honestly dont believe that what you tell me is real."
"You choose to really damage your mouth and actually, it can cause problems with your teeth too. I'm not sure if yall notice your teeth might be getting yellower than they used to. Thats another side effect. There are a lot of really negative things that go along with any tobacco use, whether it's cigarettes, cigars, dip, snus. This is a really important decision that you make and you said it's your choice but you really choose to die."
"Well, this is something that will cross my mind."
"Well, I appreciate you thinking about it. I hope you think about this real hard. Yall know this is something that I will continue to ask you about because its something that really needs to change"
Good morning. Have a great day. I really appreciate that you came along to see me to talk about stopping smoking.
Good morning. Have a great day.
"What are you looking for, what are you looking for from us?"
"Well, if you can offer me some medication, I need some."
"Absolutely, we are in the right place for that."
"And, uh, whatever else you can do just to get me to go smoke-free."
"okay. ok. ok. Well, just remind me again why it is you want to stop."
"It's, uh, just these days-- I think these days I'm- I'm finding that, um, I'm smoking 20, 30 a day, I. Its, you know, Ive seen my friends stop smoking too and its kinda they look at me weird these days"
"Ah, good, and so feeling under pressure here."
"Especially the other night I was at a restaurant, it was a bit-- you know, it was cringe I'm the only one walking out"
And so that-that can't feel a bit uncomfortable being by myself. So this sounds like one of the reasons you gotta quit it's getting smelly and it's embarrassing
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
Any other reasons?
"Um, these days are expensive."
How much is a week actually worth?
"It's about-- um, I'll buy and go through a pack a day, so it's almost 7."
7 a week or 1 day?
7 a day today so-
So your pack a day gulf
-you mean 40k ugh Dionne
50 a week.
50 a week.
"Even more mess, yall see."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
okay. ok. ok. So we can talk about spending 50 a week-
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"-being one of the few left smoking in your crowd, and not liking the smell. Thats 3 reasons why."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
Think that's enough to make you say goodbye to cigarettes?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Awesome, okay. So you guys have a date in mind when you guys would like to stop smoking?"
"Well, what you do-- What do you suggest?"
"If you find time when you are not under a massive amount of other stress and strains, generally it works well."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
What are the main reasons why you actually smoke. What do you enjoy the most about it?
"Um, it's entertainment. Something, um, when I was bored, it had-- I had-- I smoke-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"-or sometimes I go outside but as I said, I'm the only outside type"
okay. ok. ok. What do you think you'll miss the most from this?
"The-- Um, it takes away a lot of my stress."
"Mm-hmm, what sort of stresses?"
"Just, uh, when I- when I- come down, uh, for- a break at work."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Im never going down, I just need a break from it all, just shut the fuck up. So, uh, I-I really enjoyed that. This cigarette just helps me calm down"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And whats your favorite cigarette of the day?
Definitely the one at the end of the evening
Okay so the end of the day-
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"-the thing that helps you just unwind, put an end to the work section and move into your own time."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
okay. ok. ok. So after youve had the quit date and its time to go home if you havent had a cig in a while?
"Um, I'll just- I'll just- I'll just- I'll just- I'll just- I'll just- I'll just- I'll just- I'll just-"
okay. ok. ok.
Thats one of those tough ones
Have you managed to stop smoking?
I managed for a few weeks
okay. ok. ok. And what got you back?
"It was, um, To be honest, stress from an argument with my partner I remember."
So something just happened-
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"-so it took you back in it. Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. Lets just make sure I understood what is going on here. Yall really wanna stop smoking because yall kinda the last guy in your group still smoking, it costs a lot of money, and"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"The main reason why you smoke is because, at the end of the day, it gives you a kind of relaxation, and if there's quite a"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
What you wouldnt mind is stopping and you wouldnt mind being able to sort out a time to quit when it. When are you going to choose to be your quit date?
"guess, um, at the weekend I got a party coming up"
okay. ok. ok.
"So, uh, maybe Monday morning."
"So Monday morning after the party ends and that's next week. okay. ok. ok. One of the things that we do in our pharmacy is recommend that you use medication to help you. Know that increasing your chances of success and making it more likely that can manage any cravings that come along. A lot of people like using nicotine replacement therapy which comes in a variety of formats like patches, gum, youve probably seen p. And other options are tablets which you can get from GP."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"So, again--Um, so, have you something in mind that you might like to use to help you through cravings?"
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I thought, um, one of these patches."
"okay. ok. ok. So a patch is something you already see, and-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"-and, again, get some out and show me what they look like. 10-12 weeks of medication with this course. And we strongly recommend that people stay on the whole course of medication and that gives you the best chance of success. You absolutely make your chances of success 4x greater than trying on your own, so, that's why it's so easy to. Now, what you said is you really want to do it and that next week sounds like a good day for you to start"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"You have the time at the end of the day when you finish work, which might be the first time you go without a cigarette. So, what I would like to recommend is that you use two products perhaps and I think you have a patch and then. A person who smokes knows exactly how it feels when they crave a cigarette. What does it feel like to you, when you cant have a cigarette and you want one?"
Im just getting irritable
okay. ok. ok.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
And thats exactly one of the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal that I want to stop happening to you.
Hmm. Interesting.
"So, I would strongly recommend that you have the patch. I will talk to you about how to use that and that we have another product that I leave you to use as when"
okay. ok. ok.
"So, happy birthday to you and your date for [unintelligible 00:06:16]?"
"Yeah, absolutely."
Okay and would you be interested to come back and see me again?
Definitely. Definitely.
And what would you guys want me to do if you guys dont come back?
Lovely phone call.
I would be very happy to do that
"I wrote a prescription for Aiden and that should help with the ear infection, but in looking through the chart, I mean,"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Thats really a problem.
"Yeah, its pretty stressful for both of us. This guy gets really upset."
"Well, one of the primary risk factors for multiple ear infections in kids is actually smoking. Are you smoking?"
"Yeah, I-- Yeah, I do smoke, but I'm not smoking around him. Im trying really hard not to smoke around him"
"Well, the fact that he has those ear infections is revealing to me that he is being exposed to smoke, and so,"
"I-I'm not sure. Im trying really hard not to smoke around him. Im not smoking in my car. Um, when he comes home, I go outside to smoke. I'm just-- I mean, I know that's bad, and I know that's bad for him, so I don't want him around it so"
"Really need you to quit smoking. Both for your health and for Aiden. Did you know s-smoking around your child could get to the point where you have to put tubes in his ears pretty soon here. Also, things like vitamin C deficiency, cavities, like dental cavities, behavior problems, um, asthma, other upper resp. He really put him at risk. Kids of smokers end up smoking themselves in addition to that. Do you want him to grow up to be a smoker?"
Nah but I dont smoke. I-- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I-
"Well, time to quit. It really has gotten to the point where you cant keep smoking. Not only for him, like I said but also for you. You put yourself at risk for lung cancer, for emphysema, for oral cancers, for heart disease, for all kinds of things-"
"I know, I know. I heard-- People have told me before, I heard all that before. I'm just not sure how to do this. How am I supposed to quit. This-this is so hard."
"Well, there are all types of things you can use now. It's not as hard as it used to be. You can use nicotine replacement.  patches are patches are lozenges are lozenges are lozenges are lozenges are lozenges are nasal spray. We can talk about medications. Try Chantix, you can try Zyban, there are quit smoking groups you can go to, there are hotlines you can call."
Im just not ready for any of that
"There's no reason you shouldn't quit, this is really important."
"I understand that. I know this is it. I mean, everybody has issues, right. It just-- It just really does. Hard."
"Well, whats more important to you than your childs health?"
I'm not sure.
I really need you to tell me that you quit smoking. This is so important.
I'll-I'll-I'll-I'll-I'll-I'll-I'll-I'll-I'll-I'll-I'll-I'll-I'll-I'll-I'll-
"okay. ok. ok. Well, I think you really need to think about this seriously. Like I said, it really puts you and your child in danger."
ok whatever. okay. ok. ok.
okay. ok. ok.
"So happy to see you today Sarah, so glad to see you in for your well-woman exam. We've addressed a lot of your concerns, I think. I would also like to ask you more about your smoking. However, I would like to. Would that be okay?"
"Yeah, I guess."
okay. ok. ok. So about how much are you smoking over the course of a day. Youve said it has increased over once or twice a day.
"Yeah, um, normally, I smoke, you know, like once in the morning, uh, once during my lunch break and then in the evening maybe"
okay. ok. ok. So about 8 cigarettes. So over a day of packing?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
okay. ok. ok. And that changed over what period of time?
"Um, honestly, it's probably been over the years or so that I- I've been smoking a bit more than once"
okay. ok. ok. So the smoking has been increasing over the past year. And that mostly in the evening?
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um, I'm a 2 year old son as I mentioned, so I'm trying to never smoke around him. So I usually just wait until he gets to bed"
"Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. Well, that's the time when you can relax and unwind."
"Exactly, exactly. my-my schedule kinda went crazy right now yall know that. Um, I'm working full time and just started back at night classes. So, all that combined, enjoy that time to myself in the evening, I'm enjoying that time to myself."
"Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure. Well, its a time to relax and you have a lot going on."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
So are there other things you do in the evening to relax?
"Um, maybe I need like a drink or two."
okay. ok. ok. A drink or two. So about how many drinks would you say you have over the course of a day?
"Um, maybe like 2 max"
Two max. How many drinks would you say you would take over the course of a week?
"I'm not sure. I mean, I'm not really getting why you asked me that. I mean, I'm just here, you know, for regular visits. I-I'm not here to talk about my drinking."
"No, I understand-. And I certainly am not here to tell you what to-to do, Sarah. I'm interested to hear your thoughts and share some information with you, and what you do with that. You got this. Lots of things going on. You are a mother, you work, you attend school, and our healthcare team wants to make sure that you have all the. And my job as your healthcare provider is to listen to you and share information with you, including healthcare concerns associated with. Would that be okay with you?"
"Yeah, I guess."
"okay. ok. ok. We do know that an increase in smoking and alcohol associated with certain types of cancer; colon cancer, cervical cancer, breast cancer, and, um, also. Also associated with liver and lung disease as well as heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension. So much information but I-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"-interested in what your thoughts are, Sarah."
"Well, I-I just kinda surprised because, I mean, I'm not smoking or drinking that much. And I mean, compared to people I work with, you know, I-I smoke a lot less, and I feel like I actually tried to keep it"
So you are conscious of trying to cut back.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"My readiness ruler is in my pocket here, 0 means not ready to quit smoking at all and 10 means absolutely ready to quit. Where do you see yourself on that scale?"
"Um, maybe like 5"
About a 5. So you're halfway there. So why did you choose a five rather than a 4?
"Well, I mean, you brought up some creepy stuff like, you know, cancer risk or other stuff like that. And you know, being a mother, I-I'm not going to have something to happen to me obviously"
"Right. Right. Right. Well, that's a lot of information to consider. So given the fact that these healthcare concerns are a possibility, and that you are worried about your family and you sure have goals you. In other words, what steps would you consider taking for this number to move closer to a 10?"
"Well, I mean, I could maybe try to cut back in the evenings a bit."
"Oh, cool. Great. Lets quantify that a bit. So how many cigarettes would that have been?"
"Well, if I had like 5 or 6, I could try smoking 3 in the evening plus, still the couple during the day."
okay. ok. ok. So you--that's cutting back quite a bit. That's a big step. So I'm wondering if we could--wish we could--wish we could--wish we could--wish we could--wish we could
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure
"okay. good. good. good. As well as reviewing your plan, so we can go over your Laboratory results at that time. Would you like some smoking cessation information now?"
"Yeah, I-I think that would be very helpful."
"okay. ok. ok. Well, I got a brochure here and this has--it's a really good brochure. It has some distraction techniques in it in case you get those nicotine cravings. So this-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"-been helpful, um, in--with patients before. I also would like to ask, would you be willing to see one of our counselors?"
"Well, what-what for exactly?"
"Well, Dr. Kirtley is one of our counselor and is an expert in--at discussing the association of alcohol and stress. I wanna share something. The National Guidelines recommend that women have no more than 7 drinks of alcohol per week to-stay at that low risk level, to avoid the healthcare concerns that we"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Your alcohol intake is a bit higher than that, putting you at risk. So this is why I asked if you would be willing to talk to Dr. Kirtley."
"I mean, I'd love to talk about, you know, my stress, but I'm still unsure with the whole drinking thing"
"Definitely. Definitely. I'm glad you're willing to talk to him. So, before you leave today, lets, uh, stop by the scheduler's desk and make an appointment for me to see you back in 4 weeks. And that way, you all set. So do you have any other questions for me, Sarah?"
I'm not okay. I'm not okay.
"okay. ok. ok. Well, it was very nice meeting you. I see you in a month"
okay. ok. ok.
"Hi, Sandra."
Hi. Nice to meet you.
Thanks for coming in and talking to me for a few minutes. I understand you're not very busy but I really appreciate you stopping by
"Well, I came today because my daughter is in hospital as well. It's important to quit, but I enjoy smoking. I am not ready to give up right now. My life is too much in turmoil"
"So get the impression that some things are on your mind but that overall, coming in here wasn't necessarily the first thing that. Um, so can you tell me, what made this even possible for you to even come in. What-what was some of your thoughts?"
"-- I feel I'm a bad role model for my children, and my daughter turning 12, and already, some of her friends have tried smoking"
So the last thing you want is for your daughter to start smoking
"Ive smoked when I was younger, and I certainly dont want it for her."
"Hmm. Interesting. Those are some things that-that you also, uh, a bit concerned about, but as you said earlier, not-actually ready to put down your cigs"
"Well, that's true. This looks so hard. I just dont have time for this right now"
"So Sandra, whats good about smoking. What do you like about it?"
"Its very relaxing, relaxing, you know, a stress reliever. We all go out and smoke and chit chat and, yall know, talk about things when I get to work. Really would hate not smoking,. I would have been left out."
What else? Nothing else. tell me what else is good
"Hmm, I like having a cigarette after I eat. this kinda tells my brain im finished, stop eating, im full. So it's a- it's a way to-- you know, sometimes I'll have a cigarette instead of a snack, so it's a way to control my weight"
okay. ok. ok. So is there anything else you love about this?
"Let me think. Well, just enjoying it. I think its, uh, not good for me, I know but I feel so used to smoking that shit. Im not really considering quitting too much"
"So let me make sure that I understand all of the good things about smoking, the things that you like about it, and"
okay. ok. ok.
"So sounds like it's a way to relax. This is a way to socialize with your friends from work, and it's hard to imagine what it would be like for you at"
Thats true. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Smoking after meals is pleasurable, that's why smoking after meals is a way to manage your weight, and concern"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Also, I've heard that it's very much a part of your life. Its something that youve been doing for a really long time and almost impossible to think about yourself as a non smoker. Does this capture, for you, some of the good things or things that keep you smoking?"
Exactly. Exactly.
So I hear some things you like smoking. What about the other side. Can you tell me some of the not-so-good things?
"Well, I-I'm worried about my children. I'm feeling like I'm being a bad parent, and um, I often wonder, have they seen me smoke for years. Definitely not wanting my 12 year old daughter to start smoking, and some of her friends are already smoking"
"Sandra, can you give me an example of a time that you did something that you think left an impression on your daughter or set a"
"Yeah, just this morning outside having a cigarette, then when I looked up, there she was watching me smoke."
"So this morning, this experience, it really brought home how she does watch you, and she does really look up to you and. How did that feel when you looked up and saw her watching you?"
"I felt awful, yall, I was projecting-- I wanna be a good parent, and I dont feel this is part of the plan"
"And again, thank you for being honest about this. I'm appreciating that this is a- this is a hard topic to bro. This a-a hard behavior to think about giving up. one thing that doesnt make sense to me is that, on the one hand, you talk abou"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"-um, and on another note, I hear you say that smoking is important in terms of stress relief, socializing, and it. How do those two things fit together?"
"This doesnt fit, yall. This is the opposite side of the coin. I love doing this but I dont think its right"
"So what would it take to quit or change your smoking to be something that was more important, that raised it in your list of priorities?"
Right now I cant think of anything
okay. ok. ok.
Im not ready to quit. This is just something that comes to mind
"So, it's-it's not so much that you don't quit in a way, it's almost, ""How could I do this that would work for me?"""
Exactly. Exactly.
okay. ok. ok. I'm appreciating. We- we probably used up the time that we had. If you would schedule another appointment and talk more about this with me next week I would love to see you. Is that something that would be helpful?
"Oh, sure. Sure, Ill come in. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah."
okay. ok. ok. So I hear-- [crosstalk]
We can talk about that some more
"[chuckles] Not necessarily the most exciting thing for you to do, but I appreciate you being willing to do that. Can I also ask you to do a bit of homework between now and next week. I'm not too time consuming, I promise. Who is ready to get their top 3 reasons to change, and one of the exercises is to write down your. And then to reflect on some of the good things as we talked about, as well as some of the less good things about quitting and. Is this something you would willing to do over the next few days?"
"Okay, I'll give this a try."
okay here you go
Thank you. You are welcome.
So much love for you Sandra. So much love for you. We'll see you next week
Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok.
So I wrote a prescription for antibiotics for Aiden.
okay. ok. ok.
"Um, I was about to talk to you tho. I am a bit concerned looking through his chart of how many ear infections he has recently. And I-I noticed that you checked the box that someone is smoking in the home. So I was wondering if you could say more about that"
"Well, um, It's just me and him and I do smoke. Um, I'm trying really hard not to smoke around him but I-I've been smoking for 10 years except when I'm pregnant with. But it-- everything is so stressful being a single mom and- my having a full time job. And so it just--"
You're having a lot of things going on and smoking's kinda a way to relax and destress.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Some people have a glass of wine. Got a cigarette.
Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure. And it sounds like youre trying not to smoke around it. Why did you make that decision?
"I know this isnt good for him. I mean, I read those things about ear infections and asthma and stuff and-and, uh, but other kids have ear"
"So on one hand you worry about how your smoking might affect him and on another, you don't so sure that it's the"
"Right. Right. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, he's not asthma. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He-- I'm not-- he hasn't had a lot of other issues that his other friends have, so. And I thought quitting before was a good idea but I just dont- I just dont see how it could be right now"
What made you decide to quit smoking while you were pregnant?
"Well, he was inside me and we shared everything and I knew that he would get some of that. And I didn't-- I just didn't-didn't think I could live with myself if something happened to him."
It feels almost impossible to even manage or even try to manage right now?
"Exactly, exactly."
How was your successful when you quit before?
"I'm not sure. I-I'm thinking about it now, I don't even know how I did it. Just- I- I just did it. Just- I just- I just couldn't imagine like him not being born or going into labor early-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"-and- having issues and stuff like that, all the stuff that they talk about with women who smoke. So I--that was just enough to-say, ""Okay, you know what, I'm-I'm not going to risk that."". So. Much. To. The"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. The risks were so terrifying then that you could stop?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
But they're not as freaky to you now?
"No, I mean, we are two separate people. And like I said, I'm not, I'm trying really hard not to smoke around him. I'm pretty good about that. I-Im not letting other people smoke around him. Um, so I, you know."
You're doing the best you can
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes
okay. ok. ok. But part of you really does want to quit? That sounds to me too.
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I know that I need to, and I, you know, keep every new year I say, ""Okay, quit smoking"" but then something-. And quitting doesnt happen."
This is on your to-do list. Does this just not make it to the top?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"quit the scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is not at all confident, and 10 is you feeling pretty certain that you could, where do you fall"
"Probably like a 5. Kind of in the unsure area. I know Ive done this before so I know I can do it but at the same time, it just seems really hard. And it's not the same situation."
"Well, what made you say 5 rather than 2 or 3?"
"I know- I know all the ways this is bad for me. And I'm not okay with him growing up thinking that smoking is cool. I'm not trying to-- I'm not trying to-- I'm trying to-- I'm trying to-- I'm trying to--. Um, so I know I need to, especially before he gets old enough to understand what mommy is doing, but"
"okay. ok. ok. So it sounds like you have a lot of reasons to quit. You've been successful quitting in the past, and right now you're just feeling a bit hesitant about your ability to"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Where should we be going from here?
I'm not sure. I-I really want some help. I'm just not sure what kind of help I need
"Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure. Well, if you'd be interested, that's something I can definitely talk to you about. There are a lot of new options that can actually help people be way more successful in their attempt at quitting. There are different medications you can try."
I'm not a big fan of medicine.
"okay. ok. ok. There are also a lot of support groups and classes that you can take where you have other people to go through it. I think sometimes just having that support can be a big part of it, especially for people like you where smoking is so"
"Thats cool, but I dont think I have the time for all that"
Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure. feeling like something that would take up a lot of time and maybe not fit into your life. Wonder if we could talk about some options that might fit into your life.
That would be really cool
"okay. ok. ok. Well, if you're willing, then we could set up another appointment where you could come in and talk more abou"
I'd like that. I'd like that so. That would be awesome.
Awesome. Great.
Thank you. You are welcome.
Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure
"Ok, hard part is over. So the good news is no cavities."
"Oh, great. Great."
Yes always happy to hear that. I'm having some concerns though because I see some irritation in your mouth in the palate that's called nicotinic stomatitis and-
Thats bad. Thats what sounds like
"Yeah, it is. This roofing damage that happens from tobacco smoking and so I wonder if you can tell me a bit how--about how--"
"Tobacco. No. Well, I'm not smoking cigarettes. Ive never smoked cigarettes. Im doing a lot of my own thing. I do go out. Um, you know, we're going out to bars and, you know, we'll have a few drinks and smoke some of those lil cigarillo-type things. I mean I wouldn't even think of them as cigar and they are certainly not cigarettes. I'll have one or two of those in an evening with, uh, with my friends but definitely not 20 or 30 of them a day like you'd with cigs"
"So youve made a decision in your life not to smoke cigarettes, thats something you dont want to do. I think youre kinda concerned about the health effects of cigarettes. But youve been smoking the little cigarillos at least one or two every time you go outside"
"But that- that's just social. Thats something that my friends and I do. We-- We-- It's not habit or something that I have to have and, you know, talking about one or two when we go out. Not packs of them."
"Yeah, so you don't-- You don't have to-- You don't have to-- You don't have to--"
Oh no. No. No. No. No. No no no no no
The amount you smoke is so miniscule you can literally imagine that it would cause any harm and yet here it is damaging the roof of your mouth
"Well, we-- you have a point there. Ive started having one or two at work, you know, when we have break since Ive got a few friends at work that smoke and so. Um, I like the peach flavor [unintelligible 00:02:32] they are so cute. But that's only pretty recently"
"Uh-huh. Uhhhh. So smoking has kinda become a big part of your social life now huh. You smoking while you go outside, and even during breaks at work, you smoking."
"Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Now that you say it like that, you know that's a fact. Um, I do smoke on a daily basis."
"So aside from that social aspect, what are your favorite things about it?"
"Well, its relaxing and its just nice to be with people, um,. I like going to the cigar bars, is very sophisticated and fun and so when we go to Vegas, it's really"
okay. ok. ok.
I wouldnt say I was a chain smoker.
okay. ok. ok. How about the other side. Have you noticed any not-so-good things about smoking?
"I was going to ask you about, um, whitening my teeth because I noticed that they have more stains on them up than a few years"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So we are noticing some pretty negative effects in terms of your oral health with the smoking. Are there any other things that concern you?
"Um. Is. That. Okay. Well, there's the expense, you know. Wi-with the economy and all, um, I- I need to be careful about my money and so, um, there is the extra expense of if. So the-money aspect is also a concern."
"Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. So there's your oral health, there's the financial aspect, and then e-earlier you brought up some concerns about smoking cigs"
Lol. Yeah.
"Did you know that smoking these little cigarillos, the Swisher Sweets, can have some of the same negative health effects?"
"Oh, absolutely not. I mean I thought of it more as a- fun thing to do with my friends, certainly not a smoking habit or anything that"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. So its kinda surprising to you that something youve been doing and have been doing more and more of it is actually pretty
"Oh, yes. Thats it. That. I checked your form when you asked if I use tobacco, I checked ""No,"" because I never thought of myself as a smoker."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. What are you going to do now that you realize you are actually a tobacco user and that you might actually cause some pretty se
"Never mind, um, developing cancer, lung cancer, or any of the awful things that happen from smoking, and,. So-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
-I'm very concerned.
"At the point in which you stop smoking, you can actually reverse all the negative effects that occurred and you may also know that"
Seriously? Really? Seriously?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Is this something you would like?
"Oh, I'd definitely do that. I really would because, like I said, I'm a brand new smoker. I didnt know I was a smoker until I came to see you."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. On a scale of 1 to 10 where 1 is really don't think you could do it at all and 10 is really confident that you could quit if
"Lol, probably 7 or 8. I-I'm pretty confident that I could stop doing this."
"Okay, what made you choose 7 or 8 as opposed to a-a five?"
"Because it's not a part of my daily life. Smoking when I get up in the morning is not for me, uh, no. I'm not smoking 20 or 30 of these a day so it's not that much exposure and I-I feel pretty confident that I could stop"
"Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. You notice some negative effects of smoking, you have some concerns about health effects that could go awry, there's the financial aspect. So, where should we be going from here?"
"Um, I really need some more information about quitting. I mean Ive heard there are some-some new medications, there are some new things that can help people make quitting more com"
"Ok, well, I would be happy to talk more about that and give you some tips and advice and give you some"
That would be wonderful. Thank you. You are welcome.
I really appreciate you talking to me about this today
Thank you. You are welcome.
Hi Jean. Nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Selby. Nice to meet you.
Good morning doctor
How can I help today?
"Well, doctor, I- finally, I have a appointment with you, because I was diagnosed over 3 months ago with amonary disease, COPD."
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes
And although I didnt call right away. Really need some help quitting smoking
Right. Right. Right.
"So this is my first step, thought. So, uh, time to do something."
"Its time to do something, its okay. So youve been diagnosed by-"
A respirologist.
"A respirologist diagnosed that, and-and how are you feeling right now?"
"I- I'm- I'm really scared, uh, 'cause I'm not feeling well."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
I havent felt well in a while. I get coughing fits even when I have customers on the phone.
"Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. So it sounds like youve been smoking for so long and then this diagnosis was given to you, uh, and now that's really causing you"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. I-I'm not sure what I'm going to do about it.
okay. ok. ok. ok. Have you thought about quitting by now?
"I give myself 6 months, 6 months and-uh, that seems like a long time away but I have a feeling I'm failing at this point in time. Im not even 50% faith in myself, uh, faith in myself."
"okay. ok. ok. Although you want to quit smoking in the next 6 months, you're feeling a bit, um, under-confident that you'll actually do this and"
"I'm not sure what to do. I tried quitting smoking. It was a failed experiment. I did, uh, I took pills, I took the patch."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"I went through therapy. Uh, nothing has helped. finally- went to the doctor. Ive actually been in hospital. Ive been in hospital for a week and they are taking me out. That's the longest I've ever quit."
Right. Right. Right. So you quit smoking but only when youre in hospital
"I've had no choice, I've had no choice. And then the next day I was back to smoking again what I smoked"
"okay. ok. ok. Just step back a bit so that I can better understand where the difficulty that you have with me. Uh, could you tell me what is good about smoking for you?"
"Uh, this is part of my life. It's, uh, I started smoking when I was 13,14 at home, and I'm still smoking. My parents smoked. All of their friends smoked. This was on live. Everyone looked so grand."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Uh, smoking and all dressed up and fancy clothes and maybe having a drink in their hands and having a nice meal,. I guess its just an extension of me. This-this is good for my nerves"
Right. Right. Right.
"I mean, I feel this. I know when I got that package in my pocket, or know if there- if I go through some stress, I say, ""Oh, well, I'll have a cigarette and think this out."""
"Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure. So, Jean, I want to make sure that I understood what you told me of what you find good in smoking. So this helps you calm down. Gives you something to do. It was part of your image. You know you're feeling sophisticated. You're feeling the movie style. Honestly, the way you talk about it, it seems like that makes you feel like that. Is this correct?"
Thats right. Thats it. That
okay. ok. ok. Is there something I missed?
"Um, I'm enjoying it. It's just- it relaxes me. It feels great after a meal, um, for me-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"-we're all just doing it as a group of people, uh, my family."
Right. Right. Right.
"The people I work with, we go outside in the courtyard-"
Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure
"-have a cigarette and talk. Thats how you make friends. A lot of people, um, we are a little group now, we are all- a little group of us."
So it's hard for you to quit smoking when everybody else around you is smoking. And its so easy to go outside and take a break and have a cigarette
I-I never thought of that way but probably you're right
"You told me what is good to smoke for you. Uh, can you tell me what isnt so good about smoking for you?"
"Well, this is bad for my health and it's scaring me 'cause I'm not feeling well"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
I havent felt well in a while. I get coughing fits even when I have customers on the phone.
Is there anything else that isnt good to smoke for you?
"Um, it was expensive, really got expensive, and I smoked 30, 40, sometimes 50 cigarettes a day. And I'm starting to buy different make up 'cause I'm starting to really age, starting to get lines in my face and wrinkles and my skin"
okay. ok. ok. So let me make sure I understood this piece as well. good things about smoking for you are the effects on your physical appearance and how you'll look and-. And then the cost of smoking.
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes
"I asked you this question, given everything going on in your life right now on a scale of 1 to 10, where 10 is the most"
"I think it's for me, for my health, and for the money and all that I said, I'd say that's 10 or-out of 10 that I should quit smoking"
Definitely most important.
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. 100% one of the most important things.
"Another question and follow up to that. Again, given everything going on, where 10 is the most confident youll ever feel about anything and 1 is the least confident"
"Um, I, would say 35 or 40% competent."
35-40%. okay. ok. ok.
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I wanted to say more but, um,"
okay. ok. ok. help me understand why you said 40 and not something like 10 or zero because you mentioned that you dont even quit
"Well, I guess I'm still a fighter, and I-I-I-I-it's starting to- I'm starting to realize that and I do feel pretty. I- I- it was a step and a few people who cared about me actually, uh, gave me a pat on the back that I came to see. So-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"-this was a big step. So, I guess, yes. Um, that wouldnt have been as high maybe last week"
okay. ok. ok. So you said 30 to 40%. What would it take to build that confidence to about 45%?
"Maybe if I could come to see you again, or maybe some ideas were suggested, maybe if there was a group or. I-I'm not sure, but I-I need some help."
"So if you got help, that would help you say that you went from 40% to 45%."
I-I think so because I feel a bit better that I just came out to see you today
okay. ok. ok.
 Discussing things helps me. getting things out of my life always makes me feel better
"okay. ok. ok. I really want to congratulate you on taking this very important first step towards addressing this problem that youve had for so long, but as the first small step,. And the reason why I say that- because as you were mentioning to me, smoking is so automatic for you that sometimes writing it. And I noticed that you said to me, you feel a loss of control over these cigarettes. And sometimes just being mindful and writing something down will help you get some control over what you do. And that's often the first small step. What are your thoughts on that?"
"In other words, think about it more, dont- just do it automatically."
"Thats correct. Also, writing helps with that process."
"Yeah, yeah. I think so because, um, when I get the urge, I could maybe fight it and, um, maybe wait until the next urge-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"-and maybe mark that down that, uh, I didn't go right away when something went wrong. Um, yes, I can try that."
"okay. ok. ok. And I can give you a small card that can help you keep track of it. And if you can bring that back to another appointment, that could be something we could discuss. okay. ok. ok. Anything else?"
Nah that gives me something to work towards until I see you next week
"Excellent. Well done. Well, thank you so much for coming out today"
Thank you for seeing me doctor
You're welcome.
Is it okay if we go over the form you filled out. We're giving this out to everybody that comes in.
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. So here, it looks like you wrote that you drank alcohol on a few occasions in the last year, and used cannabis more"
Something like that.
"okay. ok. ok. When students and I talk about their substance use, the first thing that comes to mind, I dont like to tell. Thats not my job. I like to see if there is anything they would like to do, about their use, about. So what can you say about your marijuana use?"
"Uh, I'm vaping. I'm a pen but I'm not smoking it though"
okay. ok. ok. How often? Twice? Fucking twice
"Um, a few times a month."
Do you vape anything else besides marijuana?
"I've done peppermint oil once, someone shared it with me."
okay. ok. ok. Is it okay to share some information with me?
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"We know that marijuana has effects on the developing brain. Vape can make it harder for you to concentrate, it can make it harder for you to remember things, and your lungs. About 1 in 6 people who begin using cannabis as a teenager, later on, become addicted. So what do you think about all this information that Ive shared?"
"Well, I'm not sure that's going to hurt me."
How does this affect you?
"Um, I'm not sure. Makes me relax, and it makes me laugh with my man."
"Is there anything about marijuana that worries you, many things that you don't like?"
"Well, I'm not getting in trouble like at school."
How could you get in trouble at school?
"Well, I can get suspended and get kicked off the basketball team, the basketball team."
So staying in school and playing on the basketball team is important to you?
Right. Right. Right.
"So when you think about these things, are there any things you'd like to change about your cannabis use?"
"Well, I was thinking to not use when basketball season started."
What would be the benefits of that?
"Well, I'm playing better when I'm not high."
Marijuana affects how well you play. What would you get in return for the other benefits?
"Well, I wouldn't get caught using a pen so I wouldn't get kicked off the basketball team."
"okay. ok. ok. Well, it sounds like you have a goal of not using marijuana once basketball starts. How long you think you couldnt use?"
For about a month.
"okay. ok. ok. If I asked you to pick a number, 0 through 10, 0 meaning you are not very confident at all in meeting your goal, or 10"
"Um, 7. 7. 7. 7"
7. A seven. Why do you think you picked that instead of a lower number like 5?
"Well, I'm pretty sure, um, I can stop using for a month. Play well. I want to play well."
"So, what steps could you take to help you stop using for a month?"
"Uh, I'm not sure."
How about this question. What might happen within a month that might make you want to vape?
"Well, if I'm stressed or unhappy that's when I usually vape."
What else could you do instead of vaping when you feel that way?
"Hmm, I like video games."
Anything else?
Sarah can play basketball with me
Its a way to feel better about yourself. Playing basketball and playing video games.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Well, good to hear that you have a goal of quitting for a month and you are confident of reaching that goal. If you're willing to come back in a month or so, I'd be curious to hear how your plan works out."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Well, Goodluck with basketball practice. If you want anything or need to talk about something before our next appointment, I'm here Monday through Thursday"
"Okay David. Thats it. Thats. So, why not take a rinse, and how are you feeling?"
"Hmm, pretty good."
Would you-
"Check this out, yeah."
-check this out. What do you think?
oh that was fixed really well
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Youve got rid of that bad-
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-discoloration that was there.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No. No no no no no
That's what I like to see.
"Well, that went well. Good. Good. Good. Good. Excellent. Well done. I've noticed quite a lot of staining, actually. I wonder what are your thoughts on what might be related to that."
"Mm. the mf. Well, the usual suspects, smoking, wine, coffee-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-all of the above.
Any thoughts on considering quitting smoking at this time?
"Yeah, I thought about it. I just-- It's not my cup-- I-I hear it from everybody, and, uh, I've tried- I tried before, didn't work. I'm getting this all the time"
"okay. ok. ok. And it's like here I am one more person, the next- the next doctor who says, ""You need to quit smoking, David."""
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, [unintelligible 00:01:13] hmm."
"Mm, and I'm sorry, that's not how I mean to come across at all."
"Yeah, I-I-I know I'm not an asshole and people know that smokers are, you know, ""How can you smoke today?"". [coughs] quitting is just not that easy, uh,"
"Mm-hmm, and if it was as easy as the doctor is saying or your partner-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-saying-
"Uh, who wouldn't?"
- quit. you're done.
You would have to be a real idiot not to-
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"-if you [unintelligible 00:01:34] made this like this, then"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
I-I'm just hearing this everyday
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And what was your past experience smoking. Tell me--can you tell me a bit about kind of how the role it plays in your life, how long youve smoked?"
"Ive been smoking for 40 years, since I was 14-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"-and quit a few times, off and on in my 20s but, yall, it's been consistent. And now I cant see myself changing"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
I dont care what kinda talk I get or what they come up with.
It sounds like almost you tried a lot of things that are out there and it's not something that you relate
Not gonna work for me
"Yeah, yeah."
No. No no no no no
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"I know cold turkey is probably the only thing that ever does this to anybody that does it. Mysel- My group, it's been cold turkey-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
-and then they fight it but [sighs] it's my choice-
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
-and I'm not a big fan of lecture about it.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And it really is your choice. You're absolutely right-
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"-that nobody got the right to tell you what to do. Um, can I get an answer. If you were to--Uh, if there was to be a situation where you decide, ""I must quit,"" what-what would that"
Hard to tell 'cause Ive already had open heart surgery. That didnt do it.
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Prostate cancer, that didnt do it"
Right. Right. Right.
I'm not sure. I really dont know. Im just not really for this
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
Just-
"So, this is something that you-"
-have to-
-pretty much see yourself doing for-
"Yeah, quite a while. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah."
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. okay. ok. ok. I really appreciate you being willing to even talk about it. And this isnt something that you wanna pursue, this is something that I get now. Would it be okay if I brought this up in our next visit. 'Cause I- I know that you said you dont want a lecture but on the other hand, I am-"
"Oh, yeah. Okay. Couldve went for that. I-I, uh, I'm always open to some-- you know, to listen. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah."
As long as I dont talk too much?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [Laughs]
okay. ok. ok. [chuckles]
"[unintelligible 00:03:34] options. I've had some-- I've had my surgeon just go like, ""You- you're- you're- you're- you're- why do I even keep you as a patient"
Hmm. Interesting.
He was good though. [Laughs]
[chuckles] You're glad to keep him as a doctor?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yes, and, David, honestly, wherever you are, we will work with it."
okay. ok. ok.
"Um, and so thanks for- thanks for taking a few minutes and talking about smoking."
"Thanks, doc."
okay. ok. ok.
okay. ok. ok.
"Happy Birthday Jean, good to see you again"
"Good morning, doctor."
"So, what's been different since we talked a week ago?"
"Well, I've done what we discussed. Got the journal-"
okay. ok. ok.
"-for a week, uh, trying to mark down the- difference in my smoking, being more aware when I had the urge, if"
Mm. the mf.
"-and found this ok. The weekend got a little bit spooky because, uh, the urge keeps coming-"
Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure
-to have a cigarette.
Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure
"I can cut down at least 2 or 3 cigarettes a week, but that's just in one week. So-"
"So, youve been able to cut down by 2 or 3 cigarettes. Thats awesome. I mean, given how much you were smoking."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"So, you were able to keep the, uh, journal?"
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes
"You-- Sounds like you did that, and that allowed you to really focus on the time [unintelligible 00:00:57] delaying your cigarettes. So-so that went well. So, what are the things that arent going as well as you would like?"
Just seemed to get worse when it was the weekend-
Right. Right. Right.
-and I was going out with friends and I was home a lot of the day-
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"-instead of at work. And found that, um, those urges were really hard to stop."
"okay. ok. ok. So, these automatic cigarettes, when you socialize and you-- you have time on your hands, really, are the problems that you"
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes
"-uh, and that you noticed are harder than the others?"
"But I marked it in my book. Uh, that's one thing I said to myself, I'll be honest in my marking down."
"In marking it down, ok"
"So, I need to really be aware of weekends. Maybe get some kind of hobby or-or join some group or something on weekends to keep me busy."
"okay. ok. ok. So, and you thought you were going to do, such as getting a hobby, what you might do. Any other thoughts on how you might be able to help you overcome this?"
If I can just postpone this-
okay. ok. ok.
"-and- say, ""Okay, I don't want it at home-"
Right. Right. Right.
"-I'll have it when I get to work or on the way to work."""
Right. Right. Right.
'Cause I-I-
Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure
"And then, uh-uh, what I want to do is try not to smoke in my house."
"okay. ok. ok. So, from now on to the next time you come back and see me, what is it that you'd like to-work on?"
I'm thinking I just want to do whatever I do this first week. I liked the idea of marking it down.
"Ok, so you can continue with that."
"I-- And it took me a week and I'm down 2 cigarettes a day, I-I figure."
Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure
"I just want to be able to go down to like 5 cigarettes, in other words, another 3 a day."
okay. ok. ok.
"And, um, 'cause I smoke a large pack and small pack, maybe just two small packs."
Youve said 5 cigarettes this time
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes
And any thoughts on what concretely you could do to make that happen?
I'm allowed to try each day to count.
Right. Right. Right.
"And I still gotta try that when I get the urge to let it go, fight it, and maybe not go outside for a cig"
Right. Right. Right. [unintelligible 00:02:58]
"So, if I [unintelligible 00:02:59] between two of them-"
Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure
-and also coming back and- talking to you really helps 'cause I have someone to-
Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure
-discuss it with.
"So, given what you-you are trying to do, when would it be good for you to come back and talk abou"
"I wouldnt mind coming back in a week because this is all new and- a week, I can handle a week"
Absolutely. Absolutely. okay. ok. ok.
Okay thank you doctor
"Good. Good. Good. Good. So, we'll see you in a week."
"Yes, thank you."
"Hey, can you help me?"
"Yeah, I hope so. Um, my workplace just went smoke-free. I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I. I will keep smoking but I was wondering if there was anything that-that could help me like get through the day. Its like, go get my beer and smoke cigarettes after work."
"So your workplaces went smoke free and you hate it, huh?"
"No. No no no no no. I will never quit smoking. I mean, I like that. This helps me relax. So, I mean, I'm not seeing what the big deal is."
okay. ok. ok. Tell me a bit about how smoking fits in your day. It will help with the multiplying
"Im like, I smoke less than a pack a day. Not too bad. Um, I probably smoke for the past 5 years but I-I-I-I mean, could quit if I wanted to, but I don't"
"okay. ok. ok. So you feel like, smoking is a pretty important part of your daily life right now. Its not something youre ready to change, its something you feel comfortable enough to do that."
Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure. I'm allowed to quit.
okay. ok. ok. What makes you so confident?
"I dont see why I couldnt, I--although I have never tried quitting, its just something that I do for fun, you know, at work"
"Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. Uh, uh, readiness to actually go ahead and make a quit attempt, where do you think you fall on the scale of 1 to 10,"
"I'm probably a 2. I-I havent even thought about quitting and until this great announcement at work today, I- I-"
okay. ok. ok. What made you say 2 instead of 1?
"Well, I mean, anything is possible. I mean, I-I guess I could possibly be convinced. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Is there some-- I mean, are there things I can try that make me like want to quit smoking?"
"Well, there are a lot of products available now that can actually help curb that urge to smoke. This can help to replace nicotine, which can help to decrease withdrawal symptoms that you might experience when quitting or cutting down and also some medications that your doctor"
"okay. ok. ok. Well, that’s good information. I mean, I dont have anything to do today. I'm just need to know my options but that's encouraging. I-I do have at least tools to help me quit smoking if I decide to quit."
"Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure. And back to that scale, you mentioned, you said you were a 2. What would you do to move you up to a 4 or 5?"
"I'm not sure. I guess if one of my friends decided to like quit with me, thatd probably help too, but I--all my friends love to smoke"
"Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure. Wonder if now that your workplace is smoke free, if some people at work are planning to quit."
Thats a good point. I really didnt think I would ever get this. Thats a good idea. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"okay. ok. ok. Well, it sounds like you are really here just for the information today. I'm happy to help you pick out some of these products if and when you decide that the time is right for you."
"okay. ok. ok. Well, thank you a lot."
"So, what brings you here, Bob. What can I do to help?"
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, well, the only reason I'm here is 'cause my wife thinks I'm a problem with smoking. Ive been smoking all day and, uh, 6 months ago, she thought, she got into this health kick, right. And now everyone who smokes is evil. And, uh, so this is why I'm here just to please her, get her off my back and cardiovascular"
"So, you're not too happy to be here. This is the last thing that you want to be doing this afternoon"
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Thats an understatement. I mean, I have to be at work right now, right. So-"
"You took time off you, it cost you time and money being here."
"Yeah, yeah. I only got here because my wife forced me to come, yall know that. Like this has come to a head 6 months of just nagging me, relentless every day, because she was able to quit smoking and now"
"So, here's a question for you, Bob, what are some of your wife's concerns about your smoking?"
"Well, she's concerned about my health and she cuts out all these articles about second hand smoke and Cynthia"
"Wow, that she showed you and made you read."
"Yeah, I needed to read this. Thats my reading assignment for breakfast and I want to go outside and have-- We used to go out and have--. I gotta get outside in this weather again, yall know what that means. And she used to smoke more than me and now shes like holier than now?"
"So, you're pretty angry about that. It's pretty outraging that you have to change your whole life because of a decision she made 6 months ago."
"And she got my kids on this against me, yall know, my son and my daughter, they ganged up on me, yall know what I mean?"
"So, from your perspective, do you see any consequences to your smoking?"
"Well, the big one of course is how it affects my wife and the family. My dad is 85 and still smokes. I mean, yeah, you know, sometimes I think quitting is a good idea, but I mean, I don't know. I'm not sure if I can-- I'm not sure if I can quit."
"So, let me make sure I understand kind of the whole scenario 'cause there are a lot of pieces to it. Your wife is on your case and your kids are ganging up too. So, you sort yourself out, you put yourself in a corner and you're told this is something you have to do, you have no choice"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Some of your concerns are about your health, but that's not really the driving force. It sounds like it would be nice if things just went back to how they were before she quit smoking and that all of this stuff. Does this pretty much sum up--?"
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I-I just, I dont want her or my family over smoking."
"being in a relationship is so important to me, I get the feeling that you really care. That would be anything you would do."
"Yeah, I mean, we've been married over 25 years, and uh, we've never had major issues. Like this is-- this is the first problem. Problem cause we used to both smoke and I was trying to accommodate them by smoking outside but it feels like"
"So, it strikes me that the way that we are talking about it, it's like it's all or nothing. Things continue to go downhill and get worse, your wife gets more and more on your case, or you put your cigs down starting the moment you walk in. Almost like one or the other. I feel like this might be a good place to strike out on the middle ground here that it took you a long time to"
"So, I can actually do this that way like gradual taber?"
Some medications and some different approaches that we can use that are not so abrupt. Recognising that it-it-will-take-some-time and practice to get to where you might want to be.
"Wish my wife couldve come today cause she feels after like, just stop like right away. So do I think she could come with me at a future appointment or something and she could hear that message?"
I would be more than happy to talk to both of you if you wanted to bring your wife along
"okay. ok. ok. I need to talk to her as well because their schedule changes from week to week, she works shifts so"
okay. ok. ok. That sounds good.
Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok.
Thanks for coming in.
okay. ok. ok. Thanks. For the follow!
"Hi Carrie, thanks for coming out today."
"Thank you, my doctor [unintelligible 00:00:05]"
What brings you in?
"Well am having, um-- Ive been an ongoing problem with smoking and trying to quit."
"So, you're gonna give up those cigarettes?"
"Oh Ive been wanting to, for years"
"Yeah so then its, uh, right now, tell me a bit about, um, right now at this point in your life why it"
Well I have a 15 year old daughter and she strongly opposes it. I get--not getting younger and having asthma and having chronic bronchi--having a hard time breathing when I exercise and not
Like being a leper in a leper colony right now to be a smoker.
Actually being a leper in a non-leper colony is like being a leper in a le
"'Cause you can't find a leper colony anymore. So, um, so it- it's really important to be a good mum-"
Right. Right. Right.
-and model for your- for your daughter who is at this age where 15 would be a really common age at which she might
"Right and she's been expressing, y'all know, she walks in and she's like shhh and it's embarrassing for her friends and,"
"okay. ok. ok. So, you-you wanna look good, you know, and she proud of you I'm sure anyway and then this just. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah."
"Right right, yeah."
"So, and then you mentioned quite a few things about medical issues. So, um, you mentioned, um, asthma, um, acute bronchitis did you sayfigure"
oh and emphysema the beginning stages
"Oh my goodness. okay. ok. ok. And so, and this--oh, so, and this--oh, so, and this--oh, so, and this--oh, so, and this--"
Thank you. You are welcome.
"Well, I mean that's-that's, tell me about when you were diagnosed with that."
"I really couldnt tell, um, I remember when my daughter was like 5, um, I remember having a problem with humidity-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"-you know, for breathing, um, and, um, I was trying to stick my head out the window to gasp for air-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
-and my daughter became so terrified that she went next door to our neighbor and called 911 and it truly Goldberg
Smart girl. Smart girl. Smart girl
"Yeah-Yeah she's very intelligent. On this chair type thing in my robe and my daughter was in sure panic, um, thinking she lost me and shes 15 so"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"-unsuccessfully, uh,--"
Tell me a bit about what happened with the-the- Chantix.
"Well, um, I'm not sure if this is my lack of willpower but, um, also had ve-very bad side effects from it so"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. Wh-What sort of if-if you are willing to talk about what kind of side effect CBO
"Um, I've had nightmares-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
-nausea-
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"-um, stomach problems, and agitation. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah."
"Oh really. Thats it. That. I heard too that people especially you know those are, um, some people who have a lot of success but when"
"Right and it didnt stop me from smoking as well so that means, uh, [laughs] Cynthia"
Want the good [crosstalk] no good right. And how long ago was that youphalic
"Um, that was about 2-3 years ago."
Ok. All the best.
Ive tried this a few times. It works for me.
okay. ok. ok.
"I'd get a, um, new prescription refills thinking, ""Oh I could try this time."""
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
And I've had friends that it works for-
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Um, and there is a support group that they have that you can go online or call-"
okay. ok. ok.
-but of course I didnt do either but-
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
-umociation
Just didnt fit for you to do online
No. No no no no no. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"okay. ok. ok. So um, but you gave it a good try and it was just not a good fit for you like you- you really listened to what your body said"
And agitation really-
Oh yeah. Thats it. That
"Um, being at my big age I go through the menopause stage which is part, you know, you'll have that anyways and then"
"So, it's already stacking I'm thinking up for you, you don't need anything else so you look for some relief and"
"Exactly, exactly."
"Um, have you ever been able to quit smoking completely?"
Only when I was in hospital. [chuckles]
okay. ok. ok.
"And even then I-I snuck out and got a cigarette, you know"
"okay. ok. ok. So, what's the longest you ever go without a cigarette including being in hospital?"
"Oh god, I would have to say, uh, 3 days."
"Oh, 3 days. I mean, that's a long time and I felt, you know, that's a pretty long time to go without smoking and I'd imagine,"
"But it wasnt really by choice, it was by, um, the situation I was in, I wasnt able to smoke so, yeah"
You've been forced to-
Right. Right. Right.
-not smoking? -not smoking? -
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
What did you notice during those 3 days when you werent smoking?
"Um, constant thoughts about smoking."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Um, just as, um, chocoholic craves chocolate-"
Mm. the mf.
-I've been craving my cigarette
You've been [unintelligible 00:06:04]
"Exactly, exactly. Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um, and the first thing when I was able to smoke, I didn't care if I smoke my brand or anybody elses brand, I just wanted that"
okay. ok. ok.
Nicotine is the addiction.
Right. Right. Right.
"Also the-and also the-psychic thing, yall know, with-- I mean, I wake up in the morning, I want a coffee with"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Um, if I'm stressed, coffee with a blunt."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Just cigarette. I mean, just cigarette. Um, so it always, like, is-it a duel kind of problem I think-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
-you know-
Mm. the mf.
-I found this to be.
"It does, uh, it does a lot of positive things for you."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"And it sounds like pairing, like a coffee and a cigarette. I mean, probably hard to think about, ""How will I have a cup of coffee without a cigarette?"""
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"You know, and, um, that actually, yeah, that's a-- I think it does become very paired with lots of. So, um, let me know if you do, because of the way cigarettes you describe it and accurately is--. And-"
"Oh, really? Oh, really? Oh"
"-At any given moment, whatever it is, will do whatever it takes to make it happen. The downside is-is it-is kinda get, it gets in the end with the health."
Lol. Yeah.
It will-it will take a good usually 10 years off your life minimum.
"My aunt was like, ""put another nail in your coffin"" you know, as they say."
okay. ok. ok. What do you think when she says fuck you?
"cocky and I say, ""well, you know, aunt Kathy, you were my role model, and back in the day, um, I used to envy and watch"
Glamourous. Glamourous.
"Yes, yeah. And that's what I associated with at the time and now it's almost, I'm ostracized for it"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"So, it kinda looks like a double edged sword."
"So, and I would- I would- it really is because it wasnt like that 20 years ago."
Mm. the mf.
"30 years ago, it wasnt like that"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"So, it became harder to be a smoker. You're lighting up a cigarette and people are making assumptions about you."
Oh yeah and you gotta travel like 10 miles-
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
-in order to have a cigarette. And not say you are in a situation and only have a 15 minute break-
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"I mean, you can finish your cigarette and its back within a certain amount of time and it takes you, like, 7 minutes"
Mm. the mf.
"-and a cigarette, um, for me takes 5 minutes to smoke"
okay-okay. ok. ok. Sophalous
"I have been told many people, um, if I quit smoking, I gain weight."
Mm. the mf.
"Well, food really doesnt taste good, but they say it tastes so much better-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
-if you quit smoking.
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
I need to gain weight now the downside to that
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"This means a new wardrobe, which I couldnt afford but can't afford."
okay. ok. ok. So right now you see that this is a part of your life. 18 years of being off and on is a part of your life
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
It became a more important part of your life because you found yourself smoking at times that you thought I'll never smoke again
Right. Right. Right.
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And your worry is that if you stop, youll end up gaining weight. So I hear this kind of list of things that dont feel so positive about stopping."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
I wonder what else might be on that list
"Um, withdrawal."
Mm. the mf.
"They say it's awful. Um, being cranky."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"And if I do go through this, I just hope my friends understand and support me in whatever I do."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. okay. ok. ok. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So added to the other list is having to go through withdrawal-
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"-the unpleasantness of that. okay. ok. ok. What else might be on the, not so good side about smoking- about stopping?"
"Um, I think everything is on the bad side about smoking but, um, I just smoked so long that I. I-I'm just unable to imagine-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
-not- going through life without smoking.
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"I know I gotta stop. Uh, I have no health issues from cigarettes-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
-at present but when the doctor told me this morning what could be waiting for me in the future-
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
-that made me rethink-
Mm. the mf.
-everything. to. me.
"So, thank you for coming out today"
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes
How are you feeling today?
I'm feeling great actually
Yeah? Oh yeah. Good. Good. Good. Good
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Good. Good. Good. Good
I'm feeling good.
"And so you did your clarifications, value clarifications-"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-and what are your top 5?
"Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. I had a good, uh, experience. It was different. It was different than usual. There were several things that were different, and, uh, the number one value that I put was self-respect. And I-I dont even know if self respect has ever been in my top 5 let alone my number one"
Seriously? Really? Seriously?
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And, umphalage"
Is there any reason why that is?
"I'm thinking about an idea, I think, why that's so. Ive been a few things that have happened recently and something that really came to my awareness, when I visited with my family,. And Ive consistently, uh, almost not considered myself in the equation. I mean, at the time that I realized it, it was, uh, kinda sad. Uh, I didn't realize how severe this actually is, but I was kind of glad that I realized it because I feel"
True. True. True.
"-and I feel that I can- I can, uh, respect and value myself just as much as I do other people. I know that's important. I feel like I'm a better person for other people as well."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. By not putting yourself on the back burner so much?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Because I'm getting stressed, resentful, overwhelmed and, uh, out of sorts, I guess."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
And I cant be the best- the best me possible
For someone else? No thanks.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
For your family?
"For myself or for someone else, either way, yeah."
"So much of your time is spent on putting yourself on the back burner that you neglect yourself, or that you just ha"
"Almost-- Like, I think that some people might not even think that I put that first, but in my mind and my emotions, I was carrying. I was letting what other people wanted me to do to dictate my actions instead of letting my own values dictate."
Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow
"And that's something that I've had for so long, literally since I was a child, that I didn't even know I was doing"
So much of your-- Part of your paradigm?
"Yes, yes. Yes, yes."
"So, do you think sometimes you werent even aware"
"Not at all. Completely unaware. Totally unaware, yeah. And so to me, I feel like this is a celebration. Uh, moan and complain about my childhood and about all the cruel, mean things that people said and did, and I felt--. I'm capable of giving myself a voice. I'm allowed to give myself an opinion. If I want to live like this, I can live like this. Nobody stopped me from this, only me."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"So, thats what I want to do."
Mm-hmm.And it's the first time in a while that I haven't felt guilty for saying that.
The very first time that you can remember?
"Yeah, I'd say so. I'm not sure if Ive ever said this in front of people and not felt the least twinge of guilt for it. [chuckles]"
Thats not selfish
No-
Right. Right. Right.
"-it's not, it's really not."
"Cool, that's awesome."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And so you felt you came about this change, and-and-how does it make you feel?"
"Well, this makes me feel jubilant. This makes me feel joyous. This makes me feel hopeful. Makes me feel like I count, like I matter. I feel like I can do whatever I want with more joy and more passion, and less dread and a sense of responsibility, because one of the"
Because you- felt so obligated.
"Yes, because it turned into an obligation instead of just really a sense of like you know passion you. My passion is gone completely. I'm not sure I'm just happy I feel like I got back in touch with myself. I lost for a while and now I'm like back again, yes, now I remember why I wanted to do this or like why this is"
"Yea, is that on your top 5 also"
"Nah but um, the other ones I have on there, uh, are, number two, inner harmony. I need to be able to be harmonious within myself before I can be harmonious with other people."
Self love gives you peace?
"Yes, and then I put family happiness."
That's very good.
"Yes, because I think that when I'm at peace with myself, uh, that automatically contributes to my family happiness. me bringing my unhappiness to my family when i know its true"
Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure
"Uh yeah, when I dont have self respect and only give my family a say on who I am and what I should do, I am angry at them"
Feeling resentful.
"I resent them, I really do, when I get in that mode. Yo, I'm a person of this family and I deserve this much time and energy and attention and just more than anyone else"
Right. Right. Right.
"Health and achievement, this one on achievement says a sense of accomplishment and to me that kind of goes along with what we were. I could be your- I could be your- I could be your- I could be your- I could be your-. I could show up an I could just do a really poor job and go home and probably keep my job for a while, it wouldn't be the first time?"
Right. Right. Right.
But I'm not feeling good about that
You're not feeling fulfilled.
No. No no no no no
Like you did anything helpful
Right. Right. Right. Right.
Its because you showed up and gave out
"I just want my paycheck to be enough to just show up and get it. That doesnt, I dont feel fulfilled so it-it, thats the way I see it going together with the help. It's not just about helping to like look good or to exhaust myself or do what I think I should but to really give"
Meaningful.
"Yeah, meaningful, even if it's-it's-so-small."
"Sometimes small details really do count, too."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"So all of these things put together feel like right now at this point in life, that its really healthy change for you, like where you"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Thats awesome and is there anything else on the list that you felt like it was coming close to some of the other top 5?
"Well, one of the things about this list that surprised me was almost every time I did this list, uh, creativity and freedom. And it didnt even make it to my top 5. This was in my top 12."
Uh-uh. Uhhhh.
"But I think the conclusion that I came to is that I can be more creative and have more freedom if I have inner peace and. Part of what- part of what binds me, part of what takes my freedom away is when I just explain all over the place and. Part of what steals my creativity is when I- my mind is reeling around in stress and I cant- I cant even hear myself. Cant even hear myself thinking. How can you be creative if you cant even hear yourself?"
All the chatter.
"Yeah, exactly, to me the creativity comes from the silence, comes from the quiet. Literally-- I can just be in silence for even if for a few moments. Its amazing the ideas that come to me so fast and so easily that would take me hours to figure out if I was stressed"
Thank you so much for sharing
"Thank you for listening,"
"Well, I'm here because my mom wants me to be here"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
Im not really here but this-it-whatever.
Got it. Got it. Got it
"Um, she-she found my stash-"
Uh-huh. Uhhhh.
"-and she freaked out, and went apeshit over it. Um, I'm not why she was going through stuff in the first place but whatever, so, now"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Um, Ive been hanging out with a new cool crowd that I really like."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Uh, a-and-and that's-that's basically it."
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So-so you got this new group of friends and-and, um, you- actually kinda like where you are with things right now. And your mom was going through your stuff and found your stash, and it just turned into, y'all, all of this."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Yeah, basically."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"And, uh, sounds like you're-you're pretty upset that your mom-for doing that?"
I'm. So. Fucking.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"I mean, its my stuff, idk why sheipolar"
"Right. Right. Right. It's like your private place and, you know, it's--that's--that's your stuff."
I-Im not going- I'm not going through her s- I'm not going through her stuff. Im not going through her purse. Im not Goldberg III diabetic. I equate
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So why should she go through yours?
Right. Right. Right.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
Baby was up all night and Im exhausted
"So, what you say is you had a rough night?"
"Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. I dont understand how she was up every 3 hours to eat, I dont get it"
"So, she needed to eat every 3 hours last night and that was really frustrating for you?"
"Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. my mom told me that i started sleeping through the night when i was like a month old, Lilly is 6 weeks"
"Hmm. Interesting. So, based on what your mom told you, you expected Lilly at this point to be sleeping through the night?"
"Well, what is normal for a baby this age?"
Hi. Nice to meet you.
Hi Deborah. How was your day?
"Good, I'm doing really well"
"Yes, um, so you did your Values Clarification Sheet. Is there anything that you would like to talk about that you discovered?"
"Yeah, I really like doing this, and, um, I-I rated health as my first-"
"Oh, so it's your first?"
"-uh value. Yeah, because I really value physical and mental health, um, spiritual, emotional. Healthy as a whole package, I suppose. Um, and I have a certificate to become a fitness trainer. Cal State [inaudible 00:00:40] there's a like extension program. Ive been doing this for the past 5 weeks. Got my final exam coming up, like, Saturday. A little tense about it, but, um, I look forward to, like, doing, and I gotta wait for my results. Then, got into an internship."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Um, but this is kinda exciting, a different career path in my life. Being an office worker for so long gets tiring too--physical activity, health, in that regard."
"So, health being your number one, um, which is kind of pushing you into this new direction, as far as you being a prior officer. Youre doing something that you actually live to do."
"Yeah, I like being active. If I could, um, be more adept to tennis, and do something like this coaching people how to play. I know enough about the game and play it but I- I- I- don't think my skill level would be high enough to actually coach other p"
Have you done this sheet more than once now?
"Yes, I do."
"And then, has health always been number one for you?"
"It was in the top. It was up there, yeah. I'm not sure if it's always been number one. Definitely top 3. Uh, yeah, because I have had problems, um, with inner harmony, I guess in different stages in my life, so. I put this number 2 this time."
Inner harmony is number two?
"Yeah, just funny how it came out that it wasnt in the top 12. But then when I look at it again it had to do with, um, peace, uh, inner peace or something in there"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"And, um, I'm putting that as a higher priority, or top of my value list."
"So, would you like to express more on the inner harmony part of how that affects your life?"
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I was practicing yoga, and since I learned how to teach yoga, that's been something that's come to terms with more, that I feel. I have more peace of mind, and in-in the quiet times, and if I meditate, I'm doing it."
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Um, I really feel like-- yeah, I feel like really good about myself."
"So, yoga, is that based on the number two, like inner harmony. Thats where that comes from?"
"Yeah, that part is part of it. Yeah and then just feeling like, um, I dont have to please other people either. Putting myself first isnt selfish. And, uh, that's something I always try to do, make other people happy, please other people, and-. And I always thought, ""Well, that's the way a good person should be. They should always put other people first, you know. And then there are times for that, you know. Something is going on and you wanna go out of your way to help people, and you say, ""Well, my needs aren't so. Once in a while I think thats okay. As long as you know- you know that you arent really, um, doing anything detrimental to yourself while you. And you realize, ""Well, I just-- I really help this other person a lot, and it gives me satisfaction."""
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Not out of a sense of, uh, you know, ""I owe this person an obligated"
"Yes, yes, yes. So, basically, reflecting on how you felt before about you coming second, third, and fourth. Um, it was- it was really a problem, y'all, like, how could you be so, y'all, selfish, and think ab-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"-the reality is inner peace and inner harmony is based around, you know, self worth, and you know, self--"
Self love. Self love.
-self love.
Yea mm-hmm yeah. [crosstalk] And that it's not selfish.
"Yeah thats not selfish. And so you feel as though you can help, you can be of help to others, um, just as long as it's not harmful to. This is so true."
"Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um, then, and but also service, that's third because I really enjoy helping other people. Being there for other people, you know, and-and if it puts me out, it puts you out. My brother, his daughter, and his granddaughter come over and, uh, I sleep on-air mattress and, uh, me with my mother and my dad--"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"And I do that but I think, well, its one night or its two nights that I have a guest. All the other days I could sleep in my bed. [unintelligible 00:05:54]"
"So, even if it's a bit inconvenient for me, or my house getting messy, or my kitchen getting a mess, it's ok. I'll be live. You know that. Yall know its ok, its not a big deal. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Before it was wisdom, because I really, that's, um-- it's high on my list and it might be higher if these other"
"But I like I enjoy learning and experiencing different cultures going, um, to different places in the world and then just being around p. And I think that brings a lot of wisdom. Also, being open to, uh, differences. Election Day realizing that something might happen, uh, in Congress or the Senate, thatll be sorta against my values but"
"And in the sense of you saying in your words, living."
Right. Right. Right. Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"Um, having that as a priority, um, do you feel as though, like you said before youll live, but"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
And learning the differences between the different cultures that brings you wisdom.
"Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. And school learning outside of class. Where I spent 2 months in the summertime really, learning about the cultures is a beautiful place to be, there's a lot of wisdom. And, uh, fun, pleasure, satisfaction-"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"-enjoyment. I think it's intermingling in a lot of things. It's fun to learn about pe-- other people, other cultures. having inner harmony is fun. I'm thinking that- I think that was an all-encompassing thing about life. The part of it is to experience pleasure. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah."
So pleasure being your number five
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
okay. ok. ok.
"I know the flip side of that, uh, um, I-I know there will be pain, disappointment, upset in my life, um, too that I accept that"
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
True joy comes from knowing that it will never be happy. I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I-
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That
"I will be disappointed, I will get injured or whatever"
So you took that into consideration-
Absolutely. Absolutely.
- things may happen in life.
Mm-hmm. Thats it. That. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Your list sounds as though it's a story. I-It kinda attracted you in the beginning as far as your health and the number two was being service. Number three. Number three. Uhphal relationship
Inner harmony.
"Inner harmony was number two, and having that peace of then to allow other people or to serve-service."
Right. Right. Right.
"Not being, y'all know, whatever you do for others. That being, um, as far as, like you said within yourself, that you won't find, um, problems with helping other p. And, uh, that's when service which is your number three or number four, which has wisdom. And then 5 which being pleasure, which is also okay, I see the whole world and I see the. You get bummed one day but finding joy and pieces [unintelligible 00:10:21]"
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"Well, that was nice talking to you"
"Yeah, it was nice being here and having you listen to me.  Encouraging me was okay"
okay. ok. ok.
