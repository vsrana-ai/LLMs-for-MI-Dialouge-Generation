(2)_Basic style
thank you very much for coming to my house today.
you're welcome. You're welcome.
"yes, I'm glad you appreciate it. well, um, your mom called me and said, uh, there were problems with kids at school and, uh, they were mean and, uh, that's a hurtful thing."
yes. I've been in school for two times because of bullies and everything.
"it's a lot of school, you know."
"as I was leaving school, there were more rumors. I'm going to go back and like the rumors. I've been in the principal's office for a day, and I've been escorted to the school by security guards, like I was at home."
people like to tell stories.
"from the fifth or sixth grade, I'm blamed for everything that's going on."
"as a question, what kind of-"
"because the kids. 'cause I'm a little annoyed. when people tell me things, I like to talk more like the person, and I think the kids who like to blame me for everything say I'm easy to talk about, and I like to talk about it."
"so tell me a little bit more about what you mean, can you tell me a little bit about what you're talking about?"
"""I've heard of you."" If someone says, ""Oh, I've heard of you."". ""oh, really, what is it?"" I'm like, ""What do you mean?"". as if someone wanted to beat me up, I'd like to go, and I'd say, ""Okay, then hit me."". I'd like to stay here and talk more."
what happens when you don't leave it?
"maybe more like it's going to be bigger and bigger. it's like if you stop her, they don't know what to say, they're like, ""Oh, like she's gone."". as long as I don't talk it, it's just like if I'm talking to him-it's going to build up and we"
"all right, all right, all"
-and he called the principal's office.
"all right, all right, all"
-and they'll talk to you.
"all right, so what do you think after the spanking in the principal's office?"
I usually try to tell myself to leave it alone.
mm-hmm.
"-but if someone says something about me, I'm gonna be mad 'cause like what the hell, like you're talking about me like I'm trying to stop, but sometimes I just say a couple of words. I'm trying to do better now."
mm-hmm.
"I just said, ""Wow, it's really lame, like I'm just gonna leave."""
it's really nice of you to do this.
yes. I'm proud of myself.
"you're proud of yourself, and how did you do it?"
"mom's like, ""I don't want to help you anymore."". because she says I should leave it, but I'm not listening to her. I'm thinking about what she would have done if I told her, ""This is lame, I'm not going to say anything."""
"it's a great thing about your relationship with your mom, but it's a little bit of a problem for you."
yes.
"what do you mean. it's really cool, but not everyone can. it's almost like watching a movie."
yes.
-and knowing what it's gonna be.
"because if I'm in trouble, Mom will usually treat me like a silent one. she doesn't talk to me, I'm like trying to talk to her, she's not happy."
"it's the worst, the silent treatment."
yes.
"you know, so, um, but you've done it, you've done it, you've done it, you've done it, you've done it, you know, and, uh, you've done it, you know, and, uh"
yes.
so you're saying it's okay?
yes.
it's-- It's-- It's
"it was weird, because the eighth-grade kids who liked me didn't even talk to me, and I was like, weird."
"well, when someone else told you that you were easy to target, um."
"well, I don't really say it like I like it, 'cause I like what my mom told me, and people talk to me-"
"all right, all right, all"
-so they're coming back to me.
"all right, so they're pretty good at hooking you."
mm-hmm.
-and pull you in-
yes.
"-all right, and you're gonna upset him. bad things happen, and then you're in trouble."
yes. it's a lot of things.
"yes. so, yeah, so, yeah. well, uh-- so when you channel your mom, it helps. you seem to have learned almost. as if there's something like that -"
yes.
-a conversation inside the room. what ideas do you have about what you're gonna do?
"if I'm at school like a teacher, it's going to happen in class."
mm-hmm.
"-I'm just saying, I'd like to go to the bathroom and think about how to leave them. I had a girl in my gym class, and she didn't talk to me for a minute. we play a game of pickle, I don't know if you know."
I'm not sure what the pickleball is.
"-it's like a badminton, a big ping-pong ball."
it's like a ball of pickles?
you're in a big bracket -
isn't there a pickle?
"no, no, no, no"
"all right, all right, all"
"no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,"
I'd like to pickle and stuff.
"mm-hmm. and I should have been like that again. I'm telling you, I've been silent and I'm telling you, I'm not going to my gym teacher. so I'm gonna go with him so I don't have to. and that's what happened."
that's a good decision.
the girls like what they're like.
"yes. if you knew what she was like, something bad would happen to you."
yes. I'd like to hit her in the face or something.
you've known about it.
-or something.
"all right, so, so,. you've known about it. so-so-so-so"
yes.
"you know, actually, the kids-"
"yes, it's like."
-know how to push the buttons.
"yeah, I can't say who's four main ones."
"all right, that's okay. well, 'cause it doesn't matter. the most important thing is to be happy. well, uh--"
"they're like real friends, they're like real friends, they don't really like it."
uh-huh.
"maybe, but they might like it, but they don't really like it. like the girls who like to call themselves friends"
uh-huh.
"-""oh, you really liked that girl."". ""no."" I'm like, ""No."". you know what I mean?"
yes.
"it's kind of annoying, 'cause it's kind of hard to go to high school and know what to believe and who not to believe."
"yes. it's a big unknown territory. there's probably 1,000 kids in the high school."
"yes, one, three, one, two, one"
"it's a thousand kids, so it's a"
"and then there's the sophomores, so it's like 1,000, so it's like -"
"2,000-2,000-2"
yes.
"-potential enemies, friends, who knows what they are."
"yes, because of the rumors, I lost my friend and I lost him because of rumors. it's like what the hell is going on. I've been thinking about it for three months, and I finally just got over him."
it must have been hard for you.
yes.
yes.
you probably just envy me because I've been friends with him.
"mm-hmm. but then, after three months, it was time."
yes.
-and you've got--
"I've just forgotten about it, and I'm like other people."
"all right, all right, all. and so how do you know who your friends are who you can trust?"
"I'm saying the ones who don't like it, but like me a lot, or like me to text me a lot, or like calling. before you had any of those, they helped you with the same situations. they're telling you something and they think you're gonna trust them. as my friend told me everything. she's a good friend because she trusts me."
you're gonna trust her now?
yes.
"all right, all right, all. it's a good thing that people-- it's both good and bad."
mm-hmm.
"you know, I'm thinking of you. and, uh-- so and for you, friends who, uh, they're kind of, uh, they give you attention you want. you're texting me-you're texting me"
yes.
"-you're calling and you're hanging out with you, and you're just pretending to be a friend."
mm-hmm.
-when you think they might--
"yeah, it's a lot with my friends. as far as we were friends, we were friends from fourth grade."
mm-hmm.
"she starts talking like she's lying and talking about me. then you don't have a good friend. since you've been my friend since fourth grade, you're like a friend."
mm-hmm.
"now she's causing a lot of drama. you don't know who to follow, 'cause you're friends from high school, and she came to them like, you don't know who to follow. it's a little annoying because I'm friends with her and she's going to my friends. it's like-"
mm-hmm.
"-get your friends, don't follow me."
mm-hmm. what's not to like about her?
she's just lying a lot and I'm not talking to her like eight years ago. she's just like I'm losing friends because of the drama she starts.
"all right, all right, all. she seems to be."
"no one, no one, no one. I'll tell you that. she's like - - - - - -"
or not worth the effort.
yes.
she's not worth your time. what would you do if you really just spent time with your friends?
I've been with them for a while. I'm hanging out with them a lot.
"all right, all right, all. it's really nice. It's really nice. yes. if you need any help -"
you want to ask him. yes.
"all right, and what do you want them to do?"
"I'm like, if something happens, I'll call them to come to my office, like, if something happens, I'll call them to help me, like, backup information."
"because they're capable of it. they can give you some information, uh, like, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,"
yes.
"all right, so, so, so,. so we're. you know what. you have some really good ideas about how to handle it, and yet kids can be really mean. well, uh, I know it's really bad in high school."
yes.
"I wonder if you'd like to, uh, if you wanted to, we could talk about it. if you want to bring your friends, it's okay."
yes.
so it's something like that.
"yeah, I'm sure there's a friend who would like to talk about it."
yes.
"she's really. she doesn't know who to talk to her mom, 'cause she's not always there."
"all right, all right, all"
and she's like she doesn't know where to go.
yes.
she doesn't know who to believe.
"but I'd like you to have it, Molly."
yes.
"you know, I'd like to see her too."
yes.
she seems to really need someone to listen to her.
yes.
"yes. well, maybe we can talk about other ways of helping, uh, you know, people seem to be, you know, just plain mean to you."
mm-hmm.
"yes. then you'd like to talk about it. all right, all right, all. all right, let's go. Let. I just want to tell you that you're really good at what it is to be in high school, 'cause it's hard."
yes.
it's true. It's true.
I noticed that.
"yes. it's hard, and I-I think it's going to be better. it's a little better for me. you know, freshman year, sophomore year."
mm-hmm.
"but, uh, I'm sure you're beautiful, and I love hearing you say you're involved in swimming and some other things."
yes.
"[unintelligible 00:13:12] people. all right, so what else. no. all right, all right, all. all right, let's go. Let"
mm-hmm.
thank you. Thank you. Thank you
I wanted to talk to you about your handout for clarification of values. I'd like to talk to you about your values and just talk to you a little bit more. do you want to tell me what you think is the best value?
"yes, um, I'm looking for family happiness, that's-"
that's the first one?
"-I'm especially interested in this number one. I'm usually working on a sheet of values, like every two to three months."
mm-hmm.
"-just to see if anything has changed, and every time it's changed."
"oh, my God. so, what's important to you is the family value?"
"yes, I'm sure."
family happiness?
"it's the most important because it's a little lacking, so I'm sure it's important to me."
"all right, all right, all. do you want to talk about it more?"
"yes. well, I'm pretty sure my family hasn't been on the same page, so, like, if we're all on the same page, then I'm pretty sure we won't fall into the middle. because I don't want to change anyone, I'm more present and, uh, just listen and understand my family members, and-and I'm able to say what I feel is important."
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry. even if you think it's important to you, they don't know it."
"yes, I'm sure."
you mean that's what you're saying. yes?
yes.
and you're gonna tell them?
"I'm really interested in what I'm doing, especially now, and I'm really interested in what I'm interested in."
uh-huh.
"well, I'm sure they're different from-"
"all right, all right, all"
-I'm usually picking what I usually pick.
"all right, all right, all"
"well, then I'm saying religion is religion. you lose your faith a little bit, but you don't lose your faith, but you lose your faith a little bit. well, it's just, ""Oh, you've lost your soul, you're the devil."""
uh-huh.
"you know, I'm thinking of you. well, we're all facing these challenges, aren't we. it's all just that I feel like my faith is still there, but it's--"
"all right, so let's go. so, right now, it's important to you to put family values first. you still have a lot of faith in religion, but you're a little worried about losing faith?"
yes. I'm not afraid to say it.
uh-huh.
"you know, I'm thinking of you. once you say it, people will say it's not really."
because they're experiencing it too.
"yes, I'm sure."
"so, you know, it's normal."
I'm sure it's normal.
but sometimes people don't talk about it.
"yes, it's a."
especially in the church.
"when you say something like that, it's like a shock. ""well, we're all going through things we don't know, and."" I'm not saying I'm not on my way, you know. I'm still a little bit of a problem. ""all right, I'm not in this situation, so I'm glad I didn't have to,"" and-"
mm-hmm.
"-but sometimes I feel like, ""Where's God?"""
yes.
"you know, I'm thinking of you"
you seem to be accepting this place now.
"yes, I'm sure."
"well, you know, it's okay with you, and you know it's gonna change."
"yes, I'm sure."
you have a lot of clarifications and explanations of values every time.
mm-hmm.
-so you know it's going to change.
yes.
and you're gonna take it?
"I have accepted it. ""wow,"" I thought I was too focused on the first time I did it."
mm-hmm.
I've done it twice in the last two times.
mm-hmm.
"""what did I read last time?"" I was so focused. you know, I'm thinking of you"
yes.
and I'm just gonna go and I'm gonna-
"yes, I'm sure."
"-and I'm like, ""Wow."" And then I'm like, ""Wow"
I'm really glad you're open to the idea that where you are now isn't necessarily where you're going to be.
"""isn't that normal?"" I thought at first. you know, I'm thinking of you"
mm-hmm.
but I've noticed people are still going through things. I'm going through life. everything will change.
mm-hmm.
"things don't stay the same. you know, you might be here, you might be there, you might be there, you might be there, you might be there, you might be there, you might be there, you might be there, you might be there, you might be"
yes.
"-I've gotten wider, and wider, and wider. so - so - so - so"
"all right, so let's go"
"I'm not gonna change, I'm just filling it up, and then I'm like, ""Okay."""
"all right, let's go. Let"
"all right, so I'm going to focus more on this, than on the unnecessary things in my life."
mm-hmm. do you want to be more in line with your values or do you want to be more like your life?
"as I mentioned, it's kind of, uh, out of place for me, because when I did it, um, as I said, they were important to me."
the other three?
"well, number three was a health problem."
mm-hmm.
"number four is harmony, number five is security."
"the inner harmony, health and security"
"yes, I'm sure."
-and the other three are here?
mm-hmm.
and the two are the happiness of the family?
and religion is important.
"all right, and the three others, inner harmony - I want to see if I can remember them. inner harmony, health and what's the other?"
security.
security.
yes.
"the inner harmony, health and security."
yes.
do you think you don't pay attention to them as much as you'd like?
"""all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right."""
mm-hmm.
but - but - but - but
do you have a lot of time to take care of the first two?
I'm taking a lot of my time with number one.
mm-hmm.
"-and, uh, I've learned about the self-esteem of different ways."
mm-hmm.
-and I'm definitely taking care of others.
"well, uh, uh, uh"
"so, I had a little less time to be happy."
"yes, I'm sure. you took a back seat to the family?"
"yes, I'm sure."
you don't even have a timetable. what does it mean to be in the day. will your family be the majority?
"it's all about me, but it's all about the others."
"all right, all right, all"
"well, uh, I'm not even."
it will be difficult to achieve inner harmony
yes.
-if you're always looking for someone to take care of you.
"first of all, I'm thinking of sleep. I've been a little tired lately."
"all right, so let's go"
"well, uh-hmm, but,"
yes.
"I'd like to go first, but I'm just overwhelmed, but I'd like to regain it, inner harmony, inner peace."
"all right, all right, all"
"I was 18, and I was just so, like, free-spirited, open-minded. I've lived my life, and now I'm like a fairy tale."
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry. mm-hmm."
"""it's not a fairy tale,"" I said, and reality said, ""It's not a fairy tale."". you're on board now. as - as - as - as"
"all right, all right, all"
"""you know, this isn't about you, it's about everyone else."""
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry. so, something really happened to you?"
yes.
you were a little surprised by the fairy tale life.
mm-hmm.
-and what about the rest of it?
yes-
"all right, all right, all"
"-of course, and the shock is just getting stronger."
"all right, all right, all. I really enjoyed talking to you about your values. I hope it's helpful to you, and I hope it will be useful to you in the future, if I can help you in any way."
thank you for listening.
"all right, all right, all. all right, so what do you say. you're welcome. You're welcome."
"Mr. Johnson, what do you say?"
yeah?
I'm here to talk about your cholesterol and your doctor's medication.
I've been talking to my doctor about my medication. it's his job to do it.
"well, I'm also helping you understand how to use your medicine and, uh, I'm helping you to get the best benefits."
"to be honest, I don't know if I'll take the medicine. I know I have high cholesterol, but I have to take it, but on the other hand, it can cause severe muscle weakness. I'm a truck driver and I'm carrying these heavy boxes, and I'm not gonna be able to afford it."
"do you know that if you have cholesterol levels, you're at risk of stroke or heart attack?"
"yes, but in the end-"
"all right, all right, all. the side effects are very rare, they don't really have to worry about them, and stroke or heart attack is much worse."
"I'm concerned about muscle weakness right now, and that's, uh, you know, I have to do my job."
"all right, I-I-I-I-I-I-. well, it's very rare, but it's not. if you have a weakness in your muscles, you'll tell your doctor. it's not permanent, okay. it's not going to affect your job, it's not going to affect your job."
"why don't you give me the medicine, and I'll take it home. but I'm worried about my job."
"you- you really have to take it, and-and like I said, the muscle weakness is rare. if you feel weakness in your muscles, tell your doctor. you can go or you can go. it's not permanent, but it's not permanent"
"sure. all right, all right, all. just. just. just. just"
"it's not permanent, but it's not permanent."
whatever.
"all right. you have a stroke or a heart attack, so you better take your medication as you go, uh, every day to lower your cholesterol."
"all right, I'll take it. all right, all right, all"
"all right, all right, all"
"hello, Kaylie, I'm sorry. I. you seem to be here to pick up the prescription."
yes. he said something to my doctor.
"all right, all right, all. it's probably cholesterol. how do you take the medication?"
"no, I don't think so."
you'll only take it once a day. did he tell you what side effects he expected?
"no, no, no, no"
"well, nausea, vomiting, headache. there are some serious ones like dermatomyositis, liver failure, lupus, rhabdomyolysis, hemorrhagic brain infarction. if you have any of them, call the doctor."
"all right, all right, all. why do I take this medication?"
it's a disease of dyslipidemia. one tablet a day. do you want to ask me something?
"no, I'm guessing not."
"all right, let's go. Let. all right, so let's get. good morning. Happy Birthday."
"hello, Kaylie, I'm sorry. I. you're here to pick up the prescription."
yes. he said something to my doctor.
he seems to have called for cholesterol. how do you take this medication?
"no, I don't think so."
"all right, all right, all. you'll take it every day. did he tell you what side effects he expected?"
"no, no, no, no"
"all right, let's go. Let. there are nausea, vomiting, headache. there are severe side effects, including dermatomyositis, liver failure, lupus, rhabdomyolysis, hemorrhagic, brain damage. if you have any of them, call the doctor."
"all right, all right, all. why do I take this medication?"
it's a disease of dyslipidemia. you'll have one every day. do you want to ask me something?
I guess not.
"all right, let's go. Let. all right, so let's get. all right, have a nice afternoon."
"hello, Kaylie, I'm Lori, the pharmacist. Dr. Ferris has just called you a new cholesterol treatment called 20. I'm wondering if you'd like to talk to me. I'm just gonna make sure you know how best to handle it, and if you have any questions."
sure. I only have a couple of groceries.
"all right, all right, all. what's the cholesterol statin for the doctor?"
he said I had a blood test and I should start taking it.
"he's right. He's right. He. it's designed to lower cholesterol, which means it's going to lower your risk of heart attack or stroke. what did your doctor tell you to do?"
he's not really telling me. he's just calling him.
"all right, all right, all. you take a cholesterol tablet 20 times a day, and you can take it with or without food. when do you take your medication?"
"before I go to sleep, I'll take all my medication. then I guess I'll take it."
"all right, all right, all. it's perfect because cholesterol is best taken at night, but you can take it any time. every day, you have to take it. it's important to keep it up. where's the medication stored?"
I'm taking my medication in the bathroom.
"all right, let's go. Let. do you have a baby in the house?"
"no, no, no, no"
"all right, all right, all. all right, so it seems like a perfect place. the best medicine is stored in a dark and dry place. what's the doctor telling you about the side effects?"
he didn't tell you anything about it.
"all right, let's go. Let. it's pretty well tolerated, so there's not much of a side effect. but you may experience a slight weakness and pain. if you think it's really serious, you should talk to Dr. Ferris. other medicines, even over the counter, can interact with this medicine. before you start with something new, talk to your doctor. in addition, grapefruit juice can affect cholesterol levels 20. I'd probably switch to a different juice if you used grapefruit juice every day."
can you repeat to me what you're gonna do with this medicine?
"sure. I'll take one pill before I go to sleep. I'm going to have a little orange juice. if I see any muscle weakness, I'll call Dr. Ferris immediately."
"all right, Kaylie, it's great. I'm sure we've been through a lot of things today. what else do you want to ask me?"
"all right, I've answered all your questions. thank you. Thank you. Thank you"
"it's great. It's amazing. all right, let's go. Let. all right, here's your prescription. I'll fill it with auto-fill so you can fill it up at the same time every month. if you have any questions, call me at the phone number on the bottle. thank you very much. I'm glad you had a great day."
"hello, Kaylie, I'm sorry. I. I'm Lori, the pharmacist at Bulldog Pharmacy. I'm sure you'll pick up a new medication today. Dr. Ferris called me for cholesterol 20. can I talk to you for a minute. I want to make sure you know how best to take this medicine and answer any questions you might have."
sure. I only have a couple of groceries.
"all right, let's go. Let. what's the cholesterol statin for the doctor?"
he said I should have taken this medication because I had a blood test.
"okay, and he's right. it will lower cholesterol, and it will lower your risk of heart attack or stroke. what did the doctor tell you to do with this medicine?"
"he's just calling me, he's just calling."
"all right, let's go. Let. you take a cholesterol tablet 20 times a day, and you can take it with or without food. when do you take your medication?"
"before I go to sleep, I'll take all my medication. then I guess I'll take it."
"it's perfect. It's perfect. It. it can be taken any time of day, but it's important to take it every day."
where's the medication stored?
I'm in bed by the bed.
do you have kids in the house?
"no, no, no, no. I'm not having kids."
"all right, let's go. Let. it seems like a perfect place to store them. store medication in a dark, dry place."
what did your doctor tell you about the side effects?
he didn't tell you anything about it.
"all right, let's go. Let. it's usually well tolerated, so you don't have any side effects, but you might have a little muscle weakness or pain. if you think it's really serious, you should talk to Dr. Ferris. in addition, the medication may interact with other medicines or other medicines. you should check with Dr. Ferris before you start with something new. last, grapefruit juice can interact with this medication. I'd avoid grapefruit juice while taking this medicine."
do you want to repeat what you're gonna do with this medicine?
"sure. I'll take a statin pill tonight with all my other medication. I'm going to have a little orange juice. if I see any bad muscle pain, I'll call Dr. Ferris immediately."
"that's great, Kaylie. I'm sure we've been through a lot of things today. what's the last thing I want to ask you?"
I'm sure you answered all my questions. thank you. Thank you. Thank you
"okay, okay, so let's go. all right, here's your prescription. you can also put it on autofill so you can have it ready for you every month. if you have any questions, call me at the phone number on the bottle. thank you very much. I'm glad you had a great day."
"hello, Dr. Martin, I'm sorry. I've heard you're asking me a question. what's the point of the conversation?"
"excuse me, but are you a pharmacist. I'm wondering about citalopram."
"yes, I'm a pharmacist on duty. Citalopram, okay. it's a mood stabilizer and it's 10, 20, and 40-milligram. it's excreted in urine for about 35 hours. there are sexual side effects, heart problems, and stomach problems."
"all right, but I'm wondering if phenelzine is involved?"
I think it's okay.
"all right, thanks. I'm supposed to go to work."
"okay, thanks. I'll call you when I have something."
"hello, Mrs. Smith. Hi. Hi. Hi. we'll give Lilly some vaccines at this meeting."
I don't know if I'm comfortable with that. I read a lot of things about them lately.
"well, I'm thinking of something. do you have any concerns about vaccination?"
"well, I just- I've read that immunity is better built up naturally and so on."
"all right, so you thought it might be better to expose Lily to these diseases than using vaccines to help her?"
"yeah, I'm sure. as a kid, I had chickenpox, and now I'm fine. all right, so, so,. so, so, so, so"
"that's right. as a child, you're less likely to have chickenpox as an adult because you've developed a natural immunity. well, I'd like to tell you a little bit about the other vaccines we're gonna give Lily today?"
"all right, all right, all right,"
"all right, all right, all. they often die, sometimes, when they have a natural exposure to these diseases, they have, uh, sometimes fatal, sometimes fatal, sometimes fatal, sometimes fatal, sometimes fatal, sometimes fatal. Polio has caused paralysis in children. it was a little risky, sometimes, to allow children to be exposed to these diseases."
"wow, I didn't realize it was so dangerous. I didn't hear about polio."
"well, I'm thinking of something. you don't know some of the things I've told you. well, I think it's because we've done a good job of eliminating some of these diseases that a lot of people your age and even my age don't know about them. what do you think about the idea of vaccination for Lilly?"
I guess it's okay. I'd like her to be healthy and safe.
"before you make any decisions about her, you must ensure that she is protected and you make good decisions and research."
"yeah, I'm just doing what's right."
"hello, Mrs. Smith, I'm Terri, I'm a nurse who works with Dr. Fields."
"well, I've seen you around. yes, we've met before."
"yes, I'm thinking of last time."
yes.
"I wanted to talk to you about Dr. Fields last time, and I wanted to see how it went with tai chi."
"well, I've been there a couple of times."
uh-huh.
"yes, I was very happy to see the instructor and he was very nice, but I was a little embarrassed because I was still in my wheelchair."
uh-huh.
"I'm sitting in the chair. you know, I couldn't do it."
mm-hmm.
"so, I just felt. I'm just. I'm a little embarrassed."
"uh-huh. you're a little embarrassed because you're in a chair, but you liked the instructor?"
a lot of self-consciousness.
"a lot of self-consciousness, uh-huh."
yes.
"what did you hope to achieve with the, um, the tai chi?"
"as Dr. Fields said, it's good for balance, and I'm still having a problem. I was hoping that I'd be able to take advantage of what they offered. yeah, mostly my balance, mostly my balance."
"uh-huh. you hope it will help balance, but you didn't see the results you were looking for?"
we don't have that yet.
we don't have that yet.
yes.
uh-huh. what's the overall goal of the project. what do you want to do?
I'd like to go home.
uh-huh.
"yes, I'm really doing it."
what's important to you about getting back?
[sighs] Everything. I'd like to go with my dog.
mm-hmm.
"he's really cute, and I'm missing my garden."
yes.
"I'm just missing being independent, I'm going to sleep when I want to sleep and I'm cooking for myself. independence. of course I'm missing the independence."
"uh-huh. you want to go home to your dog, the garden, your life, your freedom?"
"yes, I'm sure."
mm-hmm.
yes.
what's the point of achieving this goal of getting back home?
"they said I'd be able to walk down the hallway and back, even if the walker was secure."
uh-huh.
I'm not there yet.
do you agree that you're going to be able to get home?
yes.
uh-huh.
I'm not gonna fall.
uh-huh.
"I've had a friend who was there. well, I-I agree with a little hesitation, but I agree."
"uh-huh, and tell me how you're doing physical therapy?"
it's better if we do it.
mm-hmm.
it's still hurting me. it's-- I'm better. I'm better. I'm better. I'm better. it's not as bad as it seems.
mm-hmm.
"yes, so-"
"so, you know, you're making some progress in physical therapy."
"yes, I'm sure."
-and you're hoping that the tai chi will help you with the wobble. uh-huh?
yes.
so you're going to go to the martial arts?
"yes, I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I. I don't make much sense, but I do."
uh-huh. I think it's important that you know you have to make a decision about whether or not you want to do tai chi.
"after one time, I don't really know."
uh-huh.
"yes. it's not fair to say it's or not. you know, it's not like that, but you know."
you've yet to see the results you want.
yes.
-but Dr. Fields recommended it and your friend recommended it.
yes.
-and you're really enjoying the teacher-
"yes, I'm sure."
-do you want to try again?
"yes, I'd be happy to."
so what happens when you're going to Tai Chi?
"I-I know that no one is looking at me, but I-I know that no one is looking at me, but I-I know that no one is looking at me, but I-I-I know that no one is looking at"
uh-huh. yes.
"yes, and the arrangement is a little complicated."
"uh-huh. so, how confident are you on a scale of 1 to 10, with one being a little confident and the other a little confident that you can handle it."
can I do it with you?
mm-hmm.
"five, four, three, two"
"five, four, three, two"
yes.
"uh-huh, so-huh, so-"
"I know I can, but it's really hard."
uh-huh. what's the difference between 5 and 1?
I'm doing it myself.
mm-hmm.
"if I could help you, I'd really--"
uh-huh.
"my daughter can't visit often, uh-"
uh-huh.
yes.
would you like some help to make the arrangements so you feel more confident?
I'd be happy to.
uh-huh.
I'd be happy to.
and can your daughter do it?
I'd have to wait a week.
"all right, all right, all. so you want us to help you?"
I'd be happy to.
uh-huh.
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. is it possible that this is true?"
we can do it with the rehab center. they're driving a car.
uh-huh.
-and they've done it for other patients so we can certainly do it if you want.
that's good. That's good. I'd have to do it myself if I felt confident.
"all right, all right, all. so, what obstacles or obstacles are there to your success in Tai Chi?"
I don't think I can think of anything.
"all right, all right, all"
that's the main thing - that's what it is.
"all right, let's go. Let"
-the arrangements for the implementation of the programme
you seem to have made some progress in physical therapy.
"yes, I'm sure."
"you want to give the tai chi another chance, and if we can arrange for you to go to rehab, you'll give it another chance."
that's-- Yes.
"all right, all right, all"
that's true.
"all right, so, um, before you go, I'll call the rehab center and we'll make the arrangements."
you'd like to?
sure. I'm happy to do it.
it would be really helpful.
"then I'll see how you're doing with Dr. Fields, and then I'll see how you're doing with Dr. Fields."
"all right, all right, all"
"all right, let's go. Let"
yes. thank you. Thank you. Thank you
"I'm very glad you came today, Mrs. Smith, and I'm looking forward to hearing about your progress."
"all right, all right, all"
"hello, Dr. Martin, I'm sorry. I'm Lori, and I'm here to. I'm a pharmacist on duty. I'm sure you're wondering about the citalopram medication. can I talk to you about this?"
"well, I'm sure, but a minute."
"all right, let's go. Let. do you have any questions about the matter?"
"nothing specific, nothing specific. I'm not familiar with the medication."
"all right, all right, all. it's a SSRI medication called citalopram. it is usually prescribed as a 20-milligram tablet, but it can be taken as 10, 20, and 40 milligrams. in four to eight weeks, patients should be monitored to see improvement in symptoms."
"all right, all right, all. what about the side effects?"
"there may be a side effect of GI, sedation, or sexual dysfunction. you can try to reduce the dose or change the agent if you have a patient suffering from any of these things. do you have any questions about the other?"
what about the interaction with phenelzine?
I don't know if I'm sure. shall I ask you something later this afternoon?
of course.
it's great. It's amazing. thank you. Thank you. Thank you
thank you. Thank you. Thank you
do you like your parents' way of raising you?
tell me about how your parents raised you?
tell me about how you feel?
"all right, all right, all. I guess I've grown up."
what do you think it's like?
I guess it's a little scary.
are you uncomfortable with changes in your body?
"yes. I-I don't know much about him, but I'm sure there's something."
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
"I'm not calling you yet, but I'm going to see the doctor."
why do you think you're so hesitant to call?
I'm not sure. I'm sure it's overwhelming.
what's so overwhelming about it?
I'm not gonna call the phone and I know I have to fill it out. I'm not sure how to get there and I'm not happy with needles.
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry. you feel overwhelmed or you're just not liking the doctor or the doctor?"
"yes, I'm sure."
how can I help you with this?
can I call you?
"sure, we'll do it together."
shall I go to the meeting with you?
"I'll try it. I'm not sure if I can guarantee you, but we can discuss ideas about who can go with you to support you."
"hello, Rick, I'm sorry. I. hello, welcome."
Kia ora.
I'm glad you're here. I see you have a file on your computer.
yes. that's right.
what's your name?
I'm from the south.
"all right, all right, all right,"
mm-hmm.
in the bottom. on the bluff?
"yes, sir. I'm from Invercargill, just a little farther. my family's still there."
"well, they're here, aren't they. so you've been born here and-"
mm-hmm.
- Is it a place to raise?
"mm-hmm. country boy, I'm a country boy"
"country boy, I'm a country boy. how long have you been in Christchurch?"
I've been here since 18.
so you've been here a long time?
it's just a minute. yes.
"all right, all right, all right. do you have a family?"
"well, I'm just my own."
"you're just here with your whānau. [unintelligible 00:01:51]. well, I'm interested in working with you, you know, you're gonna be working with me for a while. I wonder what you think about your journey today."
"I thought about what you might ask me. I think about my kids, I'm thinking about my job."
"all right, so let's go"
it's a little bitch.
"all right, all right, all. you've been to the prevention service a little bit."
mm-hmm.
what have you been like in the past?
"all right, it was okay. well, it wasn't bad."
"all right, so let's go"
"I'm not sure. it wasn't anything really, really."
"all right, all right, all. did you ever get back to the same kind of bad thing?"
yes.
"I've learned over the years that a lot of guys don't come to the door, and they don't come in, and I'm, uh, you came in. what's the point of this?"
I hope it says I want to change it.
yes.
mm-hmm.
so you came here before?
yes. I've been through those doors so many times.
yes.
"-but, uh, I'm thinking of my kids."
yes. so you really care about them?
yes.
yes. and you're with your kids full-time.
"no, no, no, no. no, I'm not. I'll see them every week."
"all right, all right, all. what do you think it's like?"
it's a shame. It's a
mm-hmm.
yes.
what would you like to do with your kids?
"I'd like to see them whenever I want, whenever I want."
yes.
"you know, I'm thinking of you. I'm the whole world and I've done something wrong."
"all right, so let's go"
"so, you know, it's like that."
"so you're going to do a program with me and you're gonna do a program with me, so what's important to you and your kids?"
it's really important that we do this.
"mm-hmm. if I were to put it on a scale of 1 to 100, 1 being not important, 100 being very important, where would you be?"
"it's, uh, it's hard because I don't have a bad person. I just fucked up, but I'm not a bad guy."
"all right, so let's go"
I'd be 100% for my kids.
"all right, so let's go"
"if I want to, I can-- see my kids whenever I want."
yes. what would your kids be like if they heard you say it was really important to you. you've given it a hundred percent. then what would it be like to hear it?
I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-. but I'd like my kids to see me. but I hope they're proud of me.
"all right, all right, all"
because I'm-- Yeah.
"all right, all right, all. would anyone be proud of you if you took these steps?"
"oh, my mom, I'm sorry."
yes. your mom's still in the south?
yes.
yes. do you know she's here today?
"no, no, no, no"
what if she knew you were talking like that. because this time you really want to change things.
"yes, I'm here."
yes.
"I'm just, uh, I don't know where to start. I'm not sure."
so you think it's a good time to start this program and complete this program?
"I'm hoping so. I'd really like to help myself, I'd really like to help myself. I'm not deliberately trying to fuck things up."
"yes. then we'll do a little bit of work together. well, sometimes it's quite hard. I wonder if there will be a lot of guys who will be released before we go. I wonder if you're one of them?"
"no, I'm really interested in this."
"all right, so let's go"
I'm very important to me.
"all right, all right, all. we're really conscious of the fact that sometimes we work alone. we want to ask who they will be responsible for. I think you're talking to your mom and your friends. who would be supportive of you, and who would you need to let them know you were really going through this program?"
I'm separated from my mom and-
what's the name of your partner?
"oh, my God, Kirsty."
"Krystin, I'm sorry"
"I'd like to do it, but I know she wouldn't really care about it."
"all right, so let's go. would your employer support you?"
"yeah, I'm not sure. maybe, but I don't know if I want to."
"all right, all right, all. what would you like to explore with them?"
"well, I'm not sure."
do you think any of your family members would be supportive?
I'm pretty much alone here.
"all right, all right, all. you know, Rick, it's just, uh, you know, part of the responsibility is to turn up and do the program."
mm-hmm.
the other thing is that we will be accountable to the program when we do it. so who else can we support you while you're going through this?
"well, I'm not sure. I'm not, uh, I'm not, uh, I'm not,"
"all right, all right, all"
"-I'm not sure I can support you. my friends, I love them, but I don't know."
"all right, all right, all. we don't want to fall into the same trough we did last time. next time we're together, I'd like to leave it with you. you might be able to support us, that we-we need to tell you that you will make these changes and this time, you will be supportive. how can you do it with your mother and partner. what do you think it sounds like?"
"all right, let's think about it."
I feel like you're kind of padding this walk a little bit. is that true?
yes. it's definitely true.
your family's in the south. who would really like to support you if you wanted to go?
I'm really good with my mom.
"all right, all right, all"
-with my sisters and brothers.
yes.
mom is really important to me.
"yes. if you were to tell your mom, you'd say it's important for you and that you should do it for her and for the family. what's going to be like to hear it?"
she would be proud of me.
"yes. all right, let's go. Let"
yes.
"brother and sisters, if you're going to go, it would be very supportive?"
"yes. yes. a nice, uh, nice family."
"all right, all right, all. how do you get them to support you, to come to work, and to be accountable to doing it?"
"well, I'm not sure. well, someone just wants to listen."
"if she were here with us, what would your mom want to tell you if she were here with us?"
she'd say she loved me. she said she believed I could do it.
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry. what would she want for your kids?"
they can look up to their father.
I feel like you want it too.
it's what I'm looking for. of course.
"so, where do you think your confidence level is now?"
I'd say it's higher if I had their support. I've known I've fucked him up in the past. I'd be 100% sure if they were there to support me.
"it's a big step up, right. it's going to be really important for us to get our family on board."
yes.
what do you know about the flu shot?
"well, I know it can be a little bad, but I'm pretty healthy, so I don't really have to. well, it's just for the old ones, right?"
so you think it's just for people who are vulnerable to disease?
yes.
I'd like to share some information about the flu vaccine and the importance of it with you?
"all right, all right, all"
"you know, you're young and healthy and you don't have a lot of complications that mean you'd be fine if you got the flu. but we know that the elderly are more likely to be affected, pregnant women, children, and by you getting vaccinated, they're more likely to be affected."
"all right, all right, all"
how do you feel about the idea of vaccination?
the grandparents probably wouldn't be able to handle the flu.
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
-and my co-worker's pregnant too.
mm-hmm.
"I guess so, yeah, I'd like to."
"all right, so you have a vulnerable person in your life who may be affected by a disease, and you can protect them by taking a flu shot."
yes.
"hello. Hi. Hi. Hi. you're Julie Thompson, right?"
mm-hmm. yes.
"hello, I'm Bruce Berger. I'm working in the clinic and, uh, I noticed you were taking Sarah's rescue inhaler."
mm-hmm.
-because she had asthma. last year she was in the emergency room five times. what was it like for you?
"it was really hard. I'm sorry, but I'm sick of her coughing. when she's gone, I'm really worried. it's really hard when I'm taking her."
you seem to want to try to prevent it from happening.
mm-hmm. yes.
"all right, all right, all. I've been noticing that you've been taking her medication for a couple of months."
mm-hmm.
do you have any problems with this?
"I've been researching the chronic inhaler and I found out there's steroids in it. I've done some research on the possible side effects and some of the health problems that can occur when taking steroids. I'm not gonna expose them to her. all right, so I'm gonna lay it out right now. I smoke, but I'm sure it will come up. but I'm sure I won't smoke around her so I'm sure she won't affect her. so-so-so-so"
"all right, all right, all"
-I'm just saying that right now.
you seem to care about Sarah a lot. you're not interested in using steroids. you worry about what she's gonna do to her and you're working hard to keep her out of her asthma.
mm-hmm. yes.
"all right, all right, all. you know, I'm sure you'd like to talk about the chronic inhaler and the medicine you're concerned about, you know, I'm sure you don't want her to use a steroid. uh, can we talk about it a little bit?"
yes.
"all right, all right, all. well, even though this medicine isn't the same as the steroids you're worried about, and they're called anabolic steroids."
"all right, all right, all"
that's what people build up and masculinize.
mm-hmm.
"if I can draw an analogy - even though this medicine is in the same family as the big broad-broad family. you know, grape is a fruit, and watermelon is a fruit, and grape is much smaller than a watermelon. if you eat one grape, you'll be fine. you can get sick of a whole watermelon. the grape is a medicine that your daughter takes, so it's a very small dose. well, even if it's in the same family, it's not an anabolic steroid. the drug actually reduces the inflammation in your daughter's lungs. and-and it's not even absorbed into the body. it's just her lungs. as I said, I'm not interested in taking medication that could affect those anabolic steroids. it's really safe for your daughter. what do you think about the possibility of using her?"
"well, I-I guess I didn't realize they weren't the same thing as anabolic steroids."
mm-hmm.
the ones who cause all the problems. if you can assure me that there won't be any of the same side effects and health problems -
"of course, I wouldn't. you probably saw the name corticosteroid and thought, ""Oh, my God."""
yes.
"you know, I'm thinking of you. yes, and that's what it's about. I'm not worried about the same kind of medication as you're worried about, but I'm sure it's not the same kind of medicine."
"all right, all right, all"
can I talk about what your daughter's lungs look like when she's having a lot of lung problems?
yes.
"all right, all right, all. when someone has asthma, they have a hypersensitivity. if you had a skin burn on your arm, if someone touched you, it wouldn't bother you. but when the skin burns, you react. she has a sensitive lung. um, if the skin on your hand burns. what's the drug doing for you. it reduces inflammation in her lungs so she doesn't have to be so sensitive. otherwise, everything in the air is like dust, pollen, uh, and it's not going to affect us."
"all right, all right, all right,"
it's really going to prevent this chronic inhaler. all right. that's why it's so important to use it.
mm-hmm.
"unfortunately, even though you smoke, you can also affect her lung and cause her to smoke. if you use a chronic inhaler every day, she may not be sensitive to smoke, but she may still be sensitive to her lung. you know, I'd like to see you quit smoking too, you know, because, you know, it's not really good for you."
yes.
"well, it's definitely going to help her. um, but what I'd like you to do is, kind of, keep an eye on what happens when she uses a chronic inhaler. if she's still flaring up when you're around her, if there's smoke in the clothes, she can flare."
even if I'm just wearing my clothes?
yes. yes.
she's sensitive about it. if I'd known that -
"it's-it's-it's-it's-it. you don't have to worry about it, but you'll have to keep an eye on her. of course, it's best if you don't smoke, or you'll be in the dress."
"all right, so let's go. well, it's a pretty daunting thing to think about quitting smoking."
mm-hmm.
"you know, people try to quit, but it's really hard. I'm sure it would be better -"
"it's very hard. it's very soothing, and-"
yes.
and-and it's hard to replace him.
"yes, it's true. well, uh, uh, uh"
"so, uh, if you don't want to quit, what do you think you could do to help?"
"well, if I only smoked when she was at school, and then changed my clothes before she came home, I thought it was on my clothes. would it help you?"
"it would be great if you could. of course, don't smoke in the house."
absolutely. I've never done it. never mind. I'm not interested
"well, so, yes. it would help if you were willing to do it."
"all right, all right, all"
"well, if you're willing to quit for both of you, we'd be happy to help you. it's not easy to do."
yes. [chuckles]
"all right, all right, all"
it's really hard to do this.
you're willing to use her chronic inhaler-
mm-hmm.
"-to try to get the inflammation down so she doesn't have to go to the hospital and do what you can to keep the smoke out of her clothes. you know, I think she'll be able to go to the emergency room, and you'll probably not need to use the rescue inhaler."
really?
you'll get the inflammation down.
it's great-
"all right, all right, all"
-because it's always scary when she's using it.
yes. so we're ready for both of those prescriptions.
"all right, all right, all"
"every day, use a chronic inhaler, keep the rescue inhaler in the bag. well, let's see how it goes."
"all right, all right, all"
all right?
it's going to be good. thank you. Thank you. Thank you
"all right, let's go. Let. all right, all right, all"
"hello, Sal. Hi, Sal. thank you for coming."
it's not a problem. It's
I'm really glad you came to the appointment and I really appreciate you taking the time to make the appointment.
"I guess it's a little inconvenience, but I'm here."
you've done it here - you've done it here.
mm-hmm.
- and what did the doctor worry about you about?
"I'm thinking of changing my life even more. the smoking has changed, and now it's, you know, it's a little bit of a drink, a little bit of a cigarette, a little bit of a cigarette. I'm not sure what else I should do."
"so you have asthma, and you have a lot of things, right?"
"well, there's a lot of stress too. she's still on maternity leave, she doesn't have a job, she's with the baby. I only work here, and I'm changing everything that's going on in my life."
mm-hmm. almost - almost - almost - almost
"yes, it's a lot."
it seems almost impossible.
"yes, yes, yes, it's overwhelming. it's true. It's true."
"I guess we'll be together for about fifteen or twenty minutes, and I'm wondering if we'll be able to look at all the different things that happen to you and maybe you'll see them."
"everything seems to be over, but I guess we'll start somewhere."
"all right, all right, all. it's a workbook and it's a workbook-it's a workbook-it's a workbook-it's a workbook-it's a workbook-it's"
mm-hmm.
"what would you list all the things people around you say you should do or change. it doesn't mean you have to change them, Sal."
"all right, all right, all"
"you're in the driver's seat, so it's just to put all the cards on the table."
"all right, all right, all. all right, that's good. as long as we don't change anything, I guess we'll just put pen to paper."
"yes, I'm sure."
"all right, so I have asthma."
"all right, so asthma is one."
yes.
what else?
"that's my dog, Oscar."
the dog and the doctor say the dog is.
he says it's a main cause of asthma.
"all right, all right, all"
"I'm not gonna buy it, but I'm not gonna let him go like that, but it's something I can't just get rid of."
it's a shock to hear you have to get rid of your dog.
yes. the dog's been here before my wife. I've known it's been longer.
"well, I'm thinking of something. so you're really stressed out right now?"
"yes. it's a big stress, it's like my best friend. I guess I'll cut the last cigarette I've been working on."
"all right, so you want to smoke and I want to quit smoking?"
it's a problem with finances.
"all right, so money."
"I have to go to all the meetings and I'm taking a break, which is obviously money, right?"
"all right, so let's go. all right, all right, all right,. so the meetings and the time."
mm-hmm.
I think we've seen a little bit of each other.
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. yes, there's something going on. well, I have to cut my drinking too."
"all right, so, wow. so there's a lot of things going on, Sal. anything else you're worried about?"
"no, no, no, no. you know, it's just overwhelming when you see everything."
"all right, so let's go. so where would you start with something like a high priority or something to talk about this morning?"
"I'm definitely thinking about the dog, that's what I'm thinking."
"all right, all right, all"
"well, I have asthma too. so maybe they're two."
"all right, and those are the ones that are pretty closely related to each other."
mm-hmm.
"- It seems like it's going to be. all right, all right, all"
"I'm sure you have asthma symptoms. so, we're going to look at some of the ways you can be healthy and not be back."
"mm-hmm. I'm definitely not going back. the doc said Oscar, my dog, was connected to asthma. but the - but the - but the"
yes.
"it's a problem for 12 years, and now it's a problem."
"you're a little surprised. I'm sure you've seen the material that-that the clinic gave you about asthma and asthma management, and pets are a big problem."
"I saw the materials, I've seen them, I've seen them."
mm-hmm.
"-I've read them. I only took the medicine. well, I'm not really familiar with this."
"wait a minute, Sal, what do you mean you-you- you- you- you- you- you- you- you- you- you- you- you- you- you- you- you- you- you- you- you"
yes.
"-a new baby, a new baby."
"yes, John Carlo."
"you're very concerned about your health, you want to take care of your baby and you've almost stopped smoking."
mm-hmm.
"-that's great. It's great. so, the dog is really important, the dog is important to us. it's going to be hard. but there's always someone who will adopt the animal. I'm sure there's someone from your family or friends."
"I'm a little tired of this. first of all, John Carlo is taking care of him. it's okay. It's okay. It. the dog doesn't have asthma. it's just me and you. I'm not gonna do it - I'm not"
"I'm worried about you, Sal. I'm worried about you, okay. the symptoms are worse. you had a couple of asthma attacks. and-and that's a risk to your life that there's a lot of adults with severe asthma who can die, and that's why they're dying. it's really something to take very seriously. I'm not gonna stress it enough."
"so, Oscar's gonna kill me. the doctor says, ""Oh, I don't know if it's stress, money, or alcohol."". so what do we say Oscar can kill me. I've been with him for 12 years."
"Sal, what, uh, you know what asthma is, it's gotten worse in the last six years. you know, the medication is stronger and stronger, and it's only a matter of time before the medication is used. you know, I'm thinking of this."
I'll keep taking more medicine and I'll keep Oscar.
"Sal, you're the strongest one. if Oscar is important to you, then you're gonna put Oscar higher than your wife. well, uh, that's not what I mean. do you understand what it's important to me?"
"I'm sure you understand, but I don't think I'm in it. I've been with him for 12 years. when I don't know if it's the main thing, I won't go to my house."
"all right, all right, all right, all"
Barbara Roberts?
"yes, I'm sure. good morning. I'm sorry."
"hello, I'm here."
"hello, hello, hello, hello"
"I'm Dr. Betty, and I'm here to help. I'm a new doctor in the field. first of all, what do you want me to call you?"
you're going to call me Barbara. it's okay. It's going to be fine. thank you. Thank you. Thank you
"all right, that's okay. all right, all right, all. Barbara, I saw you today, but I think it's usually Dr. Brown, right?"
"yes, I'm Dr. Brown's doctor."
"all right, all right, all. what's the reason you're here today?"
"well, I came here for a problem with my belly. I have a terrible stomach and Dr. Brown doesn't seem to be able to solve it. I thought maybe I'd come to see if you could help."
"all right, let's go. Let. all right, all right, all. do you have a problem with your stomach?"
"well, I-I'm suffering from terrible pain almost every day. it's often a bloated feeling. I'm a constipated man, I have diarrhea. sometimes I feel a little cramp, and sometimes I'm a little sore. it's a really painful feeling. I'm often tempted to go to the bathroom and I'm often smelling the smell."
"all right, let's go. Let. well, there's a lot of symptoms there-"
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
- and some of them are sounding-
"yes, I'm sure."
- It's a little difficult for you.
"yes, I'm sure."
"all right, all right, all. how long have you been doing this?"
"I've been looking for him for four years in Egypt. I've had a terrible disease and diarrhea, and I don't think I've had a good stomach."
"mm-hmm. all right, all right, all. all right, all right, all. so you've been thinking about this for four years?"
"yes, I'm sure. yes, I'm sure."
"all right, all right, all. what have you tried to do before?"
"at the beginning, Dr. Brown gave me a muscle relaxant."
mm-hmm.
"well, I went to the health store and-and they were very helpful. they gave me a lot of different pills and medicines."
"all right, so let's go"
"- For different things. no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,"
"all right, so let's go"
I'm carrying Immodia in my handbag all the time. yes.
"all right, so let's go. so, you have different tablets from the-"
"well, I'm thinking of something"
- the herbal shop - the shop with herbs -
"well, I'm thinking of something"
- How do you feel about them?
"well, I don't have the same problem every day."
"all right, so let's go"
"- and I'll take a couple of pills for certain, uh, symptoms."
"all right, so let's go"
- Other pills for something else.
"so, I- I think you might decide on a day-to-day basis."
"well, I'm thinking of something"
what you're gonna take- what you're gonna take-
"well, I'm thinking of something"
- What do you think your stomach is doing?
yes.
"all right, all right, all. all right, all right, all. what about the tests. did you ever have a test on these problems?"
I've had a gastros-gas. what are they called?
a gastroscopy.
"that's what it is. yes, I'm sure."
you're going down the tube?
"yes, I'm sure. yes."
"all right, all right, all"
"um, I also had a barium enema."
"all right, so let's go"
it was a little uncomfortable.
"all right, all right, all"
"well, I tried-- I didn't think he'd try to do it, but he said after that, he didn't try to do it."
"all right, so let's go"
-and he's not sending me anymore. now it's all over-
"all right, so let's go"
- as far as he's concerned. I'm going to the doctor's house.
"all right, so let's go. you seem to be unhappy with that."
"I think the NHS is running out of money, right. and he's-and he's-and"
"all right, so let's go"
- I decided I had enough tests.
"all right, so let's go"
"if you're on the Internet, you know,"
mm-hmm.
he could send me a lot of tests.
"all right, so let's go"
I'd go private if I had a little money.
"all right, so let's go"
he doesn't have to go to the bottom.
"all right, so let's go. you think it's enough, right?"
"no, he's not. he could do more. I'm sure."
"all right, so let's go. all right, all right, all. you've been in trouble for four years."
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
you have a lot of symptoms in your stomach.
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
"you tried a lot of pills. some prescribed, some herbal remedies-"
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
"- you've done some investigations, but you don't really like it."
yes.
it's about- It's about- It's about-
"I'd say so, yes."
- if I'm right about the story.
"yes, I'm sure."
"all right, all right, all. Barbara, how do you feel about this. how does it affect your life?"
"well, it's quite a big impact. I guess the biggest thing is that I've been working full-time for a while, and then I've been working part-time."
mm-hmm.
I've been sitting around all day.
"all right, so let's go"
"well, I've been working part-time, but I've been working for a year."
"all right, so let's go. all right, so let's go"
"I'm missing it, I miss it."
"all right, so let's go"
I'm missing the girls. we've been there for at least a week.
"all right, so let's go"
for pictures or for a drink. that's what it is.
it seems like you enjoyed it.
"yes, so I'm-- Yes. we've had a little fun."
"all right, so let's go. all right, all right, all"
I've been to the swing and the shape. I've been to a training course.
mm-hmm.
"- actually, I'm missing the exercise. well, I've done it for a week, but I'm not really comfortable with it. I've always been worried I'm gonna be taken away."
"all right, so let's go"
we went out for dinner with my husband.
mm-hmm.
we're not doing that anymore.
"all right, so let's go"
"well, uh, mm. yes, it's a lot of things."
you've changed your life in the last few years -
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
- It's a lot because of these symptoms.
"yes, I'm sure."
you seem to be reviewing things you've done.
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
"all right, so let's go"
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
so what would you do for the day?
"well, I'm going to the house-"
mm-hmm.
- I'm probably a little too much of a watch. I have to say I'm a little hooked on television.
mm-hmm.
"they're drawing you in, aren't they?"
of course they do.
"well, I've read a little bit of it."
mm-hmm.
"- the magazines, but, uh, I'm usually at home."
"all right, so let's go"
yes.
"all right, all right, all. all right, all right, all. did you notice any significant changes in your symptoms over the last four years. for example, have you ever been better for something?"
"well, my son's got a wedding last year."
"all right, so let's go"
- I-I'm afraid I won't be able to handle it.
mm-hmm.
"I-I'm not feeling well, but I'm pretty good, and I think it was three weeks in the summer, so I was pretty good."
mm-hmm.
- and the whole wedding.
mm-hmm.
but I'm really good at it. yes.
"all right, so let's go"
it was a good time.
"all right, so let's go. then how did you get the stomach pain?"
I'm not really noticing them.
"all right, so let's go. all right, all right, all"
"yeah, it's, uh, it seems to be, uh, it's going to be."
"all right, so let's go. all right, so let's go"
that was good. It was good.
"all right, so let's go. it's interesting that you're talking about it"
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
do you have any of your symptoms. do you think it's really bad?
"well, I-I-I have a little bad patch."
"all right, so let's go"
"it's especially uncomfortable for me. when my husband is gone, I'm noticing it. he's a little bit of a"
"all right, so let's go"
"he's traveling with his job, and he's-"
"all right, so let's go"
- It's going to be a couple of times a month.
uh-huh.
"well, I have to say, it's not very often."
"all right, so let's go. so when your husband isn't there, it's a little worse. all right, all right, all"
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry. when he's not there, I'm thinking a little bit more."
"all right, so let's go. for the last couple of years, you've seen Dr. Brown."
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
what's the thing he said he might be wrong about?
"well, he thinks it's all in my head."
"all right, so let's go"
he says it's stress.
"all right, so let's go. all right, all right, all"
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
what do you think about this?
"well, I don't think it's all in my head. I'm too much of a physical pain."
"all right, so let's go"
- It's in my head. it's true. It's really true. it's really painful.
mm-hmm.
um - - - - - -
do you have any ideas about what you think might be causing it?
"well, I-I thought maybe it was a disease that hadn't been cured."
mm-hmm.
"- I mean, I think it's a little bit of IBS. my friend's got it, and it's like that."
"all right, so let's go"
"- I'm thinking, ""I wonder if it's a tumor."""
"all right, so let's go"
I'm starting to think of cancer on a bad day.
"all right, so let's go"
last year my mother-in-law died of cancer.
mm-hmm.
- the doctor's not investigating.
"all right, so let's go"
"but when they found him, it was a football-size."
"oh, my God."
- and then it was too late.
"all right, so let's go. all right, so let's go"
"well, I'm going to sleep tonight, and I'm just gonna make sure there's nothing else going on."
"all right, so let's go"
"well, I'm worried about it, too."
you-you-you-you-you-you-you-you-you-you-you-you-
"yes, I'm sure."
do you feel anything?
"yes, I'm sure."
"all right, so let's go"
"you know, I just want to make sure there's nothing going on down there."
"all right, so let's go. all right, all right, all"
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
"all right, all right, all. you know, you've seen Dr. Brown a couple of years ago."
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
you tried a lot of medicines-
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
"- some prescribed, some-"
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
- from the herbal shop. none of them really made a difference. you have some investigations - you have some investigations.
mm-hmm.
- but maybe you don't feel like you've done enough. you're worried about something like a-
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
- a tumor. I have-I have the-I have the-I have
"yes, I'm sure."
"- Yeah, it's a story, right"
"yes, I'm sure. yes."
"all right, all right, all"
I'd say so.
"all right, all right, all. Barbara, what did you hope I'd do for you today?"
"you're a new doctor, aren't you?"
mm-hmm.
"- You've been trained in medicine. I'm wondering if you know, with a new look and a new perspective on the problem-"
"all right, so let's go"
"- you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,"
"all right, so let's go"
maybe you'll send me a different test.
"all right, so let's go. all right, so let's go. you're hoping I'll send you a little more?"
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
"all right, all right, all"
I think there's something that a test might-
"all right, so let's go"
- It might be revealed.
"all right, so let's go. all right, all right, all. I don't think it would be the best thing to do, Barbara, if we were to send you for more tests at this point, I don't think it would be the best thing to do. and that's because you've had a couple of years of major investigations, and they didn't show anything. you don't really change your symptoms. if we're sending you for more tests now, it's unlikely that they'll show anything different than what we already know. you don't have to go for more tests, so I guess it's a waste of time."
then what do you think is in my head. you're going to be like Dr. Brown. do you think I'm imagining it?
"no, no, no, no, no. you have pain, and you have a lot of physical symptoms, and they're clearly affecting you."
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
-your life and your life-
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
"-of disability, of disability."
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
I guess- I guess it's not just about the mind or the body.
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
sometimes it's going to be a combination. I guess I'm thinking about how you told me last year when your son got married.
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
- and you're quite happy that your symptoms have diminished.
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
"well, sometimes, when your husband is away, you feel a little better, but sometimes, you feel worse. Barbara, I wonder if there's a link between how you feel in your head and what you feel in your life, and how much you're suffering from symptoms. do you think it's possible?"
I'm not gonna cause such pain to my mind.
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry. I don't mean you have a headache. well, I guess what I'm saying is that sometimes the way we feel and the way we live can affect how we see symptoms. with all that we tried to do, and we tried to investigate, and we didn't really help you-"
"no, no, no, no"
- I'm wondering if you might want to try a different approach to your problems now.
what kind of approach?
"I mean, you've changed your life in the last four years, so I guess you've changed your life a little bit. it seems like he's really shrunk."
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
you don't seem to be doing much of what you used to do. you're-you're-you're
"no, no, no, no"
- I used to enjoy it. so you're saying it's okay?
"well, I'm not going to do it."
yes.
I'm not gonna do it anymore.
"yes. I wonder if what happened is that you dropped the things you thought you couldn't do, but I wonder if it's a funny thing."
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
- I don't like the way you live. and-and I'm wondering if that's going to make you worse.
I'm not sure.
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
I'm not sure.
"I guess what I'd like to ask is what you think about your life and what you're doing with your life, and maybe try to bring back some of those pleasant feelings."
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
"- once a week with your friends, and if you're doing it-"
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
- You'll improve your quality of life. I also think about the pills you take.
mm-hmm.
"the fact that you seem to take a lot of them, and I wonder if it's worth it, and I'm wondering if you're thinking about it, and-and maybe try to rationalize them a little bit, and really decide which one."
"well, I'm thinking of something. yes."
"what if you tried a slightly different approach for a couple of months, just to see if it would change anything?"
"it's a long time if there's something going on. you know, my mother-in-law was like that."
"all right, so let's go"
they left her and-
mm-hmm.
- I didn't see him and.
"well, if we're working together like that-"
mm-hmm.
"- I'll see you regularly in this new way. if symptoms change, we can keep an eye on them, and if they change, we can investigate accordingly. but if they're the same, then we're-"
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
- We know there's nothing new about it-that we don't.
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
what would it sound like?
"so, uh, what do you say. should I come back and see you?"
I'd say that would be a good idea. we only started talking about it -
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
"- and then maybe you should think about it and then maybe you'll come back. maybe if you're booked for a double slot next week, and that would give us a good chunk of time to think about this new approach."
mm-hmm.
"maybe we can also take your tablets or list them, or maybe we can go from there. what would it sound like, Barbara?"
"all right, all right, all. well, uh, next week, I'll be in charge of the appointment."
yes.
come see you again-
"yes, I'm sure."
- And what do you want to talk about?
"yes, I'm sure. I'm sure."
"all right, all right, all"
it would be a good start.
"all right, let's go. Let. I'll list the tablets I take."
yes.
I'm not gonna drop all the bottles.
"all right, all right, all. all right, let's go. Let"
"all right, all right, all. all right, let's go. Let. I'll do it."
"next week, will you come?"
"next week I'll have an appointment. yes, I'm sure."
"all right, all right, all. all right, let's go. Let. thank you, Barbara."
"all right, all right, all. thank you. Thank you. Thank you"
good-bye. Good-bye. Good-
"the Minnesota State Department of Public Safety reported that you were stopped on Stadium Road last Friday, and then you were taken to a detox facility. besides, you're 21 years old. is the report accurate?"
I guess I'm not really remembering much. I've been drunk for a week.
"all right, all right, all. you might be suspended for this, right?"
"well, I'm thinking of something. well, not really. in a couple of months, I'll be 21. the cops won't give me a minor, like, like, like my friends or something. I'm not gonna be wasted. well, I'm just gonna have to be careful. I'm not gonna catch him. I just want to find a normal student."
you could have caused an accident and killed someone after six beers.
"whatever, I'm not sure. I'm calling my roommate for a ride. he's asleep. He's asleep. He. so I'm going home. it's not my fault. I've been taking him to the car, but I didn't do anything."
"you're responsible for what you do. you'll only get worse if you're still partying. you will face costly legal proceedings, poor grades, health problems. they kicked me out of school and I'm disappointed in my parents. you're not gonna do it, are you?"
"no, no, no, no, no. as I said, it's not my fault. like, we're done here. I'll be in class in fifteen minutes."
"you don't have the Minnesota University's students in your behavior. you'll need to show you can follow our rules if you want to be a student. you're thinking about it, so you're going to suspend me?"
I'm really enjoying the [unintelligible 00: 02: 29] and I'm listening to what you're saying. you're really good points and I'll think about it. all right?
"all right, all right, all. you'll be on probation for a semester and you'll have to attend a seminar on alcohol. in addition, disciplinary action is cumulative and cumulative, meaning that any further violations will lead to a suspension for a semester or longer."
"$150, you're serious about that. I'm not paying you. okay, I'm done with it. I'm done with it."
"hello, Mike. Hi, Mike. Hi. I'm Kathy, I'm a woman. I'm glad you came today."
"hello, Kathy, I'm glad you're here."
"you know, I'm sure there's a lot of places you'd rather be, but, um, you're here, and, uh, thanks."
"all right, all right, all"
"well, first of all, I'd like to ask you how you're doing. if you're okay, I want to make sure you're okay. because, uh, your security is very important. so, if I could ask you a few questions-"
sure.
"-then it's okay, right?"
absolutely. yes.
"-um, we-we-we-we-we-we-we-we-we-we-. I've been thinking about that."
"yes. I've been driving, uh, I'm driving, uh, I'm driving, uh, I'm driving."
"oh, my God. all right, all right, all right,. you've ever felt bad or sick, or something like that."
"no, I'm fine. yes, yes, yes,"
"you're okay, I'm fine. all right, all right, all right,. if you drank last time, I wanted to make sure you drank."
I drank alcohol for the last time.
"yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,"
"well, I guess I'm here because my lawyer wants me to take a look at the assessment."
sure.
"he said I should come here and, uh, I don't know what he meant, but he said I should tell the truth."
"all right, all right, all right,. all right, I'm glad you appreciate it."
yes.
"if you need any information, please, um, feel free to ask. he asked you to come because of blood alcohol levels of 2.8."
"all right, all right, all"
"so, um, you were legally beyond the limit."
"it's bad, or is it too much?"
"well, it's high, uh, you know, they."
"all right, all right, all"
"for driving, for driving."
"all right, all right,"
"he-he did, um, when you blew two eight, he-he-he did. he-he-he did."
"yes. he was, really, really scared. he's-- he's-- he's"
did he freak out. yes-yes.
"he was a little over the top, but, you know, whatever."
"all right, all right, all right,. if you don't mind, I'll ask you a few questions. so, um, you've been drinking for two weeks?"
"yes, I'm sure."
"yes. all right, all right, all. how much did you drink that night?"
"it was a birthday party, and, uh, I drank too much, but, uh, I drank too much. I'm just, uh-- I've been wrong about a lot of things. I'm not supposed to be driving that night."
"all right, so let's go. yes. you know, I drank a lot."
"well, I don't really remember. I'd say, maybe five or six drinks, I'd say."
"mm-hmm. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,"
"yes, they were a little bigger. I'm not really counting, so I don't really know."
"all right, all right, all right,. so, I'm supposed to be five or six guests."
maybe five or six. yes.
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. and-and, what's the drink, right?"
"um, the absolute vodka is the best."
"well, I'm thinking of something"
-and seven times. yes.
"all right, all right, all right,. you said it's about five or six. how often do you use it. you've said it's not a-"
yes.
-you don't drink that much?
"when I drank, I was a little drunk, you know, when I drank, I was a little drunk. I'm really bad for driving."
"all right, so let's go. yes. well, you're usually not drinking much. how much do you drink. just-- just-- just-- just"
"I drink a little bit, you know, maybe one or two, and then I'm not drinking anymore. so, it's not really a pattern."
uh-huh-huh-h
"-you know, it's not a habit, you know,"
"all right, so let's go"
"I don't think I'd consider myself a drinker. you know, I'm sorry about that, but I was wrong."
"all right, so let's go. so, it's not going to be a problem for you-"
"no, no, no, no, no"
-every day.
absolutely not. mm-mm.
"all right, so let's go. it's good. It's good. It's good"
yes.
when did you start thinking about when you drank alcohol?
"I don't know, I didn't have a moment. I-I'm not really clear about the question. I mean, I don't drink, so I don't know--"
"so, that's what it is - that's a question that's even relevant?"
yes.
"all right, all right, all"
yes.
it's okay. It's okay. It
yes.
"it's okay. It's okay. It. all right, all right, all. so, what about the first DUI, what about it. you've been here for a second?"
yes.
if that's what it was like to be a--
I tend to get in trouble when I drink more than a couple of drinks. I've been in trouble twice since I've done it. [crosstalk]
it's been like that for the last two times. yes.
"yeah, pretty much. I know, it's. It's kind of weird, but."
it's a bad sign.
yes. the bad luck thing has been my whole life.
yes.
but the alcohol is not really.
"all right, all right, all right,"
yes.
but that's just a bad luck?
yes.
yes. it's a bad luck or just--
it seems like it. yes. it's definitely true.
"yes. all right, all right, all right,. so what do you think about it. the-- Is there any other time when you thought alcohol was there, and then you were lucky, or it was just the two times?"
"I don't really drink too much, uh, I'm not really. I don't drink too much. well, I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I"
mm-hmm.
"I drink normally, I drink a little bit, and then I'm done. you know, it wasn't something that was a problem for me, you know."
"all right, all right, all right,. all right, all right, all right,. and-and so, where do you usually drink. is it at home or, uh, out-of-work, social drinking?"
"well, normally it's a social thing."
mm-hmm.
"yes. it's usually a social thing. you know, I usually drink more than one or two, but I'm usually drinking more than one."
mm-hmm.
"you know, I'd probably just call a cab. I'd be fine if I didn't have this problem."
would it help you?
I guess it would help. I'd like to work on that.
"so, you seem to have thought about ways to-to get around safely."
yes. I'm sure I'll be staying too. I'd probably stay home if I wanted to drink.
you've been thinking a lot about this.
"yeah, a little bit."
"all right, all right, all right,"
"of course, because I'm not. you know, I'm not. I don't like to be in trouble, and I don't."
there's no fun in trouble.
yes.
"no, no, no, no"
yes.
"yes. tell me a little bit more about when you think you might be, and then you might be thinking of something else, like- like, when you're in the car, you might be thinking of something else."
"when I drink, I'm not going to the car. that's-- Yes. I'm not gonna do it again."
what's different about this?
I'm not interested in losing my license.
"well, I'm thinking of something"
I'm not interested in losing my license.
"wow, that's really cool. you have to have a license-"
yes.
"-to get out of here. you're working for work, you need a license."
"well, I'm also selling cars, so."
"oh, my God."
"-um, I don't want to lose my job. I think they would be linked."
mm-hmm.
"you don't call me a job, do you?"
"no, no, no, no"
"all right, all right, all right,"
"no, no, no, no, no. that's-- that's-- that's"
"all right, let's go. Let"
"you'd have to do it yourself, um, to-to."
"all right, all right, all. I'm not sure how it works."
"no, no, no, no, no"
"you know, if they found out, I might be in danger of my job. so. so. so. so"
"all right, you're here. and-and-and I'll give you credit. when someone talks about security, which I hear you say, um, calling a cab or staying at home, it's a lot of work."
yes.
so what do you think it's going to be like to stay home. you've been talking about drinking at the event. would you stay home?
"you know, I might have a little drink on the Super Bowl, you know."
mm-hmm.
"you know, I'd rather go to my house instead of going somewhere else."
you'd be able to do it?
"yes, I'd say it's a smart thing. you know, I don't want to go through it again."
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes"
yes.
"so, uh, would you drink at your house and then they would be fine with it?"
I'm sure.
yes.
sure.
yes.
yes.
"so, there's an event in your house."
"all right, let's go. Let's"
"all right, all right, all right,. it's going to be good. you've thought about not drinking in your life, right?"
"I've been sober for six months for the first time. well, I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I. last time, I drank a little more, you know, and I was a little drunk. well, after six months, I've stopped drinking as much as I used to drink, so I'm pretty sure I didn't have a problem."
"all right, so let's go. it's been six months since I've. it's been a long time."
yes.
what did you do for six months?
"well, it was a little weird. they didn't really talk to me. um--"
friends?
"yes. I'm, uh, I'm, uh, I'm"
"what? What? What? What? What. if I may ask, who were the friends. I'm not gonna be too personal, but, the friends who drink with you or just your-"
"no, my friends, I'm not talking about"
"-social circles, social circles. all right, all right, all"
I guess it's just my social circle.
what did they do to you?
I guess it's because I didn't drink. I'm not really sure. it seems like.
did you ask them about it?
"no, no, no, no, no. I'm not going to be able to because my girlfriend won't let me. you know, I'm thinking of you. she said if I were with them, she wouldn't be with me anymore. you know, I'd rather be a little calm and maybe things will be better with us."
you have a great girl-
sure.
-and that's important to you.
"you know, it's been like that since she left."
"yes, at the time, it was important."
yes.
why did she leave?
"when I drank, she left."
"after six months, I've been thinking about it."
"she said it wasn't going to work, and she decided not to continue with it."
"all right, all right, all right,. so you've been drinking, and then she left?"
"it's the same time. I'm not sure which came first. it's been the same time. we've had a lot of arguments. I'm not quite sure what I feel. I didn't have any friends. I'm missing them, you know, I've missed them."
did you feel like you were alone?
"yes. it was kind of weird 'cause I felt like she was trying to control me, and I, uh, I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I. so, we both decided, you know, it wasn't the right thing to do."
you're an independent man-
sure.
no one will tell you what to do.
"well, I guess I'll take it. sure. yes."
"yes. so, you've been drinking, and you've been drinking, and you've been drinking, and you've been drinking, and you've been drinking, and you've been drinking, and you've been drinking, and you've been drinking,"
"all right, let's see. it was a couple of weeks ago, and then, uh, it was a couple of weeks ago."
absolutely. yes.
yes. it's been a couple of years since I've been
"so, uh, what are the good things about drinking since then, and then-then maybe not so good things?"
"I'm not really sure if I can compare good or bad. well, I drink to socialize, you know, I don't know if it's going to change anything. well, you know, I drink to socialize."
mm-hmm. did they come back to your friends?
absolutely. yes. I'd go with them again when my girlfriend left. [laughter]
did your girlfriend not like you?
"well, she's not gonna let me go."
yes.
she thought they were really--
she's not just your friends anymore.
yes.
-wasn't that the relationship just not working?
"she blamed the first DUI on her. you know, because I was with them, they made me drink too much."
what do you think about this?
she was right about that. absolutely.
"so, you're-you're-you're-"
"I'd be fine if they didn't give me those shots at the end of the night. I could have driven, but I wouldn't have."
"if they didn't give you those shots, you'd be fine. yes."
yes.
where did it come from. that's what it was-
that's-- that's-- that's
-the first time you got a DUI.
"yes. I was on the lawn of the neighbour, and I took out the mailbox and I was on my way to the house."
it must have been scary.
I'm not really remembering much of the night.
wasn't it a blackout?
"I don't remember much, but I don't remember much."
"all right, so let's go. yes."
I'm not sure if it's a blackout. I'm not really interested in that-
"all right, all right, all right,"
remember how it happened.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm not saying I'm assuming it -
yes.
-I'm sorry about that. -I'm sorry about that.
"yes. yes. all right, it's all right."
"well, so, after that, the girl, I don't know, she was a girl. your girl's decided to--"
"after I've been in the mailroom, I'm."
mm-hmm.
"well, you know, we've been trying to work things out for about six months, but it's not working."
yes.
-it's not working.
"oh, my God."
"at this point, she became a little too possessive."
"yes. you've been looking for your friends and your friends, and she's the only one who's been in your life."
I'm tired of being controlled by her.
"no one likes to be controlled, okay. yes. well, uh, you've felt, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,. you've been drinking shots for them. you might have felt a little controlled. but. but. but. but. but. but. but"
"no, I'm not really. they didn't really control me. you know, they should have shot me last couple of shots, 'cause you know, you know, I'm pretty good. so-so-so-so"
yes.
"-you know, when they gave me the last shot, it was a little bit of a shock."
"at this point, they didn't care about your best interests."
"pretty much, pretty much."
then he sent you to the car.
"yes. I guess I took the other shots, but I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-. I'm not really remembering much."
it's a little bit of a hindsight.
yes.
yes.
yes. you're a little bit of a hindsight. that's what I'm thinking. [laughter]
"isn't it a little bit of a. yes, they will take the blame. so, you've been drinking, and then you started drinking again, and then. what. what. what. what. what. what. what. what. what. what. what. what. what. what. what. what. what."
yes. [crosstalk]
the same thing happened to me. [crosstalk]
"since high school, they've been my friends."
"so, you're important to them?"
absolutely.
"mm-hmm. yes. sometimes, people have friends who are friends, but then there's friends who will stay with us. so, the constant core will be your core."
"of course, of course."
"all right, all right, all right,"
yes.
"you've ever had, uh, uh, interest in other things, friends, like, what do you do when you don't have them?"
"well, you know, I'm gonna do things around the house, you know, uh, you know, I'm gonna cut the grass, you know, I'm gonna do it."
"yes. any other relationship, if I may ask you--"
"no, I'm single now, so, uh, you know, I'm not really."
how's it going?
"well, you know, I'm dating a little, but, uh, I don't want to be serious."
what-- so what do you think it looks like. um--
"well, I'm not interested in dating someone. I'm not really interested in a relationship."
"yes. all right, I'll take it. that's good. It's good. you seem to know yourself pretty well."
"of course, of course."
"all right, all right, all. all right, so let's go. if you don't mind me, Mike, what would you do differently, um, um, now that we're looking at, um, your second DUI?"
"well, I'd like to think about it a little bit."
we have to think what happens if you go out and do it again.
yes. I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I
yes. can you call someone?
"well, I'm not really thinking about it. I'd have to think about it, because if I wanted to go out and drink, I'd have to think about it. yes."
"all right, so let's go"
I guess I'll call it a cab or something.
they'll come. They'll come.
yes. I'm sure it will be something.
"yes. they'll come. They'll come. if you have money, they'll come. yes."
"yes. I'd like to take a little money, so I'll put it in my pocket."
yes.
"-and I'll put it in there for emergencies, and I'll have money. if I'm drunk, I'll just call the cab."
"so, when you're using your money, you're somewhere else?"
what is it?
"you'd have a different bar money, not in your wallet?"
I guess I'll have my pocket in the front.
"all right, let's go. Let's. all right, all right, all right,. so, that's what it is, y-yeah."
yes.
"that's true, that's a good idea. then you'd have a different place to hide your money."
"yes. you know, if I'm gonna, uh- if I'm gonna, uh- if I'm gonna, uh- if I'm gonna, uh- if I'm gonna."
mm-hmm.
I'd have a plan to-
it seems like a good plan.
-to go home. yes.
"yes. so, uh, how often do you think you'll need the plan?"
"I'd say it's my wallet for a while, 'cause I'm not really sure about it. I'm just-I'm just-"
"all right, so let's go"
"-you know, it's just an isolated incident."
mm-hmm.
"well, I'm just, uh--"
"you said if you had people, you'd drink for the Super Bowl. isn't it a big game?"
yes.
"excuse me, but I'm a fan of football, right?"
"you know, you have to have a couple of people at the Super Bowl."
"so, you'd be in and, uh, I'm curious about the people who leave your house, would you be concerned about them. sometimes I'm designated by the driver."
"but I'm not really interested in people who drink a lot. they don't drink, so I mean, they can handle it, you know, they can handle it."
"so, they'll have to do it?"
"sure, I'd say yes."
mm-hmm.
yes.
"you thought about it, and you wanted to do something, the wallet, the money in the wallet and-and for the cab."
yes.
"you have to socialize, and you have to socialize, and you have to socialize, and you have to socialize, and you have to socialize, and you have to socialize, and you. what did you not drink for six months. if you'd rather not drink."
"it's a- it's a good thing. I'm not really interested in my friends, and I'm not really interested in what it's like. well, I feel good physically and, uh, you know, I've done really well, but, you know, it's just. I'm just a little-- I'm a little isolated. you know, I'm not comfortable with it."
"it's been six months. do you remember, um. try to think of someone else. wasn't it just you?"
"we tried to work it out with my girlfriend. you know, it's like we're arguing all the time. you know what I mean. it was good, but it didn't seem like anything else had changed."
"all right, let's go. Let"
"you know, I'm thinking of you"
"if you didn't-- if you were to go with the plan of not drinking, which you mentioned-"
yes.
"um, uh, your girlfriend Mary doesn't belong to you."
no-no-no-no
"-now, I'm thinking of it."
-and I'm not really sure it's going to work.
do you think there's something else that would fill that. the friends' room?
"well, I'm not sure. well, my friends drink, too. you know, it's hard to be with them, and then-- when I don't drink, 'cause I don't feel like it."
"of course, I see what you're saying. I heard you said they drank a lot, but they didn't drink much."
"yeah, they don't drink much, but they look like they drink."
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry. sure."
it's just beer. you know-you know-you know
"all right, so let's go"
-they don't drink whiskey or anything like that. it's--
yes. so. so. so. so
"well, I don't know, but they drink beer, and it's. I'm thinking of a couple of drinks and maybe I'll have a little more than a couple, you know-"
mm-hmm.
"-and then I'm not sure what's really important. so, I'm thinking of what. it's like two or three drinks a day."
"every hour of the day, one drink."
"every hour, one drink."
mm-hmm.
I have to remember that. [laughing]
"or one shot, or one shot"
"all right, one shot."
-a glass of wine or a beer.
"all right, all right, all"
um-um-um-um
but one more?
mm-hmm.
that's what it is.
"yes. isn't that something that would be, uh, a reality?"
"yeah, I'd say so. I guess I know a couple of friends who don't drink."
then who's who's who?
I have to think about it. I'm not really good friends. I'm friends with some of them who don't drink.
it's-- It's-- It's
-I know everyone likes to drink.
what would it do to your relationship with these people if you didn't drink?
"yeah, I'm. I'm. I'm."
it's going to work and.
"I'm not sure. it's weird, I-I think it's a little weird, you know, and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-"
"it's uncomfortable, but it's okay."
"yes. yes, exactly."
what's so uncomfortable about it?
"well, if I drink soda, they're a little bit of a problem."
what would you do to you?
"you know, they're just messing with me until I drink. so. so. so. so"
"well, and-and-and. I see, yes."
"well, I mean, just-"
"yeah, like a little bit of a-"
-I guess it's just a little bit of a kiss.
"yes, yes, yes."
"you know, I'm not really interested in being an outsider, you know what I mean. I'm-- I'm-- I"
"all right, so you're gonna make--"
"you know, I've been with them since high school. so I'm not gonna be able to."
"mm-hmm, and-"
it means a lot to me.
"-it's [unintelligible 00:24:05]. I-I-I know you're very important to friends and, uh, I'm wondering how important it is to you to stay friends."
"I guess it's not a bad idea to not be with them for a minute. yeah, I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I"
look what happens to you.
sure. I'd probably try something like that.
"yeah-yeah, how important is it. it's not important, but it's pretty important."
"you know, if I have to go back to my license, it would be very important to stop hanging around with them."
"mm-hmm. all right, all right, all. [unintelligible 00:24:52] something you'd like to try. all right, all right, all"
absolutely.
it's good to hear that.
yes.
"if you want, we might talk about it next time."
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes"
yes.
"I'd say that would be a good idea. uh, that's gonna help me, like, the plans I've made, like, uh, that's gonna help me."
"I'm sure, uh, I'd say, uh, I'd say, uh, I'd say, uh, I'd say"
"all right, all right, all right,"
"-about the plans you're trying to achieve. um, I'd like to read this assessment-Mm."
"-and then you'll be mostly on your own. you have the choice. well, I think there's no reason why you couldn't do it. you've thought a lot about it, and you've got a plan, and you've got a lot of ideas, and you're thinking of everything else you might want to do to help you stay out of the driver's seat."
"well, I guess I don't drink much. I'd be much less worried if I didn't drink."
you'd be fine if you didn't worry.
yes.
"well, it's not fun to worry."
yes. that's true. It's true. yes.
"all right, let's go. Let. all right, thanks to Mike. I'm glad you appreciate it."
"all right, all right, all. thank you. Thank you. Thank you"
thank you. Thank you. Thank you
"hello, Mary, how you doing?"
"all right, all right, all. where do you want to sign it?"
"all right, you're gonna sign it here. you don't seem to be in the mood for a conversation."
not really.
"all right, all right, all. looks like you've been in school for a day. today, you've missed the first hour of the class."
"all right, whatever. I'm just, yeah."
doesn't that concern you at this point?
"it's just like every day, I don't really know why. why do you ask me about this?"
"you're wondering what the visit is about, me coming to your house."
yes.
"all right, all right, all. would you like to explain what this program is about?"
I'm sure.
"I'll stop by every day to make sure you're here and you're following and responding to your GPS and that, uh, if you leave the house, you'll be charged. well, you know, when I'm visiting you, it's just to see you as well as I'm visiting you, so, uh, you know, it's kind of my job to monitor your day-to-day."
so you're just curious about my business?
I guess it's a little suspicious sometimes.
mm-hmm.
I know some clients have been confused about my feelings for you. you've expressed a goal of getting out of the program as quickly as possible when we met.
mm-hmm.
that's how I know it's just a little bit of being here when you need to be there.
mm-hmm.
but it still seems like we have to do something like this.
"yes. I guess I'll be here if I have to, but I can't promise anything."
are you still worried about not knowing if you can do it?
because it's kind of like why do you want to know my business. why do you care about this?
"I know you have a lot of other people in your life, and I'm sure your mom is worried about you."
mm-hmm.
I'm sure it's going to be a big deal.
it's like a lot of things.
mm-hmm.
you feel like there's a lot of rules.
yes. and I'm sure it's struggling too.
mm-hmm.
"well, some clients have expressed a great deal of respect for freedom. until it was gone, they didn't realize how much they valued it."
I'd like to have that one thing.
freedom of speech?
mm-hmm.
what would you do to get your freedom back?
I'm guessing you're signing the papers.
"yes, just sign the papers when I'm here. even though it seems a little annoying sometimes, we're doing it."
mm-hmm.
what other ways do you want to return to freedom?
I don't want to be here and be stuck in my house and everyone who comes to visit me and know my business.
"so you don't want to do what you've done, you don't want to commit the crime, and, uh, 'cause you don't like it?"
yes.
"all right, that's okay. well, I'm sure you're trying. I'm glad you're still signing the paperwork when I'm here, even if you don't like it. thank you, at least you did it."
mm-hmm.
"all right, all right, all. do you want to tell me something before I leave?"
not really.
"all right, so I'm going to go back today so I can see you."
"all right, let's go. Let"
"all right, let's go. Let"
good-bye. Good-bye.
"for me, it's a matter of"
"so, um, we want to pick at least three goals that they want to work on in the next 30 days. we'll check you out and see how you're doing with your goals in 30 days. so we're asking you to pick something that's relevant to you, something that you're willing to work on. so, um, you'd like to change your job at home or school, um, [unintelligible 00: 00: 00: 00]?"
"first hour, I'm supposed to start school. I've always missed the class."
you want to work on the first hour of the first hour?
"yes, I'm sure."
"all right, all right, all. it's a great goal. why do you want to achieve this goal?"
"well, people will be on my back."
and who's the people who are here?
"mom always says, you're going to school. if you don't get the school on time, I'll take you to the PO."
you definitely want to avoid that?
"yes, I'm sure."
"all right, all right, all. you'll work on your first hour at school."
I'll try to do it.
what specific steps would you need to take to get to school?
"I'm not going to the morning. it's hard, and then I'm going to the bus, and then I'm going to the dress. I'm usually walking or I'm going to try to find a ride. maybe it's just a bunch of reasons why I'm late."
"all right, so it's not just one big thing?"
"no, no, no, no"
"what would you do to get to school on time if you knew that there could be a couple of things that could be a problem. what do you know, you're supposed to do it?"
it's probably a good time to get up.
when do you want to go?
"I'm going to the bus, and I'm going to go to bed, and I'm not sure if I can do it, 'cause I'm tired."
"you don't know if you can do it, but you want to do it because you don't want to go back."
"all right, so let's go. I'd like to try it-"
"all right, all right, all"
- and see what happens.
"all right, so you're willing to try it?"
"yes, I'm sure."
so you're supposed to go to bed by 6: 15 at night?
I'm going to try to go to midnight. I'll try to go to 11: 00.
"all right, all right, all. all right, so you want to go to bed at 11: 00 and then you'll be at 6: 15?"
"yes, I'm sure."
when do you start with this big day?
tomorrow or the next day.
"all right, so if I'd written it down, what would you like me to write. tomorrow or the next day?"
we'll start tomorrow.
"tomorrow night. all right, so, great. who would be able to help you get to bed and make sure you're on time?"
"mom, I'm sorry. I'm"
your mom's got a little bit of
mm-hmm.
"all right, all right, all. anything your mom would have done to help you?"
"if I don't wake up, she'll come in and wake me up and remind me that I said I'd go to sleep."
"it's almost like you want your mom to tell you. it's not because your mom is making you go to school like you want to remember, ""Remember, this is something you want to do for yourself."""
it's exactly. It's exactly. yes.
"all right, so let's get. what if you don't get up by 6: 15?"
[sighs] I'm not going to sleep.
I don't want to go to bed.
"sure, I'm going to have a tough time."
"all right, all right, all. if you're tempted to stay,"
mm-hmm.
- How do you respond to that?
"don't go to bed, don't turn off the lights."
"all right, so you have a phone. so you keep your phone out of the way."
"yes, I'm sure."
- and even if the lights were off and the lights were off?
"yes, I'm sure."
it reminds me to go to bed.
mom's gonna check on me to make sure everything's okay.
and-and your mom's also supporting you.
mm-hmm.
"all right, so let's get. how do you know your plan is working?"
"when I'm in school, when the bell rings and I'm in school."
"when the bell rings, you know, it's the goal."
absolutely.
"what I've heard so far - what a great goal. you have some insight into how you do it. you really need to go to the first hour because you don't want to go back to the penalty. you've already planned to go to bed by 11: 00, turn off the lights, put your phone away. you'll be able to help your mom, even if you don't have a mom. it seems like it's going to be a little early, but you're willing to do it. if you don't, your mom will help you."
"yeah, I'm hoping so."
you said you were going to start tomorrow.
I'll try it.
"all right, so let's get. thank you very much."
you're welcome. You're welcome.
what's going on with you?
I'm just calling for my call.
"all right, let's go. Let. yes, I've been told you've been taken away from the phone."
[scoffs] Yeah.
what's going on?
"I'm not sure. he's like he's gonna do something to me or something. I don't know what it is. I don't want to make my bed, I'm not taking it. I'm just looking for my phone."
"all right, all right, all. you know, it's weird when I'm like, uh, you've been a model, you've been a model, you've been a model, you've been a model, you've been a model, you've been a model, you've. so, uh, you're going to be in three weeks. it's going to be hard."
I'm just gonna talk to my mom.
"mm-hmm. you've been talking to your mom for a week, and you haven't even talked to her for a week. it seems pretty difficult. did you say something about your father's birthday?"
I have a father's birthday tomorrow.
"all right, all right, all"
I'm just gonna talk to my mom. that's what it is.
"it's been a long time, so I know you're really nervous about this, so I'm really worried about you, so I'm really worried about you, so I'm really worried about you, so I'm really worried about you, so I. so you think something might be going on with you?"
hello. Hi. Hi. Hi. you're [unintelligible 00: 00: 00: 00: 00: 00:
yes.
"all right, all right, all. what's the point of your visit?"
I should learn how to manage diabetes. I just got a diagnosis.
mm-hmm. I see you have a very high blood glucose or A1C.
"yes, that's what the doctor said. she really took me to her. I guess it's really serious. she said she lost her eyesight, my feet, my head, and everything else. I guess I'll learn how to handle it, but it sounds like a big thing."
"mm-hmm. you're supposed to take the medicine. you know, we have to start dieting, uh, you know, lose weight, change your diet, exercise, uh, to control diabetes."
"it's a big deal, and I don't know if I can do it, and on top of it, it's. if I don't do it."
"sure, it's possible."
[sighing]
"well, we-we need to start looking at all those different things to control your diabetes."
"well, I'm sorry, but I'm sorry, but I'm sorry."
"hello, Mr. Green, I'm sorry. it's really nice to see you. you've got a little bit of a blood pressure and cholesterol, too, if you remember last week. we'll discuss some things you can do to improve the situation today. your health can affect all sorts of things. so we'll talk about the general thing, but how do you do it?"
I guess you'll tell me it's all my fault and I have to change my ways and I'm gonna give up the things I like.
"in fact, I won't do it because you're the boss. what you do with your health is up to you."
the doctor said I have to take pills for the rest of my life.
it doesn't seem too happy for you.
"I'm fine, but the doctor said I could save my life."
"you can do a lot of things yourself that will improve the situation. we can do it all today, smoking, diet, exercise, weight, loss, all those things. we'll start with you and see what you think."
"all right, what do you want to do first?"
"you have to take care of yourself, you're the boss of your life. where do you want to start?"
where do you think I'm going to start?
"well, I'd like to give you my opinion. I'll tell you a lot of information, but I think you'll know the score. you'd know what I'd say."
"you're telling me to stop smoking and lose weight and exercise, right?"
"absolutely. I'm right. I'm right. it would have a huge impact on stopping smoking, which would have a big impact very soon. loss of weight also has a big impact because it will help with blood pressure, cholesterol, and diabetes risk. what do you think about what I'm talking about. uh, uh, uh, uh"
"I've lost weight, but it's hard to lose something you like."
"it's really hard to do this. it's hard to know where to start, right?"
"I'd really like to. or I shouldn't have done it,"
then why do you want to lose weight?
I'd like to see my kids settle down and my grandchildren grow up.
so you're important to your family?
"yes, I'm sure. I'd like to help them, but I don't have to."
yes. so where do you think you're going to start?
"I've been thinking a lot lately, and I'd like to be there. I have to do what I need to improve my health."
what would you think to do first?
"first of all, I'd cut my drink. it's going to increase my weight and blood pressure, right?"
"yes. it's a good place to start, mmm-hmm."
"in fact, I'm thinking of trying to cut out the booze. I drink too much at the weekend."
then I think it's really supportive.
I guess I'd be able to cut the pie and the chips.
what would you do to make sure you don't get hungry?
I'll start with soup at lunch. two pies would be much better than a big bowl of soup.
yes. a big bowl of soup. maybe you'll be able to count five or maybe even two. so it would be a good place to start. do you think about anything else?
"I've done it, I've stopped adding salt to my food. the doctor said it would help my blood pressure."
"all right, that's good. it's probably going to help you. the salt intake is linked to calcium loss in the bones, which makes them more brittle. it will also help reduce the salt intake."
"well, I'm not sure. well, I'm glad you know. she likes her salt and her mother has osteoporosis."
"well, you might as well help her. Mr. Green, you have a great start. you know what you have to do, and you know what you have to do. you've already reduced your alcohol intake, so you've already reduced your salt intake. when you're ready, we can talk about smoking and exercise, when you're ready. then how do you feel about it?"
"I feel like I'm starting, but I'm going to start with the pies, the crisps, the booze, and the cut. well, the next day, the numbers will be much better."
"that's great. It's great. then next week, we'll meet at the same time?"
"yes, I'm fine with it."
"that's great. It's great. all right, then, I'll be happy."
thank you. you're also in the same place.
"hello, welcome. well, uh - and, uh - and"
thank you. Thank you. Thank you
I'm Mark and I'm working for Green Prescription. and-and-and-and
mm-hmm.
"from the doctor's referral letter, I know a little bit."
from the doctor's office?
"from your doctor, I'm sure."
"well, uh, uh, uh"
I'd like to ask you a little bit about what led you to come here today and what you've been thinking about.
what's the reason I came here?
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
my doctor's got me.
what did he tell you?
"well, uh, I've been a little. uh, I've been a little. uh, I've been"
mm.
"he also revealed that I might have diabetes. well, that's what he's saying."
"all right, so let's go"
I-I'm fine. I feel good. I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
"well, that's why I'm here. I'm on his orders, almost."
"well, so he gave you a directive?"
"well, he's done it. if it gets worse, he'll put me on a program."
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
but I'm saying I feel great.
"you were a little surprised, you're okay."
yes.
"you're going to the doctor's for a checkup. ""you have Type II diabetes,"" he says."
I'm very surprised. I'm very surprised.
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry. did you come out of the blue?"
"yes, I'm sure. I'm sure it's true."
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
you're saying you don't look like Type II diabetes. you've probably had a little idea-
I-I-I-I
-you were overweight.
that's what I'm supposed to understand.
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
"well, I don't have a lot of weight."
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
"in that way, I'm a little bit of a self-help. well, I guess I'm busy, so I'm burning calories. and-and-and-and"
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
I'm not really sure.
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
the lifestyle I live -
"well, I'm thinking of something. so it's not going to fit in your head Type II diabetes."
"no, no, no, no"
"-your lifestyle, your life?"
"no, not at all."
it's a big surprise. what did you think when he told you?
"well, I-I'm sure he's joking. to be honest, I'm not sure. I've been thinking-I've been"
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
"-you know, why you're here."
"mm, mm."
"well, I mean, I don't think he's wasting my time, but why would he do it?"
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes"
"all right, so, so,"
he's got a lot of work to do.
absolutely.
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
"he has a job to do. of course, the tests have been carried out. I'm diabetic 2."
"all right, so let's go"
"all right, so, so,. well, I'm not really interested in it, Mark."
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
um - - - - - -
then how do you feel about your head?
I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm
-and what the tests say is that you don't join.
yes. I'm absolutely fine physically.
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
I didn't do anything wrong.
"well, I'm thinking of something"
"I'm fine, I'm sleeping pretty well."
hmm-hmm.
I'm kind of like you know-
"well, I'm thinking of something"
- I-I-I-I-I-I-I-. so I'm not gonna.
"yes. what's the problem with you. I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
what's the problem with you?
you probably thought about how it happened. how did you--?
"all right, uh, yes. I mean, I'm thinking of it"
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
-I'm sure I didn't do much research. I was a little busy.
"all right, all right, all"
"well, he said something about family or something. I'm not sure."
yes.
I'm not sure if it's hereditary.
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
he said he thought it was hereditary.
he said it might be a family thing. and so you're-
yes.
maybe it's from your parents.
"yeah, it's possible -"
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
"because, um, my mom said-"
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
"-that's right, my father's got diabetes."
"all right, so let's go"
"-diabetes 2. if I'm thinking, um, his brother."
mm-hmm.
-I've been looking for him for years.
yes.
he's probably got him because he's-
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
"-a nice guy, a nice guy. you know-you know-you know"
"all right, so let's go"
he's a big guy.
so he's going to fit the picture.
"yes, the stereotype -"
-when you think about what he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he
"yeah, I'd say so."
"a little bigger, maybe he doesn't look so good, and he's going to fit it."
"yeah, I'm sure. as far as I know, I haven't seen him."
yes.
-I'm not sure how long it's been.
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry. do you have a family history of diabetes?"
"I guess so. yes, I guess so."
the doctor said it was a factor.
"it's hereditary, right?"
"of course, it's true. yes, I'm sure. there is a hereditary factor or genetic factor involved in the inheritance of parents or parents."
"a genetic factor. so, if you have a history of this, it means that if you have a family history."
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
-if it's a gene. you're more likely to have it?
"all right, all right, all. yes."
and it's also - - - - - -
but it's not inevitable.
"all right, so let's go. all right, all right, all"
the only factor that causes it or causes it to happen to you is the genes or the hereditary factor. so there's a lot of other factors.
I'm sure you'll tell me what they're like.
"you mentioned some of the things you know, and one of them is hereditary. you've mentioned the doctor's saying it. what else do you know or have you heard. you're saying you didn't have much time to research. what else. you've got other things to do."
"to be honest, Mark, I'm not really sure. I don't really know what's going on with it, but I don't have any reason. I was taken by the doctor and I came back."
yes.
"well, maybe it's the inheritance thing."
that's true. It makes sense.
why don't we go on?
yes.
it's not going to help me.
yes.
"they've lived long lives, they've lived long lives."
they've done it. They've done it.
the relatives were relatively old.
"all right, all right, all. if you want to know more about the factors involved in Type II diabetes, I don't know if it would be helpful."
"all right, so."
if that's what it would help.
if you think something-- Yes. of course.
maybe I'll share what I've learned from working with others and some of the things I've experienced in working with people.
"all right, all right, all"
"look what you've done to it. looks like it's a little more of a fit for where you're at. so we know there's a strong family factor or a hereditary factor. this type of diabetes is also more likely to happen in later life, rather than something you might have gotten in your teens. so-so it's a little late. it's going to take a minute to develop. well, I think the main thing is that it's insulin."
I heard about it.
it's a hormone or a chemical that allows you to use sugar.
"all right, so let's go"
"all right, let's go. Let. in the cells of the cells, the cells of the cells, the fat cells or the muscle cells or the liver cells are resistant to insulin. they're not allowed to use insulin. so the system is built up with sugar."
you're saying they don't like insulin or they don't?
"in cells, muscle or fat or wherever, you need insulin to use up excess sugar or to use sugar."
I'm sure. it's like a balance.
that's right.
so you're taking insulin.
kind of like your.
you're going to the bar yourself.
Yap. Yap. Yap
"then the insulin is taking off the excess, and then the body will balance it."
yes.
or-or is it a digestive. should I say the sugar is too much?
that's a good way to think.
was it really like that?
it's exactly. It's exactly. insulin resistance is resistant to insulin in Type II diabetes. it almost seems like they're saying we can't use it.
why are you telling me this?
"well, there's a lot of research to be done and how it happens and how it can be changed. but the key thing to manage it is to try to change or modify the amount of sugar in your system."
"all right, so let's go. all right, all right, all"
"yes. if they want to control the amount of sugar in their system, which is the main cause of diabetes, they have to take care of it, which is something we know people with Type II diabetes have to think about. too much sugar, and if it's not used in the blood cells, in the fat cells, or liver cells, or muscle cells. it can cause problems with your circulation. and so can high blood sugar and low blood sugar. you mentioned a couple of things that the doctor was a little worried about Type II diabetes. what have you noticed over the last month?"
you're saying it personally?
yes.
"well, I'm not sure. you know, I thought about it a little bit and I thought, well, if things go slowly, you don't really notice."
yes.
"as you get older, you're more likely to"
yes.
"you know, I'm not like I used to, you know, um, you know, I'm more likely to spend more time with my old."
yes.
"yes, at the club and the like. I'm not after the king anymore, I'm going to the snapper."
a little more relaxed lifestyle.
absolutely. you're just doing it.
yes.
"you're just doing it. you know, I guess you're less demanding, and you don't really want to do it. you're letting the kids go home."
yes.
"I've been there, I've done it. you're not really noticing it. I should have felt like that, right?"
yes. it's like you have something really bad about you.
"yeah, I'm thinking of it."
"what have you been feeling for the last month. you're saying you're busy, so you're working."
"yeah, I'm busy. all right, so what do you say. I'm working in insurance, so I'm always looking for a new place."
yes.
I'm not noticing anything.
Mh-hmm.
"I don't really notice how, um, okay, I'm a little tired."
"all right, all right, all"
"if I'm too much of a hurry. I guess, uh, I'm not going to two at the same time, I'll use one at a time."
isn't there a little bit of energy. the vitality.
"I don't have the energy I've got. I have to, you know, I have to, you know, I have to sit down, you know, I have to sit down and relax."
"yes, mh-hmm."
"well, I wouldn't normally be able to do it."
yes.
but that's what it would be.
Mh-hmm.
"well, is it going to be worse. I'm not sure. I-I-I-I-I-I-. what's worse than that. is it going to increase. well, I'm not really noticing it."
"you're not noticing it, but you're not noticing. you know, it's a gradual thing, you know, as you get older, things are going to slow down. it's like what happens to you."
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. well, at least I think so. I don't know if you're telling me I should be more active or my doctor says I should be more active."
Mh-hmm.
"I'm saying, uh, I don't do any regular exercise, I'm saying, not anymore."
yes.
"well, uh, uh, uh"
"all right, all right, all"
but maybe I'm not sure.
it's a little mysterious.
"I mean, I have a great life. if it's good, it's good. I'm at the rugby club with my friends. you know, even in the summer. I've been playing football and I've been playing cricket. well, for the summer, I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-. well, of course, we have fishing, and that's all of us. we're a big group, really."
really. I hear you have a lot of good things in your life.
"yeah, I'm sure I have a life. I have a great life."
do you think things are going well?
"you're sick, you're sick, you're sick."
yes. it's not going to fit.
"no, I'm not. he said he would monitor me daily, but he said he would be monitoring me."
Mh-hmm.
I'll take regular pills.
"all right, so let's go"
"in fact, I only take a little bit of paracetamol."
yes. when you have a headache.
"you know, for a little bit of a head."
yes.
"well, uh, uh, uh"
it's kind of like you're testing your blood sugar and taking medication.
"come on, you know, you're gonna have to"
"well, it's a little too much."
life is too short for us.
too much.
it's true. It's true.
"yes. all right, all right, all"
"you know, I'm thinking of you -"
"you know, I think you're here today and you know I'd like to see what they have to say. I wonder what we can talk about for the time we have today. you've been told by the doctor you might need to take medication, so you mentioned a couple of things. we can talk about a lot of things. what would you like to focus on?"
"well, I've been thinking about something, and, uh, I've been thinking about it a little bit, and, uh, I've been thinking about it a little bit. well, we've been married for a long time."
"well, I'm thinking of something"
she used to take care of me because she used to cook and-and-and stuff like that.
"all right, all right, all"
I'm not the best cook in the world.
Mh-hmm.
"you know, and you know, it's time to go to the rugby club or whatever, you know, we're on our way home. I-I guess she wasn't as healthy as she used to be. if you meet her mother, she'll move to Hamilton. well, but, uh, but, uh, but"
"since you've been alone since you split up, you've noticed that things you eat and how you eat have changed."
"yeah, sometimes they're pretty good friends and their wives."
"well, I'm thinking of something"
because they invite me to lunch and so on.
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes"
"yes, yes, yes, yes. well, or whatever reason, you've split up in life."
"well, I'm thinking of something"
"you're thinking, ""Hmm, I'm thinking of someone else's life."""
"well, I'm thinking of something. yes, yes, yes, yes, yes"
"""it's a nice meal, right?"". and you know, I'm thinking of you"
yes. did your wife do a lot of it for you?
"she'd cook everything. yes, yes, yes, yes, yes"
yes.
"you know, I've never even cooked an egg in the water."
"she would take care of what you ate and what you ate, and she would be looking at you and off you."
"absolutely. you know, I've been in charge of wine."
mm-hmm. you have to think about what you're gonna eat and sometimes you don't eat the best.
"all right, I'm saying this is what I'm saying. maybe I don't think about it. maybe that's what it is."
"all right, all right, all"
maybe I'm just.
"well, I'm thinking of something"
because the pizza shop is on the way.
yes.
"well, I confess, sometimes, I'm hungry and McDonald's is very convenient."
yes.
-or any of the Kentucky Fried.
"it's very nice, isn't it?"
"it's very easy. well, then you think about it, maybe I should have a little bit of vegetables or something. you're going to the store, you know, and you'll pick up your dinner."
"mmm, mm-mm, mm-mm."
you're going to put them in the microwave and you'll put them in the oven and there's vegetables.
"they're pretty good on the plate, aren't they?"
"you know, it's- it's- it's- it's- it's- it's- it. if I have a night, it will happen. no, I didn't cook anything, but I've just cooked the kettle for coffee."
yes.
-for ages.
it's not what you've actually been thinking about or thinking about in the past.
yes. I'm missing breakfast for her. I'm sure we had a good breakfast.
"you know, you've noticed that diet and eating habits and-"
all right - - - - -
-when you're eating. that's the only thing. what other things do you think you'd be?
"I've been smoking a lot, haven't I. in half a day, I'd smoke a pack. I knew it wasn't going to help me."
"all right, so let's go"
"when you're a-- I mean, I've always smoked. you know, but when you're young and you're a sportsman."
you're kind of juggling both things.
"you know, they balance each other out, and everyone else is"
"you're still running, and you're smoking?"
"you're almost smoking the backline, aren't you. before the game starts -"
"well, I'm thinking of something. well, I'm thinking of something. yes, part of the culture."
"yes, part of the whole thing. in my time, it was a much more social game, and it was spent in the rugby club."
yes.
that's why you're playing and it's a great friendship.
yes.
it's just like football and cricket.
"well, I'm thinking of something"
"well, but now, but."
"you've actually reduced your smoking, or you've stopped smoking?"
"yes, I-I-I-I-I-. I was a little-- I was a little, you know, a little dizzy and I thought, ""I'm going to cut it."""
"well, I'm thinking of something"
but I'm enjoying smoking. I'm really enjoying it. I guess it's been about 10 a day.
"all right, so you're supposed to cut."
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes"
you've noticed that your breathing and health are affected by it.
yes.
you've reduced your smoking when you've been talking about smoking.
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. I'm kind of. I'm a little"
so you've decided to do it?
"""why don't you give up?"" She'll say. you've gone a long way, why don't you stop? "". but I'm not interested in it."
"well, I'm thinking of something"
"it's. it's. I like it, uh."
"it's hard to stop something you like, right?"
"yeah, I'm sure. you know, you know, the thing is, you know, you have to, uh, you have to. when you're down, you have to."
"well, I'm thinking of something"
"in a way, I guess, you have to be strong-willed."
yes.
"""all right, if you don't have a cigarette, you don't have a cigarette. [laughing]"
"well, I'm thinking of something"
"you know, it's a double-edged sword, because then I drank more coffee."
but they're so good together. and the sugar in the coffee?
"yes, yes, yes. I'm supposed to have two sugars. a little bit of sugar in the coffee. yes, yes, yes, yes, yes"
"well, I'm thinking of something"
so we're gonna cut it down.
"well, I'm thinking of something"
"but we have to go to eight or nine, ten cups of coffee."
"you drink more coffee. I heard you say, if I start from the beginning, you'd say, ""I've been to the doctor."". you're going to-- you're going to check out the check."
"""I'm going to go for the annual,"" he said to a friend of mine."
MIT.
"-a little bit of a fitness thing, you know. now I'm thinking, not one of those."
"I have to check it out, right?"
"you know, at 55, it's more common to have a heart disease."
"well, I'm thinking of something"
"-and all those things that you're doing in your mid-life. ""all right, I'll go and see what it is."". in fact, I've been very confident since I've been there. ""I'd like to be healthy as you,"" the doctor said."
yes.
"unfortunately, uh, he's got it. he came up with the only thing. I'm thinking - I think I'm"
so everything else looks good?
I have a good cholesterol.
you have a good cholesterol.
yes-yes. it wasn't too bad.
"you smoke, but you've reduced it."
"yeah, I cut it down, yeah. it's been three years, right?"
"you're going down the list, you know, everything else. the tires are good, the oil is good."
absolutely.
so we're looking good.
then we're going to the point-
"wait, I have to tell you something."
-too much sugar in the tank. I'm not sure.
"yes, this bit is a little bad."
"so, yeah, so, yeah."
and that's not how you see your life.
"no, no, no, no"
you seem to have made conscious effort to recognize some of the things you might think are important.
"yeah, I'm sure. you know, the thing is, you know, and I mean, and I mean, and people, they're turning around, you know, they're."
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
you're not supposed to smoke.
yes.
"""well, maybe I shouldn't be social."". ""well, maybe I shouldn't be here."""
"as a domino effect, and everyone will sit down."
"you know, I'm thinking of you. what-what-what's going on. it's a life of many people."
m-hm.
"if it's a problem, then, and someone says, ""Well, you can solve it by taking a pill every day, you know, it'll be fine, and."". the doctor said I should change my lifestyle, but I didn't want to change my life."
"kind of broad, like you have to change everything."
"yes. well, I-I said, no. excuse me. I'm sorry. I. [cough] I won't change my habits. I have to go where I'm going. I'm pretty happy with that. all right, I'd like to be separated. all right, I'd like to have my kids. he's playing in France in rugby in France."
"yes. you thought, yes, I hear you, but I don't want to change my life."
"no, I'm not, 'cause I don't think I need it."
you'd like to. yes.
why?
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
"I'm not gonna argue with a doctor, Mark, because I don't know anything."
"the test is the test, the experience is the test."
what-what-what-what suggestions would you have. what kind of-what kind of-what kind of-what kind
"I'm not sure. I'm thinking about where we start, and that's what I'm thinking. you mentioned a couple of things you've done, or you've been conscious of them. you mentioned the diet, you mentioned smoking, and we often talk about how people work."
so smoking is linked to diabetes?
"it's going to have an impact, yes. smoking is affecting the blood system, so it's hardening arteries, and it can cause a significant impact on healing. it takes a long time to heal Type II diabetes, especially if they have a cut or bruise. smoking reduces the oxygen in your body, so it's going to be harder to heal."
"oh, my God."
so we know that smoking and diabetes are linked.
don't help me.
-it's not a good combination.
"isn't it okay if you're not together. excuse me, but I'm just asking a silly question. [laughing]"
"I guess, for you, where would you like to start. you're not ready for a whole lifestyle change, and I'm not sure you're ready for a change in your life, which sounds like you don't want to change anything, which sounds like you don't want to change anything, which sounds like you. if you were to change anything, where would you be the most comfortable?"
"where do I start. what if I'm cutting the sugar in the coffee. if we're going to be long, we don't have milk, no sugar."
yes. maybe it's a start.
I'd probably be able to handle it.
"well, I'm thinking of something like. it's also true that people make small changes, small changes, and that's what it starts to be, it's a little bit of a good thing."
it's a bit of a rollover effect.
"-rollover, the domino effect starts to happen, and they start looking at other things."
"it's a domino effect, yes."
"instead, I'm thinking, ""Oh, my God, I'm gonna have to change everything."". I have to stop smoking, I have to exercise, I have to eat more, I have to start eating more fruit and vegetables."
how much exercise do I have a week?
"I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-. as to how much you need to do, I think it depends on how things go."
"all right, so let's go"
you've mentioned before that doctors are talking about your blood sugar.
yes.
"so how it goes. you can have longer blacks, not short blacks, with a lot of sugar, if you start doing it. you'll find your blood sugar is dropping, so we're going to go right."
"all right, so - - - - -"
"you know, I guess it's up to how you're doing, and you'll get feedback. if you go in the right direction, you'll continue to do it and do it more."
"I don't know, I'm just saying that, really, I only have to forget everything, but I'm not gonna sugar, uh, in the coffee and the milk. well, if we're doing this, then what?"
you'll be comfortable with where we start.
it's not difficult to do.
I'll have an apple for breakfast.
"you'll have an apple, a bit of apple and so on. um - - - - - -"
"you said something like, you think there's a useful starting point."
maybe.
"it wasn't a big change, but a little thing."
yes.
"you might be able to make some changes here, and it's a little dawning. I'm asking you, please tell me. well, let's say you start to make some of these small changes and you start to make some of them."
yes.
"in the next three, four, five years, where do you see it. in three to four years, what will you be. what would you like to see?"
"well, I'm not healthy now, so it's hard."
"no, no, no, no"
"I guess it would be fun to join a club or two, that's what I'm thinking."
yeah. do you like the social aspect?
"the social aspect is great, and I know there's a bar in the club. I'm not gonna drink, I'm not gonna drink."
"no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm sure."
"-until. I don't drink, I'm not like that, I."
"it's actually a social aspect of the whole thing, right?"
"yeah, I guess I'm up in the morning sometimes, and I guess I'm a little-- I mean yes, I'm a little-- I mean yes, I'm a little-- I mean yes, I'm a little-- I mean yes,"
yes.
"you know, I'm thinking of you. even after a good night's sleep?"
I don't have that-
I'll have a cup of coffee and maybe I'll--
and the coffee will help you a little?
that's what I'm going to do. yes.
it's also helped by the sugar.
"I guess the sugar will help me. it's amazing, I'm so happy."
"you hear that you have a life, work, routines, sometimes you have to wake up, sometimes you have to go to work, sometimes you have to go to sleep. you'll need a shot, and then you'll need more shots throughout the day."
"well, I'm thinking of something. if I'm not drinking sugar, I'm not drinking milk, right?"
yes.
"if I'm interested in a social activity, like squash."
you do something that starts with a start and ends with a finish.
yes.
and then there's also a social aspect.
"yes, and then -"
you'll see some benefits and some fun.
"then, you know, I don't know what period it will be, so I'll go to the doctor and say, ""Test me again."""
it seems like a great plan.
"well, maybe that's true, uh -"
it seems like a good idea.
"maybe it's a good idea. well, I mean, I mean,"
"you have to decide what you're gonna do. start where you want to go. you mentioned some really good ideas about how you might be able to exercise a little bit more, like squash or something like that. you mentioned some really good ideas about reducing the amount of sugar you're taking in the day, and coffee is a good place to start. I think you mentioned it to breakfast, a little bit of fruit."
"yes, as my wife used to. yes."
it's a good idea and a good starting point. then what-- Where are you now. what-what-where-where are you thinking about?
"""actually, it's not a bad idea,"" I thought, ""because it would mean I'd have to socialize harder."". no, no, no, no, no, no, no. well, uh, but, uh, but, uh, but, uh, but, uh. then why not. then why not. maybe it's fun, but it's a new path."
what's the point of losing. what's the point of this?
"I guess there's something to gain, and-- I mean, I-- What do I lose. until I'm done, I don't know. I don't think I'll miss what I don't do if I do what I like. is that what it is?"
"it's true, it's true."
"yeah, I'm fine with it. it's not a-- It's not a--"
you'll gain more than you lose when you look at it.
Billy's a gym guy.
"all right, so let's go"
I have to talk to him because I'm supposed to go to the club tonight.
yes.
"really, really, really, really"
you have to think about these things. the gym where you start.
"yeah, I'd say where you're at now, where you're going, where."
yes.
"-and-and that's what I have to do. I'm in a rut. I'm thinking of that, too, where I'm from."
you were stuck in the car?
I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I
yeah?
"-he says he can handle it, and you seem to think he can handle it."
"in fact, yes."
"well, maybe it's a blessing, actually-"
so instead of--
"""if I'm diagnosed with diabetes, I'll keep on and."""
he's carrying on. He's carrying on.
"""in the corner of the bar, and talk, and talk, and probably eat."". I'm not sure, and I'm sure it's going to be worse. yeah, maybe, maybe, maybe."
"it was a little bit of a shock, but now you think about it."
"all right, that's okay."
maybe it's-
it's really nice. It's really nice.
"-you know, I needed a little shake. maybe I'll be okay. ""what's the problem?"" I might say, ""From your perspective."". everything is fine, everything is fine."
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
"you're thinking, ""Maybe things weren't as good as I thought they were."""
you're right about that. I'm thinking of you just -
maybe things could be better?
"you're going to sit, aren't you. no, actually, it's quite exciting. it's quite a [unintelligible 00:31:28]"
"yes, I'm sure. I'm sure you feel like you're--"
"""oh, I think so,"" I thought."
the idea of--
"yes. it's like a challenge again, like an old challenge."
changing some of the changes. yes.
"it's good. It's good. It. and, uh, and, uh, and"
you want to take on the challenge?
"I'm sure I'm right. ""what do I do here?"" I've never thought about it, but now I'm thinking, ""What do I do?"". why do I like it. why do I have so much fun?"
you know what you were thinking about when you were. you've been a coach. maybe you'll be a coach again.
yes.
"if you were a coach, you'd say something like, ""Right--"""
if I were-
what would you say?
-as if it were?
yes.
"what would I say to myself. you know, I'd say you're happy."
yes.
you're happy with your performance?
"there's a lot of things we need to change, and I guess our personalization is a little like that."
yes.
"we looked at it, and we looked at it, and we looked at it, and we looked at it."
"I think you're right. you're putting them together, and it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it-it-it-it-"
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes"
"all right, let's do it and let's do it."
"I'm good at some things and I think there's something else we're thinking, ""Well--"""
"I'm not gonna give anything up, are I?"
it's not about losing your personality.
"no, no, no, no"
-changing your fundamental nature.
"no, it's not. it's not."
"it's just a little tweak. just a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a. I really enjoyed listening to your perspective, and I've learned a lot about you, and I'm really happy to hear you talk about it, and I'm really happy to hear you talk about it. and we talked about what happens next. you came up with a great idea. you know, before you met the doctor, things were fine."
mm-hmm.
I'll talk about how you feel about it with you today. it's a little bit of a shock at first. it's not what you saw.
"well, I'm sure, I'm sure"
"you said something like, if you look back to where you were before you went to the doctor, things weren't quite so bad. you didn't think so much as you thought."
"now I'm thinking about it, maybe."
yes.
maybe they're right.
"you know, I think it's possible that you could change your habits, rather than bring in broad-brush, you know, big changes to your life. it's not about changing who you are, but maybe a little step that needs to be taken."
"yes, you know - - - - - -"
what you think about what you might.
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry. when your life is over"
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
"you're gonna have a family split, or whatever, and you're not gonna care. you're not interested in yourself anymore, you're just interested in me."
yes.
because everything is just f-
no one's gonna be there.
"no one, it's true and so -"
yes.
"-you know, - you know, -"
I'm sure. I'm sure.
-you're not interested in what I'm interested in
now it's time to go.
so that's why it's [crosstalk]
-to think about taking care of yourself a little better.
"maybe, a little selfish, but maybe?"
then why not?
"then why not. yes, that's a good idea."
"yes. so, I want to ask you a final question, what do you think is next?"
"all right, so what we've been talking about. all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right,. all right, so, so,. no sugar, no sugar, no sugar"
you're going to start with that?
I'll start with you.
yes.
"I'll talk to Bill, uh-"
the gym's in the back.
"-about the gym, but-"
yes.
"-I'd like to do it again, actually-"
yes.
-or something else-or something else-or
yes.
I know it's going to be accepted. I'll be offering my services again -
yes.
-it's pretty successful.
yes.
"well, uh - and, uh - and"
you've also mentioned you might go and- you might go and- you might go and- you might go and-
"all right, I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-"
yes.
-and this and this.
I'm sure. I'm sure.
it's between me and you.
"yes, I'm sure."
"all right, so what do you say"
it's okay. It's okay. It
"but I'm going to do it. all right, so what do you say. as I said, I'll start with the investigation."
sure.
"I'm gonna give up, uh, I'm gonna give up the V drink."
I'm sure. I'm sure.
"-I'd like to have a better wine. [laughter] Um, and-and I-I-I-I-I-I-I-"
you're going to start?
"I'm really interested, but it's really exciting, Mark."
"it's true. It's true. well, because you might have a lot of questions after this session, so you might as well help you."
yes.
I just want to tell you a lot of information that might help you.
not too much.
"it's not too much, just a little bit of information about what you might be able to do."
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes"
-some of the things that have happened to you-
I want to hear a little bit of background.
- Type II diabetes and some -
and what it's about-
[unintelligible 00:36:53] a little bit.
"-because I'm not really sure. yes, yes, yes, yes, yes"
"so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so,. just to see what's going on and-"
"all right, all right, all"
-you see what you've done to the little changes. I'd be really [unintelligible 00: 37: 07].
"what are we talking about, a couple of months?"
it's really up to you. it would be good to be a little sooner.
"what, in a month?"
that would be great.
"all right, I'm ready for it."
how do you feel about it?
"I'm ready for it. yes, now-now that's a little bit of a blockhead."
because you're not aware of the timeline?
"-and I'm fine with it, 'cause, uh, yeah, that's okay."
I'm sure. I'm sure.
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. I'll see you in a month."
yes.
"don't worry, I'm not worried"
"all right, all right, all right,. thank you, Mike. [Croostalk]"
I'm glad you appreciate it. thank you. Thank you. Thank you
"hello, Mr. Stowe, I'm sorry."
"hey, hey, hey, hey"
"how's it going today. I'm Bruce Berger, and I'm here to"
I'm glad you're here. I'm glad you're
I'm a health plan manager. I'm sure you're talking about diabetes today.
"yes. I should learn how to handle it. I've learned that I have diabetes, and apparently, it's pretty bad, 'cause she said my blood sugar was high. it's just so bad and then she said I have to do it. well, I'm a little disappointed right now."
"you know, you've just seen the doctor, and you're like, uh, you're just. you're. you're. you're. you're. you're. you're. you're. you're. you're. you're."
she said my legs were a problem.
"and now you're really reeling from all of this. you're a little scared, too."
"well, that's true. you don't just scare people. I don't want it to happen to me, but then when I'm doing it and I'm like, you know, I don't know if I can even get it. well, I'm thinking, you know, it's going to happen to me."
so it seems to be -
"it's discouraging, just like discouraging."
"what worries you is that she told you everything you were afraid of, and everything that could happen to you, and everything that could happen to you, and everything that could happen to you. it's almost like everything bad is going to happen."
yes. I don't think I can handle this huge task. all of this terrible thing happened to me. it's a bleak situation and much worse.
"all right, all right, all. I want to help you with your blood sugar, so that you can get your blood sugar down. your doctor is right, you know. we want to lower your blood sugar so that we don't have any of those consequences. you have to do a lot of things to get your blood sugar down. well, on the other hand, we can take it slowly, so it doesn't overwhelm us."
"I want to know what you can do now. for example, diabetes needs to be worked out in three ways. take the medication as prescribed. if I were to do something immediately, I'd probably do it first, because it seems so overwhelming. how do you feel so far?"
"since I'm really high blood sugar, I don't think there's much trouble taking the medicine. and-and-and-and"
it's easy to do it.
"yeah, I'm pretty good at taking drugs."
"yes. because, uh, you have to take your medication every day, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,. so it seems like it's possible."
yes. I'm sure I could do it.
"all right, all right, all. you know, you know, you'd change your habits, you know, to eat healthier, you know, not necessarily less, but healthier. and then there would be more physical activity. by the way, it doesn't mean you're going to the gym. it means more walking, maybe using stairs instead of an elevator or escalator. well, uh, uh, uh"
she also mentioned my blood sugar and everything. it's just a lot of mumbo jumbo to me.
"yes. that's really useful feedback to keep you on your way, so that you can keep doing what you want."
"all right, all right, all right,"
"it's really important to know that when you take your medication, when you change your diet, it's really affecting your blood sugar. what's the point of all this - what's the point of what you feel now?"
"well, I'm glad we can do it at a time. it's a relief."
"all right, all right, all"
"I wasn't sure if I could just, wham, put this big program into effect. well, I don't think it's a problem to do a step at a time. I'm pretty sure I can do it."
you seem to be very committed to this.
"yes. I'd be able to do it. as long as there's no big-time side effects, but, uh-"
"all right, Mr. Smith, it's all over your medication."
"all right, all right, all"
blood pressure is a little high.
yes.
"all right, all right, all. I'm wondering if I can talk about your weight."
what's the matter with you?
I'm wondering if we'll talk about your weight for a minute.
"you're kidding, aren't you. I've been here a long time."
yes.
I'm waiting for you in the waiting room.
yes.
"-for 45 minutes, you'll be here."
yes.
it's not acceptable.
yes.
"you know, I'm thinking of you"
yes.
"if I'm working with a client for 10: 00,"
yes.
"-I'm expecting it to be 10: 00, not 10: 45."
"you're busy, and you're busy, and."
"yeah, I have to do something else. I have to do my accounts."
yes.
I have clients coming in.
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes"
"you know, I'm thinking of you"
"you had to wait in the waiting room, and now I'm talking about the weight, and you thought about it, and now I'm talking about the weight."
"all right, I'm fine, I have to have a blood pressure."
"yes, yes, yes, yes."
"-I changed my medication, but I'm not talking about my weight. I know I'm overweight."
"all right, so let's go"
"I know the problems, and I know the solution."
"all right, so let's go"
"well, you know, I'm not really interested in a discussion, you know?"
"all right, so let's go. you came in a little bit of a hurry."
yes.
I'm sorry about the wait in the waiting room.
"well, it's bad form, you know?"
"you know, it's not easy for you, because you want to go really soon, and I'm asking you to spend a minute with me."
"yeah, but I have to do it."
yes.
I have to go back to work.
yes.
I have a lot of work to do.
yes.
-I have to deal with it.
yes.
every day- every minute of my life-
yes.
-means I'm working in the evening-
yes.
-or the weekend.
yes. it's going to be counted.
you don't have a choice when you're self-employed.
"yes, exactly. it's exactly. It's exactly. it's up to you, just a minute."
"all right, if it's a minute, okay?"
"I'm telling you, I promise."
"all right, because I have to go."
I'd like to ask you what you think?
"what, losing weight. of course, I'm interested."
"yes, I'm sure."
"well, who doesn't want to. I know I'm over my weight, but I'm aware that it's causing problems. I'm obviously breathing when I have to do something a little bit like that, and I realize that I'm on my blood pressure."
"all right, so let's go"
"-um, and-and maybe that's why."
"all right, so let's go. you want to see the links between weight and health, and you want to improve."
"yeah, I'd like to keep it, but I mean, yeah, it's a- is a- is a- something I'd like to keep. you're going to be on [inaudible 00: 03: 17]"
"if you could, would you?"
"well, uh, I know, um, a balanced diet, uh, a regular exercise. unfortunately, because of my lifestyle, because I'm a self-employed accountant, I have to exercise, but also, I'm thinking, ""Okay, I'm going shopping."""
yes.
"- ""I'll prepare the food."""
yes.
it's very often with me.
"you have a meal, and you're like that."
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. you know, they're running out of food."
"all right, all right, all right,"
he was gurgling. He was g
"I'll try to summarise what you said, and then we'll see what happens. you're busy with your life."
yes.
"you're running a business, and you have a lot of work to do."
yes.
"yes. you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,"
"well, I'm just a fuel for my lifestyle."
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes"
"you know, I'm thinking of you. I have to juggle all those balls, and I don't want to lose them."
"I'm sure. I'm sure. you'd like things to be different, but it's not easy."
"no, no, no, no"
"all right, all right, all. do you want to talk about it for a couple of weeks?"
"all right, I'll take it, but it's gonna be the same thing, A, finding time."
"all right, so let's go"
"-and B, if I'm able to-"
"all right, all right, all right,"
-I'm not expecting half an hour-
it's exactly. It's exactly
"-or whatever, 'cause it's."
"it's exactly. It's exactly. if you come to the first appointment, I'll tell you what might be a good solution."
that would be good.
"- and then there will be no waiting. you'll see how you feel about how you're going to move forward, and how you can fit in a healthier lifestyle."
"maybe I'll check my schedule, see if there's anything-"
yes.
"-I can arrange it, or I'll give it to you-"
yes.
"-to something that's not a waste of time. I'm going to say, okay, I've looked at my schedule, I've looked at things."
"all right, all right, all"
-whatever.
"all right, all right, all. and see if you can fix it, and also think about what we've talked about."
of course.
"it's a good thing. all right, all right, all"
"all right, thanks. excuse me. I'm a little out."
I'm glad we've figured it out and I'm sure you'll be better in the next couple of days.
"thank you very much, doctor. I'll take it easy for a couple of days."
"I'd like to talk to you about another topic since we're still a minute away. over the last few years, your blood pressure and weight have increased. we don't really have time to talk about it, so I might be able to offer some useful tips. would you like to talk about weight and health?"
"I guess so. I'm a problem with weight, but I'm always trying to lose it. I'm not sure what to do."
I'm aware of what you're feeling. it can be difficult to manage weight. maybe we'll try to figure it out together and I'll help you with the problems.
"all right, doctor, but I'm worried about how I'm going to lose weight now that I'm working so much and the kids are taking a lot of my time."
"of course, it's understandable. we know that there's a lot of things to do with weight, but we don't have to worry about it today, especially since it's so busy for you. maybe we'll think of something small that would fit in with your life and then we can think about what we can do."
"all right, that's great. so what do you think I should do?"
"all right, let's see. active is involved in weight management and health. physical activity benefits the whole body. it's healthy for joints, stress levels, and especially weight loss. maybe we could talk about some ways to add activity that will fit in your life."
"I knew you'd say it, but I don't have a schedule. I'm not going to the gym for an hour."
"all right, I'm sure. I'm not going to the gym every day, but I'm very useful in any activity. for example, let's think of some activities you enjoy."
I'm going to walk.
I'm also thinking of it. it's great exercise to walk.
"wait, you're not going to lose weight, are you?"
"it's really good to walk a couple of minutes, and then when you have time, it's really good. you can go wherever you want, it's not necessary to go to the gym."
"wow, that's really good. you know what. I'm thinking about taking a short walk after this appointment, maybe I'll take a short walk to the park."
it's great. It sounds great.
"and you know what. I've been dancing for a long time, but I haven't danced in a long time."
"it's a great dance, especially if you're having fun."
"well, I'm thinking of something. if I could find a place where I could dance, my family would support me."
"it's great that your family supports you. I'm sure there's a dance class somewhere in the neighborhood, maybe even a dance class."
"yeah, and you know what. I'm really interested in trying it."
do you want to do some research and see what it's like?
"in fact, I'd like to. it's a little exciting for me. what else do you have?"
"it can go a long way to small steps. it can also be a way to increase movement in the day, even if you don't go to the elevator or the elevator."
mm-hmm. I'll do it.
we start with a plan to follow up and then we can discuss some other strategies that might help.
"diet, the word for the word."
"not necessarily. we eat, but we can talk about some small steps that can be taken in your life, and especially ones that you feel good about."
"yes, I'm happy to. all right, I'll go to the doctor's office and I'll start dancing."
that's great. It's great. I'll see you soon.
". so, um, tell me about the exercise."
I've been to the gym a couple of times since we last spoke.
you're here?
I've done it. I've done
it's great that you're doing this.
"well, I'm also a little better in my pants. I'm very happy with it."
so what else did you notice besides your pants?
"well, I'm better now."
mm-hmm.
my back - My back - My back
what. what. what. what. what.
it's not so much of a back.
"wow, that's really cool."
"well, but it seems like it's. but it's still hard. I'd like to go more often or I guess I'm-- I just want to be a little more patient."
mm-hmm. what would you do to help build up to it. you're spending more time there.
"well, I guess I'll stick to it and not get distracted."
mm-hmm.
"I didn't go to the house until Thursday, like last week."
mm-hmm.
-that's how it is - it's a frustrating week like the gym.
mm-hmm.
"I've been busy with a couple of things, but."
"mm-hmm. you've done it, you've done it one time."
I'm. I have. I have. I
-instead of a zero-day.
"yes, and I've been back on Saturday. so, so, so, so"
it's great that you're doing this.
yes.
"even so, it's pretty bad schedule."
"yes. it was a little hectic. well, I don't like it too much because there's a lot of younger guys who can lift more weight than me. because I don't know if you noticed, I'm not. you know, it's a little discouraging to think how much work it's gonna take to get back."
so you want to be buffed?
"you know, when I'm not at the gym, and I'm a normal rational person, I realize that I'm, you know, a little old. then when I'm at the gym, and I see a lot of young guys lift a lot of weight, and I'm like, you know, the urge to be buff is there."
"but at the moment, it seems like."
yes.
"it sounds really good for you, you know, like you're really happy about yourself."
it's true. It's true.
what other positive things have you learned about the exercise?
"I've noticed-- I-I'm still working on my diet. I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I. I'm a little better, but I'd like to do more."
how do you feel better?
"a little less junk food. well, I'm like, ""Oh, I'm thinking of going to the candy bar,"" or something like that, and I'll think about it a little bit before I do it."
so you're thinking about the second part. what would you do if you wanted to?
"I think, uh, when I'm really working hard, it's like I'm thinking, uh, if I'm really working hard, it's like I'm thinking, uh, if I'm really working hard."
mm-hmm.
"""wow, that would be about two hours on the ice cream,"" I'd say, ""wow, that's a lot of ice cream."". then it would be-- that would keep me from actually ordering."
"all right, all right, all right,. the treadmill versus the double-firm brownie is not worth the two hours of treadmill."
"well, what do they call it, decadent?"
"because it's decadent, it's beautiful."
"all right, all right, all"
"yes, sweetie, so-"
"all right, all right, all. but it seems like it's going to be so good. I-I guess, you know, I'm pretty happy with what you're doing. well, I'm really glad we talked about it last time because it was the impetus for me to go to the first time."
"Liz, what do you want to change or what do you think you're thinking about?"
"I'd like to start working again. I definitely want to go back to work, I want to do it, and I'm fine."
"all right, and why would you change it?"
I'm sick of feeling like that. I'm a little sluggish. I'd like to have more energy in the winter.
mm-hmm.
I'm not happy with the way I'm dressed or not dressed.
mm-hmm.
"well, I'm not comfortable with it."
yes. you said you didn't feel comfortable with your clothes.
mm-hmm.
"what's the reason for this change, um, what would you like to do?"
"I've always felt good about exercise. I'm good about myself, and I'm really good about exercise. I'd like to show my kids the best example. it's like they're part of life."
mm-hmm.
"-training. so, I'd like to go back to my usual routine."
so you're going to be a good role model for your kids?
yes.
how would you go about doing it if you decided to exercise more?
"well, I'm not sure. maybe I'll sit down with my husband and try to figure out a good time for me to do it, when he's home with the kids, and I'll try to do it."
mm-hmm.
"to find the time to do it, or what we're supposed to do."
"so, it's a balance between doing something for yourself, but it seems like you don't want to affect your family's routine too much."
"all right, all right, all right,"
"so, how important is it to start exercising more? 1 to 10, 1 to 10, 1 to 10, 1 to 10, 1 to 10, 1 to 10, 1 to 10, 1"
"I'd say 7 or 8, that's what I'm really interested in."
"all right, and how come you don't have a five or six?"
because I'm sick of being fat.
mm-hmm.
"I'm not. I'm not happy to be unhealthy. I don't feel good about it, so I'm motivated to change."
"so, in summary, it's important to do it. you start to feel sluggish, you don't feel good, and you know you have a family watching you, and you want to show them that it's just a part of your family. but you're still struggling with the logistics of when you're supposed to be able to plan your family's time."
"all right, exactly."
what do you think you're gonna do next?
"while I'm still a little bit out, maybe I'll go for a walk or run, um, maybe I'll go to the gym."
that's great. It's great. you seem to have some options and how to get it done.
yes.
"I'm trying to lose the rest of the weight, but I have a lot of trouble. it doesn't matter how much I try to exercise, run, or anything else, nothing else is going to happen."
"you've reached a plateau in weight, despite all the things you try to increase your activity, and it doesn't seem to be working?"
"no, I'm not doing anything wrong, but I'm trying to do it, but nothing happens."
"all right, so let's go. you're doing more exercise, you're doing more exercises, and you don't show any results?"
"yes, I'm sure."
aren't you a little tired of it?
"no one will notice anything when I go home, like, I'll go to the gym and then I'm like, nothing's going on and I'm going home and I'm like, nothing's going on and I'm like, nothing's going on. as far as anyone is concerned, no one wants to support him."
you're thinking of doing this yourself?
"yes, I'm sure."
they're not giving you what you need at home or they'll support you?
"he doesn't want to support me, but he's also not interested in my weight gain."
"all right, all right, all right,"
so I'm. I'm. I
tell me about it.
"it's like I'm losing weight, and he thinks I'm trying to fit in with the perfect American picture and I want to be healthy, and I just want to be healthy."
"hello, Natalie, I'm sorry. I. I'm Dawn, I'm Dawn."
"hello, Dawn. Hi, Dawn. I'm glad you're here. I'm glad"
I'm glad you're here too. thank you for coming.
thank you very much for taking me.
yes. tell me a little bit about yourself.
"so I'm 28, and I'm a little bit of a. six months ago, I was in Arizona. I'm really enjoying spending time with my family and friends. I'm busy working. well, I really want to change my diet and exercise. I thought it would be good to talk about some of this stuff with you, so I came here."
do you feel a little unsatisfied with your health?
"yes. I'm beginning to notice how I feel more sluggish and I'm beginning to think about it, but I'm also beginning to think about it, but I'm also beginning to think about it, but I'm also beginning to think about it, but I"
"you know, you've had a little energy in the past, when you were more active and eating differently?"
"all right, so let's go. yes. the biggest change in energy and mood is usually when I'm more active."
yes. tell me more about the last time you were active.
"yes. well, I've been busy in college, so I've been busy, and I've been really busy, and I'm really happy to do it, and I'm thinking, like, what would I do in 24 hours. it was the time when I was the best physically and mentally when I was at my peak."
"you've got energy, and you're like a rabbit, just keep going and going."
"yes, yes, exactly. it's not the same now. when I'm tired, I'm tired, and I'm tired, and I'm tired, and I'm tired, and I'm tired, and I'm tired, and I'm tired, and I'm tired, and I'm tired,. well, uh, that's probably the biggest problem, uh, when work ends, when I'm not working, I don't really do anything. um, I just want to watch something else, like a Netflix or something?"
"you have a full day of work and a career, and you don't have the energy you used to have. what-- Do you have any ideas about why it's changed?"
"it wasn't really an option to go to college, like, I had to go to school or I had to do it, because that was, in a sense, my life. I-I'm sure it's changed, but I feel like it's not the missing step that I'm missing. it seems like I'm just doing it."
"all right, so let's go. you didn't have to choose whether you wanted to be physically active in the past. you have to look at the last few years and say, I'd like to change things."
mm-hmm.
I'd like to be more active than I used to be.
"yeah, yeah, I'd say so. I don't mean that I want to run a marathon, but I think it would help me a lot if I were to pick up the energy, um, and better outlook on life."
"all right, so let's get. you noticed that exercise has a mood enhancement effect."
mm-hmm.
tell me more about it. what's the mood you're in the day of your physical activity?
"I'm just happy and I'm more upbeat and I think I'm more positive. if I'm sitting in traffic, I'm not going to be active, but if I'm sitting in traffic, I'm thinking about it differently. it's kind of like helping me with the ripple effect on my day."
you're more accomplished and you're less irritated by the little things.
"mm-hmm. yes, exactly."
"all right, so let's get. all right, let's see if I have everything. you've been in Arizona for six months, you've been trying to find a new rhythm and pattern. you've been really active in college, and you've been really active in the last few years, and you've learned that, um, not being, um, not being, um, not being, um, not being, um, not being,"
"yes. and then, uh, I hope that my weight will have some impact on me, and I hope it will help me, um, if I'm going to be able to do it."
yes. tell me more about your weight. when did you start to feel like you weren't good enough?
"I guess it was about three, four months ago. well, I started to wear my clothes, which wasn't so comfortable, and, um, yeah, I've never really been a problem with my appearance, until now. I've been pretty good about it, and then in the last three months, I've been pretty negative about it."
"mm-hmm. all right, so you feel a little less confident in yourself, maybe because you don't have enough physical activity. I wonder if it's also a part of this puzzle since you mentioned that it's been a big difference from what happened in the past."
I don't think so much about the activity and then also the food I eat. I think it's also the same thing to my appearance or my perception.
"all right, all right, all. you've been pretty confident since a couple of months ago, and you've been hoping to get back to that place where you feel good about yourself."
mm-hmm. yes.
"all right, so let's get"
"I've been trying to improve my health habits lately, and my wife is really trying to improve my health. I've worked really hard on this. I don't know what the problem is, but I'm sure it's something to do with Applebee, so I'm going to go to Applebee for lunch, so. but I don't know what the problem is."
"all right, and so what I hear is that you don't feel like you're in danger of health, or anything like that?"
I'm fine. I feel good.
"all right, all right, all"
"I'm usually working in the hot sun, so I sweat out the bad things I've done to my body, so I'm usually sweating."
"all right, all right, all. do you notice you're weighing anything, or anything like--?"
"you know, a little bit, but nothing too much. I don't have any of that, I'm not bloated."
"all right, all right, all. all right, all right, all. and what about the doctor. did you ever visit or visit?"
"yeah, I was at the doctor's last year, but everything was fine, so."
"all right, all right, all. but you're happy to feel good?"
yes.
"all right, all right, all. so what I hear is that you think your wife might be."
"well, I don't think so much of it. you know, she likes me and I know she wants to live, but she's really busy, like, you know, she's like, you know, she's like, you know, she's like, you know, she likes me, but"
"sure. sure. all right, all right, all. if you're interested, I'd like to tell you something, um, maybe a little bit of information about obesity or diabetes. if you're. you know.?"
sure. [unintelligible 00:01:33]
"all right, all right, all. all right, all right, all"
"I hear you're really interested in not giving up these things you want, but to cut back on how much you've got."
"yeah, I'm sure."
"-and that's what it is. all right, let's go. Let. I'd like to ask you a question about the scale, because I hear you feel very important to be there on the high end of the high-end."
yes.
"I'll ask you this question, on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is not very confident, and 10 is like, ""I'm very confident."""
I'm probably-
mm-hmm.
-I'll say six.
"six, I'm counting."
I'm sure it will fall to four when I'm home.
"all right, all right, all. all right, let's go. Let. so, let's talk about it, okay, so we're going to be four."
"all right, so, so,"
all right?
I guess so.
why don't you have four. why don't you have a zero or a one?
"I wanted to do it for years, like-"
"all right, all right, all"
-since I've been conscious of my body.
"all right, all right, all"
"like I've always been a goal for me since I was a kid, like, especially when I was a kid, like, especially when I was playing football, and like-"
uh-huh.
"- hiking, and it's really thin, but really healthy and active."
"all right, all right, all"
"well, I don't really think so."
"all right, all right, all"
I'd like to be-- I'd like to be-- I'd like to be-- I'd like to be really healthy and really active.
"all right, all right, all"
"you know, you can look good."
"all right, all right, all right, all"
I'd like to look good.
"all right, all right, all. so what would help you increase your confidence. it's-- It's like we should focus on that. what will help you feel more confident?"
I'm not really sure-
mm-hmm.
"-really, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. like, I'm sure I'll have to keep telling myself like that."
mm-hmm.
like you wanted it- you wanted it-
uh-huh.
"-for years, I've been thinking about"
uh-huh.
you're capable of it. because like-
"all right, all right, all"
I'm sure I'll do it. I'm capable of anything.
"all right, let's go. Let"
I'm capable of anything-
"all right, let's go. Let"
-I'm sure. but it's hard to get to the point where I'm-
"all right, all right, all"
"-do something, something, something, something"
"all right, let's go. Let. if it's okay, let's take a look at the other time in your life, and let's see what you really wanted to change. what's the matter with you. what strengths did you bring to the table that allowed you to overcome something that seemed like a challenge and-and allowed you to succeed?"
"hello, Liz. Hi, Liz. Hi. thank you for your visit today."
sure.
what would you change or what would you like to change?
I thought about working out. I'd like to start working again. I know I have to do it. it's just motivation to do it.
you've been talking about it a lot lately. I'm really sorry about that.
mm-hmm.
"you have to do it soon because, uh, you're just a lot of talk. then there's nothing to do. I think it's something that needs to be done if you want to see results. stop being lazy and just do it."
"well, I guess I'm not really lazy. it's just that I'm busy."
yes.
"I'm just gonna have to find the time. well, I'm not missing a little motivation, but I'm trying to make it happen."
"I'm sure it's a lot of excuses. you've shared with me before you've had a gym membership. you just have to fit in your schedule. you have to go to work three to four times a week, and you have to really fit in that hour of work, so you have to go to work three times a week."
"but I don't have to do it for three to four times a week, or even an hour. I mean, it's a long hour, so if I'm working, it means I'm leaving home."
mm-hmm.
"-it's going to be a long time, time to. it's not just an hour, it's like two hours."
"you have to put in the time to see the results. if you're going to be two hours, then it's going to be two hours. you have to start, and you have to start now."
"all right, all right, all right, all right, all"
"all right, let's go. Let. all right, I'm looking forward to your next meeting. I hope you'll tell me you went to the gym."
"all right, all right, all"
thank you.
"hello, Mrs. Smith. Hi. Hi. Hi. I'm Denise, I'm Denise. I'm a social worker at the clinic where Dr. Fields and the rest of the team work. I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I. if you're okay, I'd like to know how it's going since you came home."
it's good. It's a good
yeah?
yes. I'm glad I'm here.
yes. what do you really like about it?
"I'm glad I saw my dog, he's really nice, and it's nice to be home."
yes.
"yes. my garden's coming, my neighbors have something. it's good to be home."
"I'm sure you were really. that was your goal. you were able to go home and you seemed to really enjoy it, and I know you've been going to the gym and Tai Chi."
"all right, so, um, so,. this week I didn't go to the gym, and I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I"
"I wonder if something happened to you that you didn't want to go. you're a little, uh, a little down."
"yes. all right, so, um, so,. I-I've had a little bit of a fall, I didn't fall, I didn't fall completely, but I-I-I guess I still have a little bit of a fall. you know, maybe I pushed too hard, and maybe I should have cut it off, you know, and maybe I shouldn't have tried so hard."
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry. you worked really hard on that."
yes.
you've worked really hard to get back.
"yes, I'm sure."
you've been working really hard on both physical therapy and Tai Chi and taking care of your house and everything.
yes.
"you've had a fall or a little fall, and you're thinking maybe you've pushed too hard?"
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes"
yes.
I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. it's a lot of work."
it's beautiful and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and
what's the matter with you?
I'm gonna fall again.
mm-hmm.
"if I don't move, I'm going to fall and hurt myself."
"yes, yes, yes, yes. and- so you're not gonna hurt yourself."
"no, no, no, no"
what are your concerns about what you're thinking about this fall?
"no, I didn't- it's just more scary, and it's like a sign that maybe I'm doing it too much."
mm-hmm.
yes.
"yes. if you're hurt or something, what happens to you?"
"you know, if I fall, I could- anything, you know, really hurt me, and then I'm not going to be able to go home. I'd like to go home. I'm doing what I have to do to-to-to-to stay home."
you can only be safe if you don't do anything to make it feel like you're not going to fall.
"yes. yes, you did very well, you're on your feet."
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes"
"watch the dog and pet him. I-I, I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I"
mm-hmm. mm-hmm.
"I don't know if I'm going to Tai Chi anymore. I-I understand the physical therapy, but I don't know if Tai Chi is."
"yes. you can see that it helps you build strength, which-"
yes.
-maybe this time you might have helped you.
"all right, all right, all right,"
I wonder what you remember about what Dr. Fields said about Tai Chi. did she tell you about it?
"she's done it. She's done. yes, that's right, that's right. she said they've done studies and they found it's really effective. she was really enthusiastic and she's doing it herself."
yes.
yes.
"yes. you feel a little betrayed, like you didn't-- ""Look, I've done it, I've done it, I've done it, I've done it, I've done it."""
"it's a strong word, isn't it. wow, that's really cool. a little, but-but I-I know it's true. she likes it, my friend who's doing Tai Chi. maybe it's not for me."
"all right, so let's go"
"well, uh-hmm, but,"
"you start to think about what it might be useful and what you might be able to do to stay safe, and you know, it's really up to what you decide to do. I want to help you build a plan that will help you feel safe in your home."
"all right, so let's go"
-and to keep you safe and to keep you safe.
yes.
what do you think about that?
"absolutely, I'm-I feel-I feel-I feel-I feel-I feel-I feel"
yes.
"you know, I'm a little scared if I fall and-and-and nobody comes to me. maybe I heard about it."
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes"
"well, 'cause I'm alone."
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes"
so - so - so - so
"you know, it's really hard to believe that you're alone and that it could happen."
yes.
"what do you think about this. what did you hear about others, or what do you think?"
"well, I know people who live in the house, they have a cord they can pull, but how do they get to the cord. if-if-if-if-if-if-if-if-if-if-if-if-"
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes"
-if something happens to you?
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. it's called a lifeline and they can wear it around their neck and it's connected to the phone and so they can call for help."
I've seen something like that on TV.
mm-hmm.
is it really working?
it's really working.
"because they're selling so much on TV, it's like you're selling them."
"all right, so let's go. all right, so let's go"
"it's crazy, it's crazy."
"it's something that there's a couple of different products, but it's really helpful, uh, and-and it's really helpful, uh, and-and it's really helpful, uh, and-and it's really helpful, uh, and"
"yes. I'm sure it's true, I'm a little scared."
mm-hmm.
"-you know, about what's going on and-"
yes.
"so, yes, it's probably a signal to-to make some-some changes."
mm-hmm.
"I'm not going to the hospital, are I. I'm not really interested in it. shall I be?"
"we'll help you stay home as long as you can, and we'll help you if you can."
yes.
"you know what it will take, um, because you know what you feel about the house and what you feel about your security. what do you think about this. you can consider the possibility of a lifeline."
I'm definitely going to do it.
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
I'd definitely do it.
mm-hmm. what else would you have to be safe for?
"they came to me when I was at home, but maybe a refresher, and they said I should be exercised and-and,. it's a little bit, you know, I've moved forward and things have gotten a little better, it's like two steps forward and-"
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes"
"-one step forward, but now it's going to be three steps back. [laughing]"
mm-hmm.
"so, um, is there a way to help. she's very good, but she lives in Seattle."
yes.
-in a distant place.
yes.
and I'm not gonna impose on my friends or my friends.
you want a little help-
mm-hmm.
maybe a little more connection - maybe a little bit more connection.
yes.
-that's what it has to be. do you want to suggest something?
yes.
we can also get some case management services and that might be someone who comes to visit you at home and help you with it.
"all right, so let's go"
"-and, uh, and also, uh, and, uh, and, uh, and, uh, and, uh, and, uh, and, uh, and, uh,. I'm not sure. what do you think it's gonna sound like?"
it's going to be good. should I try to go back to Tai Chi?
"yes, I'm sure. I'd say the other thing I'd say- that I'd consider if I were you- that I'd consider it because you were really active in the senior center."
"yes, it's a great place."
"-and I'm wondering if you're interested in supporting me. there's a lot of activities going on at the senior center, and I don't know what they're doing, but it's really helpful to help with some of that support."
"yes. I guess I've gone a little crazy. I'm usually doing it. [chuckles] Yeah, I'm sure. so, you're moving?"
"yes. it's crazy, right. it's like you feel like you're moving in danger when you feel like it's inside."
yes.
"but we know we can't be perfect, but we know that the more you move and the more active you are, the less likely you are to fall."
really?
"yes, I'm sure."
"all right, all right, all right,"
it's not possible to prevent everything -
uh-huh.
-but we can't be so sure.
"all right, all right, all. all right, all right, all. all right, all right, all. I-I'd like to start again."
mm-hmm.
"yes. it's scary, but it's not a"
yes. it's going to take a lot. it's going to take a lot. you know what you're willing to do to that fear.
I'm willing to deal with my fears and difficulties to be in my house with my dog and my garden. we lived there since my husband and I got married.
"mm-hmm. you have enough motivation to be able to handle that fear, and that's enough to make you want to like it, and that's enough to make you want to like it."
yes.
-a concern about security.
yes. I-I-I-I
yes.
-I'm. I'm. I'm. I. I'm thinking I have some help.
"yes. yes. when you come back, we can talk about it."
"all right, all right, all"
"-and again, and-and-again, and-"
"so, I'm a kid?"
not at all.
"all right, all right, all"
I don't have a baby. it's a pretty normal thing to do.
really?
"-it's normal. It's just a. absolutely. it's a normal thing to feel, especially when you've suffered something and you've suffered it, and you try to get back home and try to get back."
really?
"yes, I'm sure. you've shown me a lot of strength and courage, and you've done it anyway, and you didn't let anyone else do it. you've found a way to get back home and you seem to be really committed to staying home. you have a lot of strength."
thank you. Thank you. Thank you. thank you. Thank you. Thank you
I know Dr. Fields is very interested in this. we'll work together to do what we can.
and she won't let me go to the hospital?
we don't have that yet.
"not yet, but I'm sure it. all right, all right, all right, all. yes. I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I"
mm-hmm.
-about-about-about-about
mm-hmm.
"-well, but, uh, I'm glad I did it. I'm very happy I've done it."
I'm really glad you're here too. it's really nice that we can work together-
yes.
- To help you feel more secure. I hope you feel better today.
yes. so the caseworker will be able to come and refresh.
mm-hmm.
-me? -me? -me
we'll put you in the car.
and-and that's. Yeah.
mm-hmm.
"that alone, to know that I'm communicating with someone I'm afraid of something-"
mm-hmm.
I'd be there and I wouldn't have-
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
-any way to tell anyone.
"all right, all right, all. you have a great plan and we'll see if it's going to work."
"all right, all right, all"
"all right, let's go. Let. thank you."
"hello, Scott, I'm sorry."
hello. Hi. Hi. Hi
"you said you wanted to talk about exercise, and we talked a little."
I'm doing it.
what's going on with this?
"I'm not going to the gym. I've been working a lot, and I've been working a lot, and I've been working a lot. I'm busy, and I'm really, I don't know, I feel like I have to go."
"well, I mean, I think you should sit down and write a list of reasons why you should go to the gym, and then on the other side of the list, you know, you know, ideas."
"all right, all right, all. well, uh, uh, uh. all right, let's go. Let. um - - - - - -"
what gym do you belong to?
I'm a gym at the gym.
"all right, all right, all. and-and how far are you from home?"
it's just a couple of miles.
"it's just a couple of miles. I'm sorry, but I'm sorry. you could go to the bike or walk, and it would be too."
"I'm sure I wouldn't even need to go to the gym if I were so far, right?"
"well, I'm not sure about that. well, uh, uh, uh. - You know, it's really important that you don't just have your heart, but also, you know, your weightlifting, the [inaudible 00:"
[inaudible 00:01:33] training.
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes"
it's important. It's going to be important.
"yes. why-why do you want to. what do you want to do. you're gonna change, or.?"
"I-I-I-I'd be better. I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-. I grew up in the middle, and I wanted to go back to my old place, you know, 34, 36."
"all right, all right, all"
I'm more comfortable - I'm better. that's the main thing.
"all right, all right, all. well, I think it's more important than your-your health. you know, I understand what you're saying, but I'd like to go back to those jeans, but."
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. I-I'm not gonna be younger than I [unintelligible 00:02:18]"
"mm-hmm. all right, I'm sure you know what to do. you've done it before."
yes.
yes. just a question - you have to.
I have to make time.
yes.
I have to make time.
"yes. so it could mean, you know, you'll sleep an hour earlier, you'll be there an hour earlier, and you'll go there and do it. that's what I'm doing."
"yes. all right, all right, all"
yes.
"all right, let's go. Let"
"you know, I'd like you to try to get up an hour earlier, 'cause, uh, you know, it's more important to be healthy. well, I know it's important to sleep, but."
"all right, all right, all"
all right?
"all right, all right, all"
"okay, so next week I'll see you."
"all right, all right, all. well, I'm glad you're here. thank you."
"all right, let's go. Let. all right, let's go. Let. good-bye. Good-bye."
thank you for coming. what have we been talking about since we last spoke?
"well, I've been offered a job. um - - - - - -"
"wow, that's great. It's really nice."
"well, I couldn't go because my kids, I didn't have anyone to look at them. well, uh, so it's a game over. I'm sorry, but it was a bad interview, and it was a job that would have been good, but I don't know."
"you're disappointed, aren't you?"
"yeah, because it's- it's, you know, I didn't have a choice. first I have to take care of my kids. I'm afraid it's going to happen."
you'll keep turning down opportunities.
yes.
"all right, all right, all right, all right, all. how important is it to have a job?"
"well, you know, it's a little bit of a 10 because, you know, I'm the only one who supports my kids. I'm really looking for work soon."
yes. you-you-you-you-you-you-you-you
yes.
you're supposed to take care of your kids.
mm-hmm.
how confident are you that you'll be able to do it?
"I'd say I'm at 3 right now. you know, even if I'm able to go to the interview and I'm supposed to be able to take care of it, you know, it's not impressive and it's got a lot of gaps. I'm just thinking, um, I don't know, I'm not."
"so, it seems like the issue of childcare has gotten in the way, and so finding something that would be useful to you would be useful."
yes.
and you seem to have a little bit of a bad feeling about your resume and your experience.
"yes. I mean, it's not something I want to lead to the job I want, but it's not something I'd like to do, but it's not something I'd like to do, but it's not something I'd like to do, but"
"all right, all right, all. what do you want to do?"
I want something that's- is going to be- is going to be- is going to be- is going to be- is going to be- is going to be- is going to be- is going to be- is going to be-
yes. yes. you'd change your life a lot if you had a job.
yes. it's going to be big.
mm-hmm. you'll get the money you need and you won't be afraid of it.
yes. I'd like to know what I'm doing and just have my routine.
"all right, so let's go. you know where you're going every day."
yes.
"all right, all right, all. what's going on today, for the week."
"all right, so let's go. you know, it would be good if I knew my kids were taken care of."
yes.
- I don't worry about them when I'm working.
"all right, so let's go. yes. you're a parent who wants to make sure your kids are doing well."
"all right, so let's go"
"yes. what would it take to be a five in confidence, to feel a little more confident about getting a job?"
the priority would be to interview.
"all right, all right, all right,"
"you know, you're taking care of yourself, you're taking care of your kids."
mm-hmm.
- I'm going to call someone I trust when I know I have an interview.
yes. you have to go to the interview to get the job.
"all right, so let's go. yes."
it would definitely help if I took care of this part.
yes.
what else would you get for five?
"I'd like to- I'd like to- I'd like to- I'd like to- I'd like to- I'd like. everyone seems to have a college degree, but I don't have it on my resume."
"all right, all right, all"
I'm asked about education and training and -
"mm-hmm, mm-hmm."
"I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just"
"all right, all right, all"
- I'm not gonna have that.
"maybe a certificate of some kind of field you'd like to be proud of, if you had something on your resume."
"yes. I'd like to talk about something in the interview. even if I'm a certificate, I can say, I can, you know, with confidence talk about it."
"mm-hmm. all right, all right, all. what-- what ideas do you have about what you'd like to learn more about?"
"I guess, I guess, I'm just not really sure what it's gonna be."
as fast as it will be.
"all right, so let's go. you know, I'm not going to school for four years, so I'm not really interested in what I'm interested in."
"all right, and if you were, you'd probably do something you wanted to do quickly like a short certificate."
"you know, something that would, you know, give me immediate skills that would, you know, give me a job, even if it wasn't my long-term goal or, you know, career."
"yes, it's a short-term or transition to something else."
"yes. all right, so let's get. it's exactly. It's exactly"
but it's going to be steady and it's going to be good
mm-hmm.
"all right, and you'll be able to afford everything you need."
"yes, because I don't feel like I have access to these jobs. you know, it seems like-- maybe if I were better on the computer."
"all right, so you'll help with computer skills?"
yes. I don't have anything on my resume that would be useful to--
the technology.
yes.
"mm-hmm. all right, all right, all. you really need money and you really need to take care of your kids and it sounds like you have some ideas about how you're going to do it."
yes.
"well, maybe even a certificate or a computer training?"
it would be great.
"all right, all right, all"
that's great. It's going to be great
what do you think you're gonna do next?
"well, you know, you're looking for the resources to"
"all right, all right, all right,"
- It seems to be- It seems to be-
it's a priority.
because I'm not gonna interview without it.
yes.
"you know, I guess it's a training program that's short-"
yes.
"- I mean, maybe it's a weekend, like."
"hello, Hannah, I'm sorry. I'm glad you're here. I'm glad"
hello. Hi. Hi. Hi
I understand that your GP referred you to me because you had some anxiety problems.
"yes. yes, it's been five, six years since I started."
"all right, all right, all"
"well, it's a little escalated. I moved out recently, um, with my parents. I think it's just a little worse."
"all right, all right, all. are you leaving home for the first time?"
"yes, I'm- Yes. it's the first time I've ever done it. I've been thinking about it a couple of years ago. so I thought it would be easier to stay at home."
"all right, all right, all. it's a big step, a big change, and it seems like it's what led you to the doctor."
yes.
how did that change things for you?
"well, I didn't tell anyone, so, I mean, it's better. I'm hoping it's like that, but I don't know. I'm not thinking about it, I'm thinking about it. if that makes sense, I never thought I'd be someone you'd like to help."
"all right, all right, all. how do you feel about being here today?"
it's like I'm scared. I'm not sure. I hope it'll help you.
"all right, all right, all. you feel a little nervous today."
yes.
"all right, all right, all. I guess you're just going to go back to what you've done with the GP and how you ended up here. you seem to have experienced a lot of anxiety for a long time. well, you've been in the house for the first time in a long time, and that's what led you to go to the doctor. how did it change things. how's it going after you've left?"
"well, I thought they'd be better, but I guess I'd be a little more independent and I guess I'd be a little worse. I'm staying in the house a lot. I'm not really friends. I'm visiting my family a little bit, but it's not. it's a little scary because I've always thought I'd like to go alone, but I don't really like it."
"all right, all right, all. what other problems have you had?"
"well, I'm a photographer. I'm a little worried about my job, so I'm a little worried about my job, so I'm a little worried about my job. in that respect, it was a little hard, and um, it was a little friendly. I'm more and more alone. you know, it's kind of stopping me from making friends and, you know, relationships."
"all right, all right, all. you said you were getting in the way of things. so they're stopping you from taking a certain kind of job and as a freelance photographer, I guess it's a problem. they also stop you or you'll be a problem, uh, socially. you don't have a new friend or meet someone new."
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. I mean, it's much easier when I'm at home, because I'm obviously, you know, my parents, so it's okay, but you know, they're going to places, so it's okay. I've been talking to my friends for a couple of weeks and I've been thinking about going home. I'm not interested in that, I just don't want it to happen. I'm not interested in losing anyone. so-so-so-so"
you're kind of worried about where it's going to go.
"yes. yes, yes, yes, yes, yes"
"five or six years ago, you noticed the anxiety."
yes.
you'd be 19.
yes.
what's going on now?
"well, a year before I finished school. I mean, I've always been a little shy, but I've never really been, uh, like, not as much as it was, but I've never really been, uh, like, not as much as it was. I've stopped going to the party, and I'm not sure if I should have done something or not. I really like photography, but I'm not working much, so I'm kind of."
what's the hardest job for you?
"I guess when I'm working with someone else. well, I'm not really happy about that. it's like when I'm trying to do something like a big event, not just photographers, but real, you know, if I'm like taking places with people I don't know. I'm not gonna do it."
"then I guess, tell me more about what's going on. so let's focus on the fact that you might be invited to work with, uh, you know, it's going to involve, uh, photography with a group of people. what do you think about?"
"I'm really hot and sweaty, and I'm not. I feel like everyone is looking at me and thinking I'm really stupid, and I'm really hot. I'm just an idiot. well, I mean, they think I'm a weirdo and I'm just trying to focus on something else. so I'm doing shots where I'm just myself and the camera, so I can focus on it."
"all right, all right, all. then you think, ""People will look, people will stare, people will think I'm crazy."". so what you think the other people will think is quite a lot. how do you feel about it?"
"it makes me feel like an idiot, and I don't want to try to do it any more. I'd rather go home and I'd rather not be in this situation. I'm just like everyone else, they're fine and they're normal, and I'm just crazy, like you can't do anything, like you're normal."
"all right, all right, all. do you have any examples of recent events. maybe we'll focus on that."
"um, like a job or."
"you know, you've been in a job, and you've felt a little social anxiety, and you've felt the kick."
"yes. I've done a lot of work where it's kind of like a nature issue and I have to work with a lot of people. I thought it would be okay when they told me about the job. I thought it was just a couple of photographers, but there were actually people and, you know, I took pictures of people in the trees. I guess they're asking me to."
it's quite interesting. wasn't it a fashion show or something?
"yes. yes. it's just a fashion thing. I don't know if it was a campaign or something, but, it was-"
"all right, all right, all"
"yeah, it's really nice, but I'm really worried about it, 'cause I feel like I'm a little nervous and."
so you're not expecting this?
"no, no, no, no. no, no, no, no"
how long have you been?
it's been two weeks since then.
"all right, all right, all. so it's been a long time."
yes.
what thoughts did you have on that day?
"I'm really hot. I'm not really breathing, and I'm just thinking of getting out. I've been really trying to focus, and I've been thinking a lot, and I just wanted to focus, but I just wanted to focus, but I just wanted to focus, but I wanted to focus, but I wanted to focus, but I"
"even just thinking about that day, I'm a little worried."
yes.
"all right, all right, all. you're telling me a lot about it. you said you were sweaty and hot, and you said you were holding the camera."
yes.
"what, do you want to hide behind him or not?"
"I've just tried to focus on it. I thought if I held it tight, it would just be. I could just focus on it and I could handle it."
you hold the camera tight.
yes.
why did you do it. why did you help me?
"I thought I was going to be really hot and flushed, and I thought, at least if I can--. it's weird, but I'm trying to keep my hands on him. because I was sweaty and sweaty, and I thought if I held it, it wouldn't be so obvious, but I just thought if I held it, it wouldn't be so obvious."
"all right, all right, all. all right, so, so, so,. you seem to have had a lot of ideas. you're afraid everyone will look at you. what else did you think about?"
"I just, I was just, I was just, I was just, I was just, I was just, I was just, I was just, I was just, I was just, I was just, I was just, I was just,. then what did she do?"
they could tell you what they were saying.
I'm just really sweaty and.
everything they saw was all-everything.
yes.
"all right, all right, all"
"well, I was trying to cover it up, so it's like a lot of layers, so they can't tell, but my hands, like, they were shaking. I'm really red, and I'm just. I wish I wasn't there."
"how did you describe it to me, how did you think you looked?"
"I'm really red, like, I'm really red. I knew I was sweating and shaking, like I was shaking my hands. um, and, uh, it's definitely, uh, very visible. everyone would have seen it."
"all right, what-what did you do to-- How did you try to hide it?"
"I'm trying to grab the camera again, but I'm trying to keep my head down, but I'm trying to keep my head down, but I don't want to do anything weird."
"you've avoided looking at people. in preparation, you wore black."
"yeah, I-I'm always doing it, even if it's hot or I'm wearing a lot of layers and I'm just like, people would see it."
"all right, and how did it go?"
"well, it's been a couple of hours, and then, uh, people went out for a drink after the shoot, and then, uh, they were celebrating like that we did it. I just- I'm going home right now, I'm driving, and I'm going home. after they saw me being weird, I wanted to go home immediately."
"all right, all right, all"
"I knew I'd screwed up, and I knew I'd be drunk. I'm completely out of my mind."
how did you know you've done it?
"because I'm right there. I've been there when I came home and I took a couple of pills, and I wanted to stay there. I'd like to stay here exactly. I've just been thinking about how I ruined everything. Erin's using the phone now, and I'm like, uh, I'm a little embarrassed, but I'm glad I didn't feel like it."
"did something happen, um, where you were in danger of something important. when you said you felt guilty, you felt bad about talking to Erin?"
"because of what-- Yeah, I guess, I think it's what I meant. I could have stayed, I could have stayed, I could have stayed, I could have stayed, I could have stayed."
you've seen yourself risking something important to you.
"but I guess I'm stopping because I'm afraid I'll stop, you know. well, I'm just, uh-- [crosstalk]."
"you've been here for three months, you've been here for three months, you've been really good, uh, you've been really good."
"they're better, yes."
"yes. you know, it was a red light, and then you saw the kids, and it was a little scary, but it was a little scary, and it was a little scary, and it was a little scary, and it was a little scary,"
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes"
"I'm glad you came today to see me. I'm sure you have a lot of work to do, you have a lot of things to do. do you have a little bit of information?"
"well, I've been working full-time at a restaurant, and then recently, I've been working on my son, so you know, I've been working on my job, so I've been working on my job, so I've been working. I-I feel a little stressed lately."
"yeah, I'd say that. um, do you have a mom?"
yes.
"you have a lot of stressors. you have a two-year-old, you work, you're working, you go to school. what would be the best thing to focus on today?"
I'm sure I'm the biggest problem right now with my kids.
"all right, all right, all. do you have a little bit of information?"
"yes. well, my mom's usually watching my son, but lately, it's kind of a problem. she's going to be back in the last minute, and I have to call her at work. I missed a couple of times. you know, I'm worried about whether I can do it or not."
"all right, all right, all. I hear you say your mom isn't ideal. you've missed a lot of classes and you've lost work shifts, and that's a problem."
"yes, exactly."
"all right, all right, all. anyone else who can help with your mom?"
"I'm not really sure what to do, but I have a sister, but I'm not really sure if she'll help me, and I don't really know anyone. she's got a three-year-old daughter, so you know, it's pretty much worked out."
"all right, all right, all"
"well, I don't know her very well, but I think she did a pretty good job."
"well, I'm thinking of something. when you needed her, the neighbour was supportive."
yes.
"last minute, I stepped in. you didn't worry about your son when you took him?"
yes.
"all right, all right, all. let's go for a little neighbour. I know, I think of it as natural resources, but I know for many people, the biggest problem is the cost of childcare."
yes.
"if you can afford to pay someone to watch your son, have you thought about what you'd be able to afford?"
"you know, maybe a little bit, but I don't really have much money to spend on daycare or, you know, like a full-time babysitter."
"yes, I'm sure. what are your natural skills?"
"well, I-I'm really fond of cooking. I'm actually in school for culinary arts."
"I'm sure you're a great cook. what would you say to a plan where you're working with your neighbour, and you're going to give her a look at your son, and you're gonna prepare dinner for her and her daughter?"
mm-hmm.
maybe you'd like to take care of the kids. what do you think about the idea?
"well, I'm thinking of something. that's interesting, that's really interesting. I didn't think about it, but, yeah, it might be possible."
"all right, all right, all. all right, I'm glad you think so. well, besides the neighbour, or anyone else who could help you?"
"well, I'm thinking of something. no, I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I"
"all right, I'll take it. you have to take your gut and your own intuition. what about the father of the baby?"
"no, no, no, no. since my son was born, he's not in the picture."
"all right, all right, all right,. you know what. we have a good lead on the neighbour. you might find some relief and resolution of your child care problems if you follow up. how many days a week do you work?"
"I have a class on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday night."
"all right, all right, all. so what if you had a plan where both your neighbors and your mom helped you?"
I think it would help my mom a lot if my neighbour would only watch my son for a day.
"all right, all right, all. so you're saying if you could reduce the amount of time you need your mom, she might be more supportive, more willing to help you?"
"yeah, I'd say so."
"all right, let's go. Let. so what do you think will be the next step in the plan between your neighbour and your mom?"
"you know, I guess talking to my neighbour and seeing if she's interested in it, and if she is, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you"
"all right, all right, all. you seem to have a good plan. all right, let's go. Let. you've mentioned your son's two. when will he be three?"
it's going to be a couple of months. he's almost three.
"all right, all right, all. well, in that case, I have a new idea. you might want to take him to Head Start when he's three. do you know the program?"
"I heard about it, but I don't know much about it."
"all right, all right, all. the Head Start program is a very good, high-quality preschool. it's just like your parents and your family, who have less money and less resources, but they're preparing your child for school. you know, before he starts kindergarten, you might find that routine is something that's better for him to learn before he starts kindergarten. do you want to know more about the local Head Start?"
"you know, it's definitely going to help my son and, you know, it's going to help me with my kids."
"all right, all right, all. all right, so, so, so,. all right, so, uh, so, uh. you seem to have a good plan. you've also been working on reducing smoking and drinking, so I've seen your notes from the nurse. how's it going?"
"I've been working on it for a couple of weeks, and honestly, it's been a lot harder than I thought. it was hard, but, um, I've been trying to break my habits in the evenings, especially, you know, I've been smoking a lot of cigarettes. well, I've done okay, but I've done it a little bit."
"all right, all right, all. you said it was a bigger challenge than you thought, but you're working on it. you still have it in your heart. well, that's really commendable. but I'd like to ask you one thing. do you think about the risks of secondhand smoke and the impact on your son?"
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. I'm definitely smoking around him, and if I smoke at home, I'm always smoking on the balcony."
"all right, all right, all right, all right. you know, I'm sure you have a son's best interest. I can tell you, you're a really good mom. so, let's take a look at what we've been talking about. between the neighbour and the nursery program, we have a couple of good options. what are your next steps to get this going?"
"well, I guess I'll talk to my neighbour first, and then I'll talk to my mom. I hope it helps her. I definitely want to look at the idea of Head Start because I think it would be really good."
"all right, all right, all right,. all right, all right, all. you have a good plan. if you have something to do, you know, if you have something to do, you know, if you have something to do, you know, if you have something to do, you know, if you have something to do, you know, if. we'll come up with a new plan."
"all right, all right, all"
"all right, let's go. Let. all right, all right, all. Sarah, I'm glad you came today. it's really nice to meet you."
"thank you. all right, let's go. Let"
you're very welcome.
"hello, Emily. Hi, Emily."
hello. Hi. Hi. Hi
it's been a long time.
"yes, it's been a long time."
it's a new thing.
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,"
you've got a broken lip. how long have you been working?
"a month ago, a month ago."
"well, I'm thinking of something"
yes.
why did you decide to have a piercing?
"well, I'm not sure. I've just been thinking of something else. I'm bored, and I guess it's a good thing to stand out."
"well, I'm thinking of something"
"yes, change."
"yes, and it's nice."
thank you.
"I have a couple of concerns about piercings, piercings, piercings. I'm wondering what you've heard about how oral piercings can affect your teeth or gums?"
"I'm not really, really. I guess it's gonna hurt my gums or teeth, but I don't know how much. I have good teeth. I'm not sure."
mm-hmm.
I'm not really sure what it is.
"you're right. You're right. I always tell you, you have beautiful teeth."
[laughing] Thank you.
-every time you're in the room.
yes.
"well, I've had a couple of patients who have pierced their teeth and they can destroy the gum."
mm-hmm.
"well, that's one thing, and the other is, uh, I'm seeing a lot of chipped teeth."
"yes, I'm sure."
-only contact with him. I'm wondering what you think about it?
"I'm definitely not gonna mess with my teeth. I've been telling you for a while, and I'm supposed to floss, which I-"
"yes, you're flossing."
"well, I guess I don't really want to destroy my teeth, 'cause. Yeah, I didn't really notice any of the cracking."
we don't have anything yet.
I guess I won't be paying attention.
"yes. you, as you said, only had it for a short time."
mm-hmm.
what do you think is right about this?
"I guess if I start to see it as a problem, then I'll start to think about it."
mm-hmm.
but I'm just-
mm-hmm.
-and it's really cool.
I'm sure it's true.
"yeah, I'm a little-- Yeah."
"yes, it's nice. so, you're gonna keep an eye on him and-and-"
yes.
-really look- -really look- -
yes.
"-the effect. all right, all right, all"
"yes. I guess if I really start to see a problem - I mean, I hope it doesn't last forever, but my teeth."
mm-hmm.
-it's kind of a stick [unintelligible 00:02:30]
"you've said so well, Emily."
yes.
"-the piercing may not last forever, but your teeth are-"
yes.
"-hopefully forever. all right, thanks for the talk-"
yes.
"-I'm always on your case when I'm doing the exam, so maybe we can take it together."
so we can take a lot of different ways. you mentioned wanting to change your physical activity. you mentioned wanting to change your diet and also want to be more confident about your body. what- what about the rest of the session?
"I'm thinking of the activity piece, which is a little low-hanging fruit. I'm thinking about changing my diet habits, but if I can get into a routine, that might be good for me to change my habits."
"yes. all right, all right, all. the easiest change to look at is physical activity."
"yeah, I'm sure."
"all right, so let's get. tell me a little bit more about your motivation for starting to exercise. I know you've shared energy levels and I know you've shared, um, you want to feel better and less irritable. any other benefits that would make you want to change?"
"yeah, I'd say it's just to feel stronger, like physically stronger. I was struggling with salsa last night. you know, I think it would be more like mood and productivity and energy and all that stuff. yes, I'd also be a definite goal. I think my body image or my confidence would improve if I were more active."
yes. you want to feel stronger so you can open the jars and other things and- and also feel more confident.
mm-hmm.
"all right, so let's get. so on a scale from zero to ten, zero is not ready to change the physical activity in the area. I'm very happy to be here. I'm ready. I'm ready. what's the scale of this scale?"
I'd say I'm eight.
"all right, all right, all. you feel pretty motivated."
mm-hmm.
why don't you pick a six?
"as I said, I've identified a lot of things that I think would be good. if I'm more active and I want to improve my mood and energy, I definitely want to improve my mood and energy. all of those things I think are driving the rating."
"all right, all right, all. you noticed that, um, you know, being physically active and, um, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,"
mm-hmm.
do I have anything else to miss?
I'm not sure.
"all right, all right, all. it's the big ones."
yes.
"it's great. It's amazing. well, um, now we're gonna look at what you might want to do."
"yes, mmm-hmm."
- and what activities you might choose.
it would be great.
"all right, all right, all"
"thank you, Tanya, for talking to me today. what would you like to change about yourself or something in your life that you might have been a little ambivalent about?"
"well, I'm a little worried, and so I'm taking a test. it's a big test and I'm kind of afraid of it. I'm not going to do it well. it's something I've been thinking about for a long time, and it's like I've been thinking about it for a long time. well, I'm always afraid of it, but I always stop. I'd like to, I'd like to feel better."
yes. you don't feel confident that you can do it and you don't feel confident that you can do it.
yes.
"so, it's easier for you to not do it."
it's exactly. It's exactly. so I'm avoiding it and I'm postponing it.
"yes. so, on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 is not confident, 10 is very confident. do you feel confident that you'll be able to handle the anxiety on this exam?"
maybe a 4 or 5.
"all right, all right, all. so, four, five, four, five. how it's not like a two or three."
"I mean, I've been so worried about it for so many years, but I think I'm pretty good at it, so I'm like, first step. I'd say it's a 4 or 5 because I'm the first one to make it, but it's still scary."
yes. you've also mentioned that you've actually taken the exam you have to take.
yes.
before you've done it.
"yes, I'm sure. after the scheduling, I've already been pretty much in the back. well, I'm actually enjoying it because I've changed my date and everything. so now it's going to happen."
"all right, all right, all. you've been planning this appointment for a long time and anxiety has taken over where you've planned to go."
"yes, I'm sure."
it seems a little different this time. why do you think you might not be able to postpone this time?
"well, I'm sure it's going to be a long time. I'll do it and then I'll know if I'm not going to pass, so I'll wait three months. I'll be studying for the next three months. if I'm doing it, I'll lift the weight off my shoulders because I've been carrying it all day and I think about it. I just want to think about it."
that's really encouraging you to think about how good you'll be after it's done and you're done with it.
"yes. but I'm worried about negative talk, you know, when you're worried. then I'm worried if I'm not going to pass it, and if I don't, I'm embarrassed. well, that's why I'm really worried."
"yes. you'd rather avoid it. yes. if you don't have them, you can have them."
"all right, so let's go"
I'd like to hear from you. when did you feel anxious about something and you actually did it?
"I've done a recording for work a couple of years ago, and I didn't want to do it. during the recording, I tried to find all the ways I could escape. well, I'm not always confident and I'm very anxious, so I'm not always sure about other people."
"and so, um, when I played the recording, it was actually the best recording and I was very impressed by it because I was so much like a supervisor and our national adviser. I thought, I'm not really happy about compliments that make me nervous, but it was a nice feeling. I've done a good job."
yes.
I was happy for him.
"you really built your self-confidence and you almost didn't only change your view of yourself, but maybe how others saw you and you liked it."
"yes, I've done it."
"yes. you must have really brave to do something so daunting at first, but you've done it really well."
yes.
how do you think you'd relate to what you're doing now?
"I mean, I'm thinking of the same anxiety I've had with those tests. and so, um, but if I'm going to pass this test, I'd like to feel like I did a good job."
mm-hmm-hmm-hmm
"you know, I'm thinking of you"
you can create opportunities to create those moments that you can feel again
"all right, all right,"
you've also mentioned that you're proud of yourself.
yes.
"how do you think we can end the conversation. you've said you were four or five, what would you say to be more confident?"
"well, I think my confidence will go up a little bit, just like I'm going to practice and see how I'm doing and if I'm good, then I think my confidence will be a little higher."
mm-hmm-hmm-hmm
"you know, maybe I'll just have faith in myself that I can do it, you know, instead of just thinking I can't."
so you can really take a positive self-talk?
yes. mm-hmm.
"so, in summary, you've been a little worried about the test, you've rescheduled it, um, in the last couple of years. but you're more confident this time. you mentioned times in the past when you were worried and you were successful in it and you felt proud of yourself. you liked the way you looked, and you thought about how others saw you, and you thought you'd be successful?"
yes.
"all right, all right, all. thank you, Tanya."
thank you. Thank you. Thank you
mm-hmm.
"all right, so, um, we're here today to talk about what you want to talk about."
"well, um, if we're talking about the problem I have, it's, uh, that I'm really interested in, um, someone who wants to move out of my house."
"so, um, so, um, so, um, so, um, so, um, so, um, so, um, so, um, so, um, so, um, so, um, so, um, so, um"
"I've offered someone my house, you know, uh, for a transition period."
mm-hmm.
"well, I don't think it's easy to be assertive and say I think the transition period is- is beginning to be. so, so, so, so"
"it's really nice of you to do something like that to someone who needs help. you know, you think it's time to move on, you know, you're ready to move on, you know, you're-you're ready to move on."
"yeah, I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I. you're right, you're right. I want to be able to do it."
"mm-hmm. what would help you to get to the point where you actually, uh, would have taken them?"
"well, uh, uh, uh. I don't know, I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-"
"mm-hmm. you're thinking about it in two ways. you want to, um, you want to, um, you want to know that the person is going to be there, and on the other hand, you know there's a certain amount of security."
"yeah, you know, it's kind of like a song about Jack, don't go on, don't go on, don't go on, don't go on. [laughs] And - and - and - and"
you don't really want to sing this song.
"if I started singing this song, he would have started on the road. [laughing]"
"I'm really glad you did a good job singing there, it's really scary to me, I appreciate it."
"you know, in life, you have to have a sense of humor, you know, like I'm thinking and so on. [laughs] I mean, it's either."
it's really helpful if you can laugh about it.
"well, I mean, I'm sure there's a lot of comedians who say, you know, they're really not happy, and they use it as a joke. I'd like to go in there. as a girl - like this girl."
you're going to have a new career.
"yeah, like the girl Ruth I know she's really busy and she's doing it on the side. [laughing]"
"so, um, what would you say to the benefits of having him out of the house?"
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry. let's see. Let's see. Let. I don't really know, you know. well, I have a problem with it. well, uh, uh, uh"
tell me more about it.
"well, I'm really thinking about it, 'cause-"
is there a little guilt?
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. I'm a little bit of a guilt, you know, you know, I'm a little bit of a guilt."
uh-huh.
yes.
"you want to do it for the right reasons, because you're a good person and that's a very important value to you."
"yes, I-I- I- I- I- I. thank you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm glad you're saying I'm a good guy. as I'm thinking about it, I feel like I. um - - - - - -"
"you did your duty, but you did it. we have to do it. We have to do"
"yes. oh, my God, it's just hard to, uh, uh, yes. I- I'm done with my job, and I have to realize that I have to be a little more assertive, and I think I'm a little more confident."
"so, what did you do to get them to go, Jack?"
"well, I've had a couple of conversations with him and sometimes I don't like it, but I'm-I'm just saying, you know, 'cause I like to hold things. you know, I've been really logical about it. I've been a little bit of a logical guy the last couple of days."
"all right, all right, all"
[laughing]
you've told me before that you've talked to someone else and he's got some options for other places.
yes. that's what he's doing well. I've mentioned them to you. I've been talking to him about it.
mm-hmm.
"that's a relief for me. you know, I don't just say yes. I mean, I feel better about it and that it's easier to discuss and that's something I'm more comfortable with."
you might have to help him pack his bags and help him get there.
"I've been there, I've done it. [laughing]"
"all right, all right, all. you've done it before."
yes.
so when-when-when do you want to?
"well, in a couple of days, I told him. well, I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I. I've been here for seven years, but I don't know. we're going down a new, uh, winding path every day."
"mmm, mm-mm, mm-mm."
"well, uh, uh, uh"
it's a little scary.
"oh, my God, yes, yes. but, you know, it's scary to have a big extra trunk."
and he's the extra trunk.
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes"
"all right, all right, all"
"but I-I mean, I care about him, but I don't. we're all adults here, so we're all here."
"all right, all right, all. all right, let's go. Let. you've actually worked it out for a couple of days."
"well, that's what we're aiming for."
"all right, all right, all"
"I'm not sure what his plans are, but I'm planning on it."
"all right, all right, all. I'm sure your plans will prevail. [laughter]"
"I'm glad you think like that, girl. I'll tell him. [laughing]."
thank you for talking and playing with us.
thank you very much.
"well, I guess the problem is that my doctor thinks I have a little high blood pressure, but I don't think so. well, I'm really good at eating. well, uh, uh, uh. she said, um, I'd like to watch my caffeine, but I don't have a problem with it."
"all right, all right, all. you said you felt like it might cause you a little trouble, but you said you felt like it might cause you a little trouble. so, I don't know what. um, so where are we. do you feel like you're having a little trouble with coffee, or is it just not a problem?"
"well, sometimes I'm a little nervous and, you know, I have to go to the bathroom more often than some of my colleagues, but. you know, it's just that I'm awake, I'm aware, I'm more able to do my job. and so I'm not really sure it's a problem."
yes.
"well, I'm a little high blood pressure, but."
"yes. so I'm gonna check if I have it. so you've got some positive, awareness, and then you feel like you're playing?"
mm-hmm.
"well, then there's some negative things about your co-workers, um, that they don't, you know."
"all right, so let's go"
-on the floor of the hospital.
"I have to stay here, of course."
"yes, yes, and then the blood pressure. is that what you think is right?"
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. well, sometimes I'm a little nervous and, uh, I don't know. I don't feel as happy and relaxed as I normally do. I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I"
yes. how about frequency. do you like how much coffee you drink?
yes. I'm drinking four cups a day.
"all right, all right, all. all right, all right, all. and that's what you think is right?"
"yes. it's the co-workers who work at night. God, they're bringing a bottle."
mm-hmm.
I only have to imagine-
yes.
-what's the body like?
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. what if you-- if you're looking at it, maybe reducing it. maybe it will remove some of the things that are problematic?"
"it's going to be reduced, like. what do you mean?"
the number of the number. just the number.
"well, how much do we talk about it?"
you're telling me. you drink four a day.
mm-hmm.
um--
"you know, because I have to have a morning cup, I really like waking up and-and that's what I'm really looking forward to. you know, the coffee and the coffee."
yes.
-I'm really enjoying the flavors.
yes.
"I definitely don't want to give it up, but."
"I'm sure you have it. all right, all right, all"
uh - - - - - -
so it's important for this one.
mm-hmm.
yes.
"you know, I think it's a good idea to work 12 hours a day, and I think it's a good idea to keep me going until the evening."
yes.
I'd probably be up by noon.
that's great. I'm glad you're here.
"yes, yes, yes, yes."
I'm sure. you have identified the four that might be.
mm-hmm.
-for a minute. what do you think of that?
I'm sure it's okay.
"all right, all right, all"
yes.
"all right, all right, all"
I'd be able to do it.
-- what do you do today?
"I'm fine, thanks."
"all right, all right, all. what's going on since I've seen you?"
"all right, I guess everything's fine. I'm supposed to do something for the community service, or something. I'm not sure."
"all right, all right, all"
I don't know if I'm right.
"she said a little bit about it, but she sounded a little uncertain about the details."
"I know she said I'd be there for hours, but I don't know. I've been listening to it a little bit."
"all right, all right, all. what do you remember about your conversation with your case manager. what's the community service you've done so far?"
except I forgot how many hours or if I should have found it or someone else.
"all right, so, so, so, so. so, you know, it's got to be done."
yes - you've been on probation for the last time.
"yes, I'm sure."
-but you don't have much detail.
"all right, exactly."
"all right, all right, all. well, if you're okay with it, I'll share some of the requirements, maybe a little more."
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes"
"all right, but it's all right?"
mm-hmm.
"all right, so, great. you have to do your community service, so you have to do it by the end of your probation, and your case manager is a great resource to help you find a job. I know some clients have done their community service in the past, or in the community, or in the community, or in the community, or in the community. it's a great place for urban ecology. you're working in the field, you're working with kids. do you think any of those options would be a good fit?"
"yeah, I'm still looking for the hours of the community service?"
so you can work with your case manager.
"all right, all right, all"
"you can ask her or me about it, but they'll be able to tell you what they can do."
"all right, all right, all"
-you can work with places you know.
"all right, all right, all"
"if you want to do it yourself, we can make phone calls together or you can call your case manager."
"all right, so I'd do it. and then how do you do it, 24 hours a weekend?"
I guess it's a lot of time in 24 hours.
[unintelligible 00:02:20]
I'm sure you're really eager to get it done.
"yes, I'm sure."
"-and let it go. I've been helpful to some other clients in the past, so I'll just mark it, okay, I'll do five hours, I'll do three hours, two hours, one hour, one hour, one hour, one hour, one hour,. do you think it might be useful?"
"yeah, I'd like to keep track of him better."
"all right, all right, all"
it's a good idea.
"you know, if you're committed, it's something you can easily do in a week."
"all right, all right, all"
do you have any questions about the community service?
"I'm sure it's true. I'm just worried about who's gonna do it for me, but I guess I have to, I guess, do it myself. I guess I'll be done by then."
"yes, absolutely."
"all right, all right, all"
"you know, if you have any questions, you can always call me or your case manager."
"okay, thanks."
you're welcome. You're welcome.
"all right, so let's go. hello, Ruth, thanks for coming. how's it going?"
"all right, all right, all right,. I'm not even sure why I'm doing it. I'm just a fool. I'm such a fool. I'm not sure what the point is. I've done it over and over, even though I know it's gonna kill me. I'm not gonna have any more willpower, ma'am. yes, it's a foreign language."
"first of all, Ruth, you seem pretty frustrated. you said you were tired. you lost all your strength."
mm-hmm.
you're not going to continue.
"it's just that cutting is the only way out. I'm just thinking of suicide, and I'm very depressed and what's going on in my house."
you feel really good about it.
yes.
yes. you're tired of it. you're stressed out. you're so sad that you can't even feel anything other than what you feel.
"yes, I'm sure. sometimes a pain in the body. it's, uh, to handle and-and the pain."
so you've been in a lot of pain?
"yes, I'm sure. I'm here. I'm here."
"I'm sorry about that. it's very, very frustrating to feel pain and not be able to do anything about it. you can only cry now."
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes"
"all right, Ruth, it's okay. I'm sure you understand. pain in the body."
[foreign language]
"so your mom doesn't understand you, and you don't have a dad?"
"because she's a single mom and she's struggling. I'd like to help her, but I can't. it's sad that it's just sad. she'll be fine if I don't live. she won't have to worry about me or pay."
"you feel like you're tied to your hands, and you feel like you're a burden to your mom. she's a single parent. she's working a lot. you've got all these problems in your life. I think you're just adding more problems to her."
yes.
"if you don't live, it will solve her. she'll do better."
I'm thinking so?
what will it be better for you?
because she won't be a burden.
how do you feel like a burden?
"because I have to pay for food and uniforms, and I have to have a roof."
how do you help her now?
"well, I'm trying to be a good boy. I've been trying to go to school. maybe I don't have the best grades, but I'm not failing any classes."
"all right, all right, all. you know, Ruth, and you're talking to me and opening up and telling me you don't want to go, and you know, you hurt me. that's why you care about it. even more, it's showing that you care about your mom and that, in the end, you don't want to leave her alone because you're still worried about her. it's like you care about her, but right now, it seems like you're thinking of something, but it's not-it's-it's-it's-it-it-it"
it's the right one.
"-what's the right one. you're hurting yourself when you're just your mom. you said she was a single parent. she's not a husband, you don't have a father. it's just two of you. then why should it be the right choice. I understand your pain and I'm sure you're on your way. in the moment, I know that the release you feel physically is helping you. do you want to find something else to replace this behavior?"
"well, I'm not sure. I'm not sure. well, I don't know if I can."
"you don't know if you're right. now you're thinking a lot. you've just opened up to me. you've told me you've cut, you've also thought about hurting yourself, killing yourself. short term, it's helping you. mom's gonna be a burden to you. that's sad for you. we see how much she's struggling, but we see how much you try to help her. we're sure you'll be there. you've been trying to keep up with the grades, even though you've only had A in math, which is the lowest grade you've had all semester. all of this shows how much effort you've put in and we see it. you did what you could and it's normal to feel like it wasn't enough. but that's what we're here for, so you can tell us what we're doing."
"thank you, Mrs. Smith, I'm better."
"thank you, Ruth. thank you for coming."
"all right, all right, all"
"I wanted to talk to you because I saw some pictures of you and some of your friends at the party, and, you know, you're really nice guy. you drink like I'm not drinking. it will destroy your life."
"well, it's just a social gathering. I didn't look for it, uh, the drinks were there and I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I"
"but, Tommy, drinking has a lot of consequences. you don't even have 21, you could be arrested, you could, you know, you could have a bad car accident. you could have ruined your schoolwork. you're going to have a great future. it's really, really important to me."
"I-I-I'm really sorry about what you're saying, but I-I-I really did. I thought I'd control it and I didn't want to go too far. I-I'm not interested in how you say it, um, how do I say it. I wanted to control it and I wanted to make sure my friends were okay, so I didn't drink too much."
"it's not really true that you don't drink too much. you know, anything that's drinking when you're underage is drinking too much. think about what can happen to you."
yes. I'm quite clear what you're talking about. and - - - - - -
how much do you drink?
I don't think I drink much. it's mainly for social occasions. it's not like I'm doing it myself or anything. it's just the.
is it like every weekend?
I'd say it every weekend.
"I'm just so worried, you know, you don't have to worry about anything better?"
I-I guess I'll do it. I'm more productive in school and I'm not going to the party as much as I want to go.
"yes. isn't it a problem for your friends, like maybe you should start with a little more kids in the group and not be with those kids you were partying with?"
"yeah, I guess I'm not really taking it. I'm sure it was forced on them. I just followed them because it seems like they're having a lot of fun. I'd like to make sure I've got everything I can from high school."
"in the moment we know we don't have a good choice, there's a lot of fun, right. it's all about what we're talking about all the time, and it's really good for you to choose what's best for you. you know, I think you should really think about changing things."
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry. yes. I-I-I'm sure I wouldn't be able to drink as much as I'd like to. it's really good sense. I guess I'll try to lower the level of alcohol that I'm drinking."
you should really stop.
"yes. it's everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere,. I'd rather not let it go completely out of my life, but I'd rather understand it and maybe even get used to it. I'm not sure it's going to destroy my life."
"you're wrong about that. I'm really worried about it. well, um, I'd like you to stop. it's better than nothing if you only cut. I appreciate you talking to me, but I'll keep talking to you. it's really important that we do this."
"yes. I-I-I don't see the problem right now, but I'm."
do you want to wait till it's over. do you want to wait for a dramatic moment?
"you're right. You're right. I don't want to be too far away. as I-I'm thinking about something that could happen, I-I'm thinking about something that could happen. I don't really have any real experience with alcohol that much or anyone close to me. I guess it's something I'm supposed to be able to control, but I don't really have much control."
"all right, let's go. Let. maybe we can work together. so, I think we should have a plan that will work for you so you can stop drinking."
yes. I think it would be a good step to-- and a life of maybe being sober and experiencing the real life of life.
"all right, so it seems like it's going"
"all right, all right, all"
"okay, so I'm going to talk to you because we have a zero-tolerance policy for drugs and alcohol at school. I'm responsible for our student athletes and ensuring they comply with the rules as a coach. I heard some of the other kids talking about the party this weekend, and I heard you were there and, you know, I don't know if I'm telling the truth or not. you know, I wanted to talk to you about whether or not you drink and how you feel about it, you know, you can't really do it as a member of our team."
"all right, so let's go. in fact, I'd like to talk about something that happened last weekend. as, you know, I'm, uh, I'm a student of honor. I'm usually studying over the weekend, but my parents don't want me to go to the party, but I'm pretty good at it, so I'm going to go to the party with my friends. when I'm there, it's like I don't know what it is like to be in a party environment where everything is kind of like what happens in the movies."
mm-hmm.
"-or just to get drunk, just for fun. I felt pressure to do what everyone else was doing, and I felt pressure to do what everyone else was doing. I'm not gonna be ostracized."
"yeah, I'm sure. as we were there, we were all there. all right, all right, all. I've been in high school too, you know, I've been drinking. I'm sure. there's not much to do in this town, but, you know, promise we'll have them."
I'm sure you understand.
-you have to stick to the team.
"all right, all right, all. well, I'm sure it's bad for me. it's bad for my body. being a team member is bad for-for-for-for-for. it's gonna be a problem for me. well, I'm not sure. I-I'm being pushed by my friends. I'm not sure. I'd like to go with a different group of friends. maybe. I'm not sure."
"yes. come on, Chris, let's go. you're getting a little pressure from your peers?"
"you feel very much like a team, you have to like it."
"you're a leader, but you're a leader."
"all right, so let's go. as a leader, my fellow teammates expect me to be. I expect them to lead the team in sports and social situations. if it's a social custom, it's a social custom. so it's like."
yes. then you might as well start as a non-drinker.
"I'd be able to, but it could be a mistake. you know, I'm sure I'm going to be mocked for being, you know, a stick in my butt."
"you're a star player, who will be on you?"
I'm just one person against the mob's voice.
"all right, let's go. Let. yeah, I'm sure. so I'm not hearing reports about you drinking. I'm not going to see pictures on Facebook. I have to abide by the rules at school and in my job. you know, I'm saying it, you know-"
I'm sure you understand.
"-I don't mean I know what it's like. I'm sure you're having fun in your teens. I'm sure. you're a star, we're gonna keep you on the team. we have to find a way to deal with it."
"I'll be dedicated to the party and the night. you know, not-not-not a party, but, you know, you're involved in alcohol. and that's what they're doing on the internet."
what's the matter with you?
"like Facebook, all the pictures you've seen on the internet. as I'm going to a party where I'm supposed to drink alcohol and I'm supposed to be able to do it in my own time, I'm going to avoid those situations where I'm supposed to go to a party where I'm supposed to drink"
"all right, let's go. Let. yes. if you're going to be a team, we have to have a deal. all right?"
"all right, so let's go. I'm stopping. I'm stopping."
"all right, let's go. Let. you're gonna promise me?"
"I'm telling you, I promise."
"all right, let's go. Let. shake. Shake. Shake"
shake. Shake. Shake
"all right, let's go. Let. I'll see you later."
you'll see me later.
"all right, let's go. Let"
"hello, Laura. Hi, Laura. Hi. thank you for coming. I don't know what you know about why you're here or what we should talk about. in fact, I'll meet all the students in the school for a semester or two. we'll talk about what's going on in your life. I'll ask you about your goals and what you like to do for fun. we'll talk about different behaviors and things like that. it's pretty casual, it's a little informal, just a chance to meet you."
"all right, all right, all"
"all right, all right, all. so tell me a little bit about yourself."
"all right, all right, all. I'm Laura and I'm 17."
"all right, all right, all. what do you like to do for fun?"
"mostly, I'm just hanging out with my friends."
"when you're with your friends, what do you do. you're going to the football game, you're going to the party?"
"if it's a school thing, maybe like a game or two, or maybe at the mall, like, to shop or go to the cinema or something, and at night, maybe like a party or something."
"all right, all right, all. what hobbies do you have?"
"I like to read, I like to go out and, like, walk around and, like, go out and. I'm very outdoorsy, so I'm very outdoorsy."
"all right, all right, all right,. what do you plan to do after high school?"
"I'm planning on going to college and maybe, you know, I'll have a good career."
that's great. It's great. what do you think you're gonna study?
"I'm looking at the newspaper, maybe before the law."
"all right, so, so, so,"
"it's a little different, but it's okay."
"yes, that's great. that's a great goal."
yes. thank you.
"getting into law school is, uh, hard work. do you have a good school. what's the grade you got?"
"yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine. I only got A and B, so I'm fine."
"all right, all right, all. what's not going to be A and B?"
"well, I'm A, B, and A, so, yeah."
"all right, all right, all. and where do you want to go to school?"
"I don't know, but I'm thinking of schools like this, so maybe I'll go."
"all right, all right, all. all right, let's go. what's the reason you decided to go to law school or-or journalism?"
"I started looking at careers that might be a little bit of a science or math, so I started looking at them. so-so-so-so"
"all right, all right, all. all right, so let's get. you seem to have a good goal and you work hard in school. you've said you like to go out with your friends, so you're going to go shopping, so you drink alcohol?"
"well, no, no, no, no,. maybe a couple of drinks at the party."
"all right, all right, all. how often do you drink?"
at least once a month.
you drink alcohol once or twice a month?
yes.
"all right, so maybe 20 times a year."
"maybe, maybe."
so you drink a lot?
"yeah, I'd say that."
"all right, all right, all. what have you ever had the most?"
"well, at the party, we only have two drinks. I'm not. I'm not drinking much. I'm not interested in getting drunk. so, I'm just holding a drink, so my friends won't be bothering me. it's like I'm actually doing something. I'm not drinking much, but I'm not drinking much. so-so-so-so"
but you drank before?
"no, not really, but I'm not drunk."
"all right, all right, all. you've never had two drinks in a day."
yes.
"all right, all right, all. it's interesting. It's a little. so, what about the bad stuff about alcohol?"
"yeah, yeah, yeah."
"all right, all right, all. drinking and driving are really important to teenagers. well, actually, it's a big problem. every year, there's a kid dying in a car accident. you have to make sure you don't do it, okay. did you ever do it. you've ever been in the car."
"no, I've never been in a car with a drunk driver."
"all right, all right, all. how much do you drink with your friends?"
"I know there's a lot of people who drink more than I do, but I know there's a lot of people who drink a lot more."
"all right, all right, all. do you have any other kids at these parties?"
"yes. I drink more than the kids. of course, of course."
and you're hanging out with them?
"not really, like, I know who they are and I'll tell you, but not really."
"you know, it's actually more dangerous to hang around kids who drink a lot. you know, I've been thinking about it a"
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. that's true. It's a good thing"
"you know, so, you know, there's a lot of other dangers of drinking, like, um, you know, people, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,"
yes.
"you know, especially if you drink, you're more likely to be attacked by a guy who can take advantage of you. did you think about it?"
"yeah, yeah, I've done it. that's why I'm not drinking much."
mm-hmm.
so-so-so-so
"when they drink, people tend to fight more. well, even at school, there were plenty of kids who got in trouble, even if they drank and they took pictures of them on Facebook."
yes.
"and then they find out or the school finds out and, you know, we have a zero tolerance policy about drugs and alcohol, and we're really serious about it. do you think about it?"
"yes. of course, of course."
but you still drink.
"yeah, I guess it's a party thing, so-"
"uh-huh. so, if you want to be a lawyer, what do you think is the thing?"
"of course, not. that's why I'm not so much interested in drinking. just-just-just-just"
mm-hmm.
-I'm gonna try to look like that.
"mm-hmm. all right, all right, all. well, I'm thinking of something. then we should talk about what we want to achieve-"
"all right, all right, all"
-it's safer.
"all right, all right, all"
"of course, you shouldn't drink. what do you think about this?"
"I'm sure. I'm sure. I'm sure there are other risks involved in alcohol, like, health and so on, so I'm sure alcohol isn't the best thing."
"mm-hmm. so, you're thinking about quitting?"
"well, it's not really important to me, so."
"all right, all right, all. so, I'll write it down so you know you're not going to quit."
"all right, all right, all"
"well, that's what we're here for, and that's great, so we're here to talk about it and-and make sure you come to that decision. so, I guess, you're gonna quit this weekend?"
"of course, of course, of course. I'm not gonna have a drink."
"all right, and what about your friends who drink?"
"I can't control what they're doing, but I'm sure I'll try to keep my closest friends from doing it."
"all right, and what if they don't?"
then I guess I'll try to stay out of it. I'm trying to find something that doesn't involve alcohol.
yes. you should probably find a new friend if your friends don't stop drinking.
"all right, all right, all"
"you know, if they drink, they pressure you to drink and then you feel awkward and you know, you're gonna be stuck and-and you don't know what to do and you don't know what to do and you don't know what to. if they're the kind of people who drink-"
yes.
-they probably don't have much influence.
"all right, all right, all right,"
"you know, now you're going to college, and it's going to be a lot harder, and, you know, if you want to go to college, it's going to be a lot harder."
"all right, I'm sure."
"all right, so, um, that's great because it's pretty much what I've been thinking about. well, let's see. Let's see. I guess we didn't talk about what happens when your parents find out you drink."
they'd be pretty pissed off. yes. they're not really against alcohol.
mm-hmm.
so-so-so-so
"all right, so, you know, just another reason why you should probably stop. all right, all right, all right, all right. okay, so, like I said, I'll probably be right down there, so, uh, you know, I'll probably meet you again, so we can, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,"
"all right, all right, all"
"you don't drink, you don't hang out with anyone who drinks. do you want to talk about something else?"
"no, no, no. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good"
"all right, all right, all. um, anything you want to ask me-"
"no, no, no, no, no"
-like that?
I'm not asking questions.
"all right, all right, all. are you sure. all right, all right, all. all right, let's go. Let. well, that's probably what it is. you're going to school, and thanks for coming."
"all right, thanks."
"hello, Andrea. Hi, Andrea. thank you for coming. I'm just here to meet all the students, so I'm not really sure what you're telling me. I'm usually in meetings with you twice a semester. I'll talk about your life and your goals and some of the things you might want to do and just the things you might want to do."
"all right, all right, all"
so tell me a little about yourself.
"well, I'm Andrea, you know, I'm in the marching band. I'm playing the tenor sax."
"oh, my God."
"yes. I'm involved in music. well, I'm also a jazz band, a wind ensemble, and."
"all right, all right, all"
I'm a student at IB.
"all right, all right, all. how long have you been playing the saxophone?"
"all right, so the saxophone. I've been involved in music for about 10 years, so I've been involved in music for a long time."
"wow, that's really cool. it's been a long time. what other instruments are you using?"
I've been playing the violin for the first time.
"no kidding, I'm serious."
"I've been playing it for six years, I've been playing it for a clarinet, I've been playing it. then I've found the one I like."
that's great. It's great. It. you're playing tenors?
"yes, the tenor sax."
"wow, that's really cool. how long have you been in the marching band?"
"since freshman year, we've been marching. it's been three years since I've been."
"all right, all right, all. a couple of years ago. all right, so let's get. how about the marching band?"
"it's fun, it's fun, it. it's a lot of work, long hours, but it's fun."
what's your favorite part of the show?
I really like the group's setting.
"all right, all right, all right,"
"you know, I've been working with my classmates. and the whole show is going to be."
uh-huh.
"-once you're in the competition, it's very exciting."
"all right, all right, all"
it's really nice. It's really nice.
"all right, let's go. and you're in a band with a lot of friends."
yes.
-friends from the band or the band?
I've got two-two groups. I'm friends from school and then my friends from the band.
"all right, all right, all"
"so, so, so, so"
"all right, so let's get. so, um, tell me a little bit about your family?"
"he's older than me, nine years older."
"wow, that's really cool."
my parents and my dog. [laughing]
"all right, all right, all. what kind of dog do you have?"
he's a golden retriever.
"all right, so, so, so,"
"Charlie, I'm sorry. I"
"Charlie, I'm sorry. I"
he's a big boy. yes.
"oh, my God, it's cute. did you ever have him?"
yes. he's been eight years old.
"oh, my God. yes. all right, all right, all. it's really nice. It's really. what do you plan to do after high school?"
"well, I'm planning on going to school. I want to be a doctor someday."
"wow, that's really cool."
"I'm interested in psychology, psychiatry, something like that."
you have big dreams.
yes.
"all right, let's go. all right, let's go. Let. do you think about school or college. you think of psychology as a major."
"I didn't really think about which school, I-"
"all right, so let's go"
"everyone wants to go to the Ivy League, so they're all laughing."
"all right, let's go. Let. how about your grades?"
"well, they're pretty good, you know, high three-point."
"all right, all right, all. all right, all right, all. well, I'm glad you're here. all right, let's go. Let. what do you do for fun on the weekend?"
I'm usually with my friends. we go to the cinema or we'll probably meet someone.
mm-hmm.
-and just stay here and be quiet.
"mm-hmm. when you're out, you're supposed to have a drink?"
sometimes I'll be honest with you.
how much do you drink alcohol?
"it's like every weekend or three weekends out of the month, or something like that."
so you drink a lot?
"a little bit, yeah."
"all right, all right, all. how much do you drink on the day you drink?"
"we don't drink, we don't drink. it's more like a little drunk."
mm-hmm.
I've been drunk before.
mm-hmm.
"-but I've learned my lesson, I'm not happy about it."
I have it. you drank a lot of alcohol. what's the most you've ever had?
as many drinks as you want?
yes.
"well, it's a lot of money. I drank it for the first time, and it was like three or four cups, but it was a mixture of different things."
"all right, so you're not even aware."
"so, I'm not-- Yeah."
"all right, all right, all. so you're drinking with your friends?"
"yes. yes, I'm sure. not all of them, but some of them."
"all right, all right, all. how much do they drink?"
"it's a little more or less. we'll probably only have a couple of cups, but sometimes a little bit, but they can be pretty heavy."
"all right, so it's a cup, but it's not a drink."
"it's a red, you know, typical. yes."
it's got a lot of alcohol.
mm-hmm.
"all right, all right, all. oh, my God, you drink a lot. you're in a high-risk group because of your drinking."
mm-hmm.
"so, is it a surprise to you?"
a little bit.
"yes. well, we're calling it a high-risk because it means that there's a lot of risk that you might have a bad consequence to drinking. you know, it's like, uh, car accidents, or other accidents, or, you know, sexual assault, or, you know, health problems, or, you know, alcoholism. do you think about what you've done?"
"not too much, really. I've always thought since you're in my group-"
uh-huh.
"we usually sleep together, we don't drink or drive, and we're not going to be raped or anything like that."
uh-huh.
but I'm not thinking about alcoholism.
"all right, all right, all. you drink a lot, but you drink a lot. well, yes, and yes. all right, all right, all. so, let's talk about how you might be able to change it. you really have to stop drinking like that."
"all right, all right, all"
"so, um, you're thinking about stopping drinking?"
"yeah, I'd say so. I'm not gonna need him. for instance, it's used as a kind of, like, let's get the party going."
uh-huh.
but we've always had it-
uh-huh.
"-of course. so, I guess it's possible to stop drinking."
"all right, all right, all. so you're not gonna drink anymore?"
"I'd probably start with, ""Hey, guys, I'm not going to drink today."""
uh-huh.
and I'm gonna see how it goes. because - because - because - because
"all right, all right, all. you're not very much like you think it's going to work."
"yes. control my drink, and it's another thing when everyone else is drinking."
mm-hmm.
"-of, ""Oh, they think I'm stupid."""
"all right, all right, all. how do you get rid of your friends without thinking you're stupid?"
yes.
"all right, all right, all. if they're your friends, do you think they're really good friends?"
"I know they wouldn't have a problem with my closest. but I don't know anyone close to me, but I'd like to hang out with them."
uh-huh.
-I'm sure they'll ostracize me for something.
but you might be better off without them. they're-they're-they're-they
yes.
- Not very good friends.
maybe too much of a judge.
"mm-hmm. so, um, so I'd like to set a goal that you stop drinking."
"all right, all right, all"
"as soon as possible, like this weekend."
"all right, all right, all"
"well, you know, we're going to set you a goal, and then we'll talk about it, and then we'll see if you're really going to stop. well, what do you think about that?"
"well, I think there's a possibility."
"all right, all right, all. so-so-so-so"
"I think if you have a good plan, I'll be able to follow it."
"all right, so, great. so, you're gonna quit, and, uh, the friends you've got who don't think you're supportive, you're just gonna, I guess, not be around."
yes. I'm sure I can handle it.
"all right, all right, all. so, um, you're friends with your band?"
"well, not really. the ones who drink more are my friends. my friends, we're focused on the band."
uh-huh.
I'm not really. -I'm not really. -
"all right, all right, all. well, that's good, really just to focus more on the band. if you want to go to medical school, you won't be able to go to medical school if you drink like that."
yes.
"it's going to be really hard for college. you can't drink so much with all those pre-med classes. you've thought about it, haven't you?"
"not too much, really."
"yes. all right, all right, all. then you'll be able to help you with the goal of stopping drinking. well, it's not really hard, really, especially if you don't want to be around."
mm-hmm.
"-people who drink a lot, um, because you're friends. yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. so, what do you want to ask me?"
"well, what do you say-- uh, yes, I'm doing it. so what do I say, ""Hey, why don't you drink?"""
mm-hmm.
how do I handle this situation?
"you know, it would be a good option to just review with them all the bad things about alcohol. ""I've thought about it, and I've realized it's going to be a problem for me. ""my health is very much at risk."". ""I'm not interested in becoming a drinker."". ""I'm not interested in liver disease. ""I'm not going to be drunk or in an accident."""
mm-hmm.
"-or to fight. "". ""I heard a lot of stories about kids who were drunk and they acted like idiots, and then people posted pictures on Instagram."""
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
it's just their social life. it's like we've been over.
yes.
so - so - so - so
"and-and you know, like a professional life."
mm-hmm.
I'm not gonna bite you in the butt.
"yes. you know, I think you should tell your friends you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know"
"all right, all right, all"
then-and-then-and-
I'm sure I can handle it.
-you'd like to tell them to stop. then it would be good. you would have been a good friend.
as a group we-we all work together to improve.
"yes. yes. it's exactly. It's exactly. all right, let's go. Let. can I help you with anything else?"
"no, no, no, no. I think I'm fine."
"all right, all right, all. in a couple of weeks, I'll be planning another meeting."
"all right, all right, all"
you have to really stop drinking.
"all right, all right, all"
"all right, let's go. Let"
"all right, let's go. Let"
"all right, so let's get"
I'm wondering if you've been injured yesterday and I'm wondering if you can tell me a little about what happened?
"it's really silly, but it's true. last night, I was at a pub crawl. I thought it was a good idea to meet my friends who were, yeah, they're in front of me. I'm wearing these like stilts 'cause it's a 90s-themed pub crawl. well, then I'm just going to fall on my ankle. it's really embarrassing for me."
it seems like a wild night.
yes.
yes.
"after that, it was a lot of fun, but I didn't dance."
"no, I guess it's over with your shaking and moving. I'm wondering if you'd be open to exploring the use of alcohol and what it looks like in the week."
"as long as we don't talk too much about vodka, I'm fine."
you still feel the effects of-
yes.
-you were here last night?
a little bit.
"wow, it's-"
yes.
-it's a tough night.
"all right, it's normal."
what's your typical week of alcohol consumption?
"well, you know, we're all college students, so it's just normal to have a little drink."
you don't have any new drinks?
"no, no, no, no"
what's the look of a couple of drinks. does it mean every night. is there a second drink?
"um, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,. I'm probably drinking seven or eight drinks. well, you know, maybe when I'm at school, a long day at the library, maybe a beer or two."
"all right, let's go. Let. do you have any concerns about alcohol consumption?"
"no, no, no, no. I don't know. I'm not sure. I feel like college students."
"all right, so you don't mind if the other students are doing it, right?"
yes.
would you like to look at the guidelines for low-risk alcohol?
sure.
I'm wondering if we can take a quick look at this-
yes.
"-and women have a week of about two drinks, uh, per day, and they're about ten drinks."
really?
yes.
"wow, that's really cool."
where do you think you're going to go?
"well, I'd say a little over it."
"all right, all right, all right,"
especially when the election is coming.
"all right, so you can deal with stress?"
yes.
"you know, it's something that's been a way of coping for a while?"
"yes. yeah, I'd say so."
"all right, all right, all. do you care about this?"
"well, I mean, it seems like a little bit of a lot, uh, for me and my tolerance."
mm-hmm.
"over the years, I've built it up."
"all right, all right, all"
"well, I guess it's a little worrying to me."
do you have any reasons to reduce the use of alcohol?
"well, uh, is there any reason to. well, I guess it's a health issue."
tell me more about it.
"of course, I'm not feeling very well right now. I'm definitely more productive when I don't have a hangover. well, I'm seeing a benefit."
so you'll see some benefits to reduce the amount of alcohol.
yes.
"-um, you're gonna eat it for the week?"
"yes, yes, yes,"
"maybe when you feel better, you'd like to take a little more time to explore this with me. do you want to talk to me about this?"
"yeah, yeah, I'm thinking of it when I'm a little better. maybe when I'm not so tired and I'm not injured."
"if you're interested, I'd like to set up a meeting with you next week or next week."
"all right, all right, all right,"
-maybe a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a. is there anything we can do about it?
"sure. on a Saturday morning, not on the morning. [chuckles]"
it's okay with me.
"all right, all right, all"
thank you. Thank you. Thank you
yes. it's going to be good.
"I'll tell you what I normally do in this interview, and we'll talk about it for maybe 20 minutes. I usually just give you feedback from the questionnaire you answered last week."
mm-hmm.
"-and then we're just talking about it. well, but I like to start with where you want to go."
"you know, it was weird, you know, when I was doing the questionnaire, I mean, I guess I don't really think about it."
mm-hmm.
-I've been thinking about how much I drink.
mm-hmm.
"um, you know, it's like, you know, I drink a lot, you know, like, uh, you know, you know, you know, you know, you"
"well, I'm thinking of something like"
"it's a little, kind of, a lot, I mean, it's, kind of, a lot, I mean, it's, kind of, a lot."
you've been pretty surprised by what you've learned about your patterns.
"well, I drank, like, as much as my friends drank, and then, like, I was talking to my roommate."
"well, I'm thinking of something like"
"-Saturday, Sunday, Sunday."
mm-hmm.
"""Sarah, it's crazy,"" she said. where do you drink? '. ""well, you know, like, different places."". like, I guess, like, I don't know, my friends didn't. well, I don't know, but it's, yeah, I'm not sure"
"she was surprised to know that you drank as much as you did, and she was surprised to know that you drank as much as you did."
"yeah, I guess it's just like, you know, everyone was doing it, you know-"
mm-hmm.
-but it wasn't really what happened. [chuckles]
"you didn't think about it before, but the fact that you drink is clearly not something you've ever thought about?"
yes.
mm-hmm.
"yes, it was the most weird thing to do."
"all right, all right, all"
-the form.
"hello, Laura. Hi, Laura. Hi"
hello. Hi. Hi. Hi
"thank you for coming. well, I don't know how much you know about what you're doing here. if it's okay, I'll tell you a little bit."
yes.
"well, basically, we're here, I'm just gonna talk to you about what you want to do with your life, um, and talk about some of the things you might want to do differently. you know, I don't have to judge you or try to change you. I'll talk about how things are going, what you might want to change your life, and what I can help you with that."
"all right, all right, all"
"all right, so it sounds good?"
yes.
"okay, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so,"
"well, I'm Laura. I'm 17, and I'm a senior in high school."
"all right, all right, all. what do you plan to do with your life?"
"you know, you're going to college, you know, you're going to college."
"well, I'm thinking of something like"
yes.
that's great. It's great.
yes.
do you have a plan for where you're going?
"I don't know yet. maybe a couple of schools in the area, I'd like to apply."
"oh, my God."
maybe you should go to college.
"all right, let's go."
yes.
"so, you're kind of open to the possibility."
"of course, of course."
"all right, so let's get. and, what do you think you might want to study?"
"yes, maybe, before the law."
"wow, that's really cool. all right, that's great."
yes.
"all right, okay, all right, all right. what's your favorite thing to do?"
"I like to go out with my friends, maybe go to a party, or go to the mall, or if there's a school event, we'll go to the game."
mm-hmm.
"-something like that, yes."
do you like to have a good time?
yes.
you're a lot of friends or a couple of friends?
"I'd say a little bit of a moderate amount. I don't really like it, I don't have any friends."
mm-hmm.
"so, I'm like the usual."
"all right, let's go. Let"
yes.
"it's a good way to be, right?"
yes. [chuckles]
"all right, so, um, it seems like, in general, you're doing pretty well. how do you feel about your grades?"
"well, they're good, as well as Bs. so, I'm fine. I'm fine."
"all right, all right, all"
"through college, I've been through it"
"all right, so let's get. I'd like to ask you something, you know, people have different values or things that are important to them. maybe they're really close to family or really important to them. I'll show you a couple of things on this sheet, and if you can see them all. so, there's a lot of things like belonging, community, culture, religion, respect, self-determination and self-sufficiency. what do you think is important to you?"
"family definitely, uh, friendship, and belonging."
"all right, all right, all"
yes.
what's important to your family?
"I-I love them, so I'm thinking of them-"
"well, I'm thinking of something like"
-and I'm hoping they'll accept me and love me.
"all right, all right, all. do you have a brother or sister?"
"yes, I'm a sister."
"all right, so, great. and how about friendship?"
I've met many people I care about. so I'd like them to accept me.
"all right, so let's get. so, being a friend and-"
yes.
-it's important to have friends who are good friends. then what about the fact that you belong. you've also mentioned it.
"yes, just a sense of what it is to be accepted and not."
"well, I'm thinking of something like"
"-in general, yes."
yes. I want to be part of the group.
yes.
"-and I guess it's a little bit. all right, so, great. well, you know, I'd like to talk about something like that, you know, you mentioned you wanted to go out with friends and. and, when you're at the party, do you ever drink?"
"well, maybe a little bit of a drink, maybe a little bit."
"all right, all right, all. how does alcohol fit into the social scene?"
"well, I'm just drinking to look like I drank, even though I don't."
"well, I'm thinking of something like"
maybe people won't be interested in drinking.
"all right, you feel a little pressure from the other people who drink, and it's easier for you."
"yes, just-"
-I'd like a little drink.
-to have it and pretend to have it.
"all right, all right, all"
yes.
"and, um, is it more or less often. how- How- How- How"
"well, uh, uh, uh"
-you're often thinking about alcohol.
maybe a couple of weekends a month?
"all right, all right, all"
it wasn't much.
you have a problem with alcohol for a month or two?
yes.
"all right, all right, all. what kind of situation do you have?"
someone's got a house at the party.
uh-huh.
"maybe even if it wasn't a party, like a small social gathering, maybe there would be a couple of beers."
"well, I'm thinking of something like"
-or something.
"well, mostly just hanging out with my friends."
"pretty much, yeah."
you've ever been to places where there's a parent.
um - - - - - -
-or mostly with the kids?
"I'm mostly just with us, but sometimes I'm with a friend and I'm like I'm a family. so, we'll all be quiet."
mm-hmm. and what about driving?
"um, like driving drunk?"
"yes. after you drink, you go somewhere in the car?"
"of course, not. I didn't drink, I didn't drive, and I didn't drink."
"all right, all right, all. you made a decision about that. it seems like you're."
"yes, because I'm sure it's dangerous."
"all right, all right, all. what do you know about the danger?"
"alcohol definitely affects your judgment. I mean, it can lead to accidents and things like that, so I don't want to be in that situation."
you really try to be safe and-and-
yes.
you don't want to put yourself in-
"of course, of course."
"- In these situations. that's great. It's great. it's hard, and I'm really glad you can handle it."
thank you. Thank you. Thank you
you've said you'd like to have a drink or two. what's the most alcohol you've ever had?
no more than two drinks.
"all right, all right, all. so, the most-so, the most-so, the"
yes.
"-two? - two? - two. all right, all right, all. and what do you like about alcohol?"
"I didn't drink much, but I've never been drunk."
uh-huh.
"you know, I don't really know if I like it or not, but it's just like. I mean, you're in a good mood."
mm-hmm.
"so, so, so, so"
so you're relaxed or something?
"yes, yes, I'm fine."
"all right, all right, all. uh, what about something else?"
"no, no, no, no, no, no,. as I've said, I'm not drinking much."
mm-hmm.
"so, I-I'm not gonna tell you."
"all right, all right, all. and, not so much about alcohol?"
"of course, of course, of course. well, when I'm at the party, they drink too much, they start to drink, or they get drunk, or they're really loud and obnoxious, or they're really loud and obnoxious."
mm-hmm. you saw a lot of kids who-
yes.
-there were consequences - there were consequences - there
yes.
-and you decided it wasn't for you?
yes.
"I have it. I-I'm sure. [chuckles] Uh, what else do you think you could do?"
"no, I mean, I never, you know, I never had a friend who was in a serious accident. it's just a little bit of a thing"
mm-hmm.
"-really, it's a lot of things."
"all right, all right, all. it's something that's not legal, but it's something that's not legal for someone who hasn't been 21."
yes.
"-and it's something that's considered very risky. so, I'm wondering what you think about it, just as a matter of how it's going to fit in your life."
"I'm sure it's risky, but I guess we're still doing it. [chuckles]"
"uh-huh. you know, it's something that's."
"it's just there, just like that."
"is it just here. all right, all right, all. you mentioned your friends and your family, and I'm wondering if you're interested in them. how does alcohol affect it?"
"well, I'm not in my family life, because my parents don't really approve of it."
"all right, all right, all"
"-alcohol, but, I mean, when I'm with my friends, or we're at a party, there's usually alcohol involved."
"all right, all right, all. so, from your family's perspective, it's not a good thing to drink?"
yes.
"you're more likely to have fun with friends, or maybe you'd have a little more fun, or maybe you'd be a little more fun, or maybe you'd be a little more fun?"
since it's just there.
"all right, all right, all"
so-so-so-so
I have it.
-it's connected to the whole thing.
"all right, all right, all. how do you think drinking will fit in with your life in five, ten, or fifteen years?"
"if any of it plays a role, it's probably a little bit of a role."
mm-hmm.
"-in my life, I've had big plans for the future. so, so, so, so"
"all right, all right, all. do you want to talk about it a little more. what's the matter with you?"
"if I study, or in college, or in law school, or in law school, I don't think I'd drink as much or go to the party."
"all right, so, the alcohol is something that's going to make it harder to achieve your goals?"
"of course, of course."
"when you're looking ahead, how often do you think you're going to drink?"
"maybe I'm less than I used to be. I'm not drinking much, so I'm not drinking."
mm-hmm.
"-maybe, like, one drink every night."
"all right, all right, all. so, you're kind of planning to cut back."
"of course, of course."
-you're going to drink?
of course.
what if it goes?
"I guess I'd like to go to high school, but I guess I'd like to go to college, but I guess not so much."
"you don't have to make any major changes, but you feel like you could make some changes that would make it easier or -"
"of course, of course. that's a good word."
"all right, all right, all. how important is it to change your drinking, on a scale of 1 to 10. if you don't care about 1, you don't think about it, and 10 is the most important thing."
maybe five or six.
why don't you say five or six?
"well, I don't care about it, but I don't want to change anything about myself."
"all right, all right, all. you've thought about it or something."
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. of course."
"all right, all right, all. and, how confident are you that you'll change your mind if you decide to change your mind?"
"well, I'm pretty confident I can handle it if I don't drink."
mm-hmm.
"I don't really like the whole scene, so I don't think it's going to be difficult."
"so, what number would you say?"
on a scale of 1 to 10
mm-hmm.
-if I'm not going to quit?
yes.
maybe it's eight or nine.
"all right, and why do you say 8 or 9?"
"because, as I said, it's not a big part of my life. it's not really hard to do this."
"all right, all right, all. all right, let's go. Let. well, at some point, you might have a vague plan to change your drinking."
"yes, I'm sure."
"-and, it's important to you. you want to do it because you have a big goal, and you feel very confident that you can achieve it. what would you like to set for today?"
"I guess I'll stop, maybe next time I'm at a party."
"all right, all right, all. you're pretty confident you'll stop?"
yes. I'm telling my friends-- My dad-- My friends don't really pressure me.
uh-huh.
I don't know much about people who don't know me.
"all right, all right, all"
"""I'm not interested in a drink today,"" I'd say."
what are some of the benefits of the goal?
I'll definitely have all my senses and I'll be able to see everything.
uh-huh. any other things?
I guess it's a health issue. alcohol is bad for your health.
mm-hmm.
"so, that's what it would be."
"all right, all right, all. so, you're really comfortable with the idea of not drinking anymore. and then I see how it goes."
yes.
"all right, all right, all. would it be okay if we met again and-and-and-and see if it's going to work out?"
"sure, that's okay."
"all right, so, great. well, I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I"
yes.
"-to achieve your academic and career goals, and just not having to deal with the consequences of your peers."
"all right, so let's go"
"all right, all right, all. all right, so, very good. do you think I should know something else?"
how do you advise me to stop drinking?
"that's a great question. it's harder if your friends drink, and it's easier to try to have more activities that don't involve alcohol, but-"
"all right, all right, all right,"
"-of course, if you don't plan it. I'd recommend some of the things you can do if you're at a party, um, and there's alcohol, and there's other kids you might not be friends with, um, some of the things I'd recommend. if people have a mixed drink, you know, just having a coke, you know, if they have a beer, you know, just having a coke."
"all right, all right, all right"
"-without any alcohol. people who offer you alcohol often have something in their hands, so they can't help you, because you have something in your hand."
"yes, that's a good idea."
"-and it's a little, uh, it's a little, uh, it's a little, uh, it's. do you think you might be able to do something like that?"
"of course, I'm sure."
"all right, all right, all. what about talking to your friends about it, and what do you think about how you might approach it, or what else you'd like to tell them?"
"I mean, I'm thinking of it"
-to stop drinking.
I only wanted to tell them I didn't want to drink anymore. it wasn't me.
uh-huh.
"so, so, so, so"
would your friends be okay with it?
"yes. for sure, my closest friends."
"all right, so, great. any other questions or concerns. do you want me to help you with anything else?"
"no, no, no, no. no, I'm fine. I'm fine."
"all right, all right, all. so, um, I guess we'll see if we can meet in a couple of weeks and see what it's going to be."
"all right, all right, all"
"-and then, if things go well, then great, and if you have any problems, we can solve them together."
"all right, so, great. thank you."
"all right, so the sound is okay?"
yes.
"all right, let's go. Let. thank you very much."
it's not a problem. It's
"thank you, Katie. I'm looking forward to meeting you, and maybe just want to start with a little bit of what you've done today?"
"sure, I'm sure. well, I'm supposed to see you, my doctor. well, I guess he's worried about my pregnancy and my baby. well, I'm doing what I'm told."
you mentioned he had some concerns about meeting with you today. do you have a little bit of information?
"well, he's concerned about my alcohol consumption."
"all right, all right, all. I wonder if you're worried about it."
"no, no, no, no, no"
"no, no, no, no. all right, all right, all. so that's not a problem for you. at this point, it's not for you."
mm-hmm.
"all right, all right, all. so what about sharing a little bit of what you drink and what you're thinking about today?"
"all right, all right, all right,. well, I'm going to go out with my friends, and I drink like a glass of wine, and I'm just, you know, to relax. with dinner, wine was a family tradition. so-so-so-so"
"all right, all right, all"
yes.
"you know, it's a little bit of your culture, and you know, you might have taken a little bit of a drink, maybe a little bit of a drink."
"I-I know, I-I've seen articles on Facebook and-and, you know, I see things like that, you know, I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-. I'm independent and I'm going to do what I want."
"all right, all right, all. you're not comfortable with someone telling you what you should be eating, how much alcohol, and how much alcohol you should be drinking. your doctor said you shouldn't drink too much alcohol, and asked you to come see me. you've also been looking a little bit at things."
"yes. you know, I looked at it, you know, and I thought, you know, what I'd say to support my argument."
"all right, all right, all"
"yeah, and I'm gonna do what I want, and I'm gonna do what I want. so it's- Yes. I'm here, but I'm not sure. so-so-so-so"
you know what you want to be and you want to be the boss of your body and you don't want anyone else telling you what's okay and what's not okay. you don't seem to be too concerned about substance use.
"no, no, no, no,. I've never been like that."
"all right, all right, all. I wonder if it's coming from, ""It's okay."". I have a message from my friends."
"yes, I'm sure."
"""well, the media said it was okay to drink alcohol. well, I'm just, I don't have it, and maybe the doctor's wrong. """
mm-hmm. I'm sure.
you don't know if he's playing it a little bit?
"yes. you know, I'm thinking of you-"
maybe a little extreme.
yes.
"-to stop drinking. um, I just wonder, would you like to see what Canada's guidelines say about drinking. you'd be open to that?"
"as far as I'm concerned, right now"
yes.
uh-uh-uh-uh
what if I show you a brochure?
"yeah, I guess."
yeah?
sure.
"well, if we look at the guidelines for women, it says there are safe limits of 10 drinks a week and 2 drinks a day. and that's when a woman doesn't have a baby. there's no safe amount of alcohol in pregnancy, as far as drinking. well, really, she shouldn't drink any alcohol. and I'm wondering what you think about it?"
"I know, I've heard of it, but I don't see the evidence. if someone can prove to me that they like me, or show a direct link, or something like that, I don't see the risk."
"you don't know if it's enough, you know, if you see it in black and white."
it's the same thing.
-to convince you that it's dangerous to drink alcohol?
yes. it's just a nice little brochure that says what I know.
"it's kind of like, um, the doctor's saying something and it's kind of like, uh, it's kind of a little bit of a blow."
mm-hmm.
"you have a lot of information about alcohol, which is safe to drink during pregnancy. tell me about the information you've done."
"well, I looked at different things. I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I. so that's the extent."
"mm-hmm. you've mentioned you've looked at some articles and you think they're important. so, um, is that something new. well, you'll tell me about it."
I'm not really interested in- I don't really like- I'm not interested in anything.
mm-hmm.
I'm not really sure when they were published. I only found things that support my way of thinking.
"you felt like, um, the information you found supports the values you have about being independent and autonomous, and the information you've heard or talked to you about, and then you feel like you have a choice and the information you've heard or talked to"
"yes. it's like the same thing I heard, that the limits and the amount of alcohol are the same, but it's like, why not?"
mm-hmm.
"it's like the ""why"" that it's like-"
mm-hmm.
-I'm not getting any information about this.
what's the big deal if you drink?
"if there were any problems, what would it be?"
"maybe we'll put it on the shelf for a minute, and we'll see what the guidelines are saying, and then we'll see what they're saying. and, um, and-and I wonder if you'd like to look at your pregnancy, and you were hoping to have a baby?"
yes.
you were planning something like that?
"yes, I'm sure."
"all right, all right, all. and I wonder, you know, how important is it to have a healthy baby for you?"
"well, it's really important to me. I'm really interested in having a healthy baby and raising him or her well and being a good parent."
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry. what's the best parent look like. tell me more about it."
"I don't want to be there, not being there, not being absent, not being able to take care of them, not being happy about it. well, you know, the basics."
"well, I'm thinking of something. kind of like protecting your baby."
yes.
-to guide your baby and-
mm-hmm.
-you're really important to the baby-
yes.
-and you're raising your baby well?
of course.
"I hear you say that, you know, protecting your baby is important to you and at the same time, um, it's kind of a contradiction."
mm-hmm.
what do you think about this?
"well, I don't know- I don't know where-where the information is or anything about it, like, where's the hard evidence."
you want to see it in black and white.
yes.
"you want to know it's the best thing in the world. I've been sharing this information with you, this is the latest information-based, uh, since 2011, and, uh, a lot of research has been done, what is-what. you choose what's best for you and what's best for your baby. what do you think about what?"
"well, I'm surprised that this is based on research from 2011, um, and I'm sure I missed it. if it's true, I'd like to do what's best for my baby and myself. I guess, uh, I'll have to, uh, I guess, but, uh, that's a lot of information to take in today."
"you know, it seems like you made a really good decision about your baby. you've done research and you want to take care of your baby. I'm sure it's important to you. I hear you're saying that and it's kind of like you didn't expect that information."
"no, no, no, no,"
what would you like to do next to help you think about moving away from alcohol consumption during pregnancy?
"if I can show my partner and-and-and get them support, I think that will help me, uh, first thing. today, when I'm home, I think it's the best thing."
"you're talking about a big step. you want to put the alcohol away, that's great. that's a big step."
yes.
"I'm wondering if we can continue this conversation with you today, and I'm wondering if we can continue to talk about the steps, and how it goes with talking to your partner about the idea of drinking. do you think you'd be open to it?"
"yeah, I think it would be a good idea, and maybe you could help me, like, ways to approach it, because I think my partner has the same opinion as I- that I have. so-so-so-so"
we'll definitely be able to do it again. I'm glad you came to see me.
yes. thank you. Thank you. Thank you
"hello, Andrea, thanks for coming."
hello. Hi. Hi. Hi. thank you. Thank you. Thank you
I'm not really sure what you know about my role here and why you're here. I'd like to tell you a little bit about myself.
"all right, all right, all"
"in fact, I'm supposed to meet all the students. once or twice a semester, I'll talk to you about how things are going, and I'll talk about what you might want to do if you decide to change your life. changing you isn't my job. I'd rather not even if I wanted. it's not my place. you know, it's really helpful to think about how things are going to be for you and how you might want to change things."
"all right, all right, all"
"all right, so it sounds good?"
yes.
"all right, let's go. Let. so tell me a little about yourself."
"sure. I'm Andrea, I'm a junior in the marching band. I'm playing the tenor sax."
"all right, so, so, so,"
"yeah, I'm a little geeky about the band. I'm playing in the wind ensemble and the jazz band."
"wow, that's really cool. you're really into music."
"yes, [crosstalk]."
when did you start?
"in fact, I've been playing for a decade."
"wow, that's really cool."
"I've been playing the violin first, then I started with the piano, then I started with the clarinet, then I started with the saxophone."
"it's really nice. It's really. I wanted to be good at music. all right, let's have a little fun. you're in a band and a couple of other musical groups, you've got a lot of hobbies and things you like to do?"
"you know, just hanging out with my friends or going to the beach."
mm-hmm.
yes.
kind of everyday stuff?
"yeah, I'm laughing."
"all right, all right, all. tell me a little about your family."
he's eight and a half years older than me. my parents and I have a dog.
it's a nice little girl. what kind of dog is that?
he's a Golden Retriever.
"all right, so, so, so,. all right, all right, all"
"my big boy, my big boy."
"it's a great game. all right, let's go. Let. how's it going to be at school?"
"they're really good. the grades were fine. still, it's 3.7."
"all right, so you're doing well. what's the goal after college?"
"I'd like to go to high school, of course, and I hope I'm going to go to a good school."
"all right, all right, all right, all"
but it's not likely. then I'd like to go to the doctor. you're going to study psychology and then you're going to be a psychiatrist
"all right, you've got a pretty big dream."
yes.
that's great. It's great. it's really exciting to think about that.
yes.
"-and I'm looking forward to the future and the future. all right, let's go. Let. well, I'll ask you something, you know, people have different things they really value in their lives. everything, you know, their cultural identity or their family or their friends or their job or hobbies. here's a little sheet that's just a basic value that, um, might be more or less important to some people."
mm-hmm.
"as a part of the community or sense of community. family, friendship, modesty, religion, respect, self-determination and spirituality. so, what are the most important things in your life to you?"
"well, I think it's a sense of community and belonging."
"all right, all right, all"
I'm thinking of two and respect.
"I'm sorry, but I respect you. why did you pick those three?"
"yes. I think it's a community and belonging. you know, I said I was in the marching band?"
mm-hmm.
"being in the team setting, you know, I really like it, you know, I really like it."
mm-hmm.
"in terms of respect, I think it's like a rule. I think it's important to respect yourself and respect others."
"all right, all right, all"
that's very important to me.
"all right, so, great. you know, it's a sense of belonging, like you said."
mm-hmm.
"in a way, it's a sense of purpose."
"yes, that's what it is."
then it's really all-encompassing respect.
"yes, I'm sure."
"not just authority, but respect for yourself, respect for your friends and your bandmates and others. all right, that's great."
"of course, it's true."
"all right, let's go. Let. well, I wanted to talk to you about something related to belonging and your friends. what do you like to do with your friends?"
"well, sometimes we go to the movies, we go to the beach, we're just playing some good games, like I said, or sometimes we're just at someone's house."
"when you're with friends, is there ever alcohol?"
"yes, sometimes."
"all right, all right, all. how does alcohol fit into your social life?"
"it's mostly just for, for parties or party settings, it's a little bit of a party."
"mm-hmm, mm-hmm. and so when you're at the party, there's a lot of alcohol?"
yes.
"all right, all right, all. how often do you think you're drinking?"
"I'd say about two weekends out of the month, for instance, not busy. two, three, two, three."
"mm-hmm. you drink half a time, and you don't drink. what's different about the days you choose to drink or not drink?"
"it's mostly just parties, so it's more of a party and dancing and, you know, it's fun. then it's much more relaxed when we don't. it's much more of a hangout, playing board games, watching a movie."
"so what activity is it, and if alcohol is there?"
of course.
"all right, all right, all. do you notice a big difference in your enjoyment or do you know the difference between the night you play board games versus the night you're playing?"
"it's meant to be relaxing, you know, like playing board games and things."
mm-hmm.
it's nice to have a little breather.
uh-huh.
"it's much more energetic, much more exhausting, after all this."
mm-hmm.
but it's fun to dance and have fun.
"all right, all right, all. so there's a pro and a con on both sides?"
yes.
"all right, all right, all. what do you like to drink or drink?"
"well, when we drink, we tend to have more fun, you know, because we're all drinking. we're much more relaxed and relaxed."
mm-hmm.
"-and it can be - and it can be - when it's too much drinking, it can be - and it can be - and it can be - and it can be - and"
"all right, all right, all. so you know, can you tell me a little bit of the bad things about alcohol?"
it's going to make people stupid a lot of times. people make stupid decisions and things like that. we're usually trying to be safe.
mm-hmm.
"-as much as possible. we'll sleep at a friend's house. so we don't drive, but mostly with our friends. we don't worry about strangers putting weird things in our drinks."
mm-hmm.
"well, of course, when they drink and they can be really stupid."
mm-hmm. you want to try to avoid dangerous activities?
"yes, yes, yes,"
"you try to stay, but you don't. you try to keep your friends. well, it seems like there's still some-some things going on."
"sometimes, sometimes. yes."
do you have a little bit of information?
"well, I'm not really enjoying it when we drink too much, and we end up like throwing up or something like that."
yes. it's never fun to throw up.
it's not.
how often do you think it's going to happen?
"it happened to me once. I drank a lot, I didn't know what I was doing. I've been mixing things and taking everything everyone gave me."
mm-hmm.
-and it's not going to be good.
mm-hmm.
"but after that, I'm not- but I'm still having to take care of my friends, so I'm gonna have to do it."
"all right, all right, all"
it's a little depressing for me.
"uh-huh. all right, all right, all. on the one side, people relax a little bit more, they're a little more relaxed, they're a little more relaxed, they're a little more relaxed, on the other hand, they're a little more relaxed."
yes.
"-because you have to be careful about what you're doing or what you can do. well, sometimes you can get a little drunk, and you can get a little drunk, and you can get a little drunk, and you can get a little drunk, and you can get a little drunk, and you can get a little drunk, and. all right, all right, all. and the other one of the bad things about alcohol?"
"yes. I guess people can be a little sloppy. like they're all loose, like they're doing things in the corner."
mm-hmm.
-and that's what I'm talking about.
you're stuck with things you don't want to see.
yes.
"I have it. all right, all right, all. all right, so, uh, so, uh. you've mentioned a couple of times that you've tried to limit the danger of drinking. why did you make the decision?"
I'm an alcoholic aunt. I see the issues involved and I know that drunk driving is a problem.
mm-hmm.
"so, I'd like to be as safe as possible, and I'd like to be in a safe place, like my parents would tell me something. but. I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I"
mm-hmm.
so I'm going to enjoy it.
"all right, all right, all. it's a little like your respect for yourself."
yes.
"on the other hand, the drink may help the community start with the community."
mm-hmm.
"if it's too much, it's a little."
so it's a little bit of a defeat. [laughing]
"all right, so let's go. and then, with respect, you mentioned something, and I really wanted to respect myself and not cross the line."
yes.
how do you think the drink is going to fit in?
what about what. in respect of what?
mm-hmm.
I think it's probably a form of disrespect to my body because I don't want to put things in it that shouldn't be there.
"all right, all right, all"
but I'm trying to keep my house and try to limit my drinking so I don't get drunk like throwing a blackout.
mm-hmm.
"you know, try to be as loose as possible, but don't let go of me."
mm-hmm.
"I'm not sure where to go, I don't know what, and"
mm-hmm.
-such things as that.
"all right, all right, all. you want to balance it out."
yes.
"-how much you drink to have a positive effect, but not to go over."
"all right, all right, all. what did you come up with. do you have a limit or are you--?"
"I usually start with a drink so I know what's in it and how much is in it. so I'm controlling how much I drink. I usually just drink one cup and then I'm going to have a drink. then I'll try to keep it going as long as possible. ""all right, I'll have a drink"" and I'm fine. I'm still in my cup, so people don't want to say, ""Oh, here."". ""you have a little more."". ""no, I'm fine. I'll have mine, and I'll be happy to let it go."
"mm-hmm. all right, all right, all. do you think it's working well or sometimes you exceed it?"
"it's pretty good, because, like I said, people are asking me, trying to pressure me, I'm like, ""No, I'm fine."". I've got something. I've got something. I'll see you later, I'll see you later. I'm never gonna get anything. they'll all be like, ""Let's go,"" and everyone will be like, ""Let's go."". ""all right, maybe I'll take one more."". and that's when I'm starting to fall-"
"all right, all right, all"
-I'm too much.
"well, uh, uh, you know, maybe you'd like to have a little bit of a time to work with it."
yes.
-I'd like to make some changes-
mm-hmm.
"-to make it a little easier. all right, all right, all. how important is it to you to change your drinking habits or change your drinking habits to fit with your values and your goals?"
"I'd like to try to drink less, you know, in terms of respect for myself and my body."
"all right, all right, all"
"you know, it's nice to have fun, but I'd like to have fun, you know."
"all right, so let's go"
"by the time I'm 22, my liver's not working."
mm-hmm.
"well, you know, my friends and I have a similar mindset, so we can work together as a group."
uh-huh. so you're all together-
yes.
"- Goals. all right, all right, all. you-you're supposed to cut back on your drinking, right. what's important to you is to work on this goal and on a scale of 1 to 10, where one is not important and ten is the most important thing?"
I'd say it's like a 6 or 7.
"all right, all right, all right,"
"I'd like to work, but if I'm working, I'll work. if I'm not, I'm not."
uh-huh. why do you say six or seven?
"well, because I think it's important."
uh-huh.
"you know, I've been thinking about it. as I said, I'm not gonna hurt my body. especially in school, where you know how your body affects your body and your school work and everything. you know, when I'm at college, it's not going to work out, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you. as I'm sure it's not possible. it's not a good idea."
you can't keep drinking like this and you won't be able to achieve your goals.
yes.
"all right, all right, all. well, how confident are you that you'll be able to cut?"
I'm thinking of the fact that I'm
-on the same scale from one to ten?
"I'm sure if I made the decision, I'd definitely be a 10."
"wow, that's really cool. all right, all right, all. why are you saying 10?"
"I know I can do it when I make the decision. first of all, he makes a decision."
"all right, all right, all. you've mentioned a couple of reasons why you'd like to cut. you've thought about how you might go about it?"
"you know, I think I might try to convince my friends without sounding, you know, like, you know, let's just go. we don't go out, or we'll be late. or just don't drink today, I don't drink. and then if my friends do it, they drink with me and they don't do it, and then they're fine with it."
"well, uh, I'm trying to plan more activities that don't involve alcohol."
yes.
-and also trying to participate in activities that don't involve drinking or even less than you drink.
yes.
"all right, all right, all. do you want to work on this goal?"
I'm sure. it's very likely that it's true. I'm sure it's possible.
"all right, all right, all. so I guess we'll talk about less alcohol. I only make notes to myself and then maybe, uh, reducing the amount of alcohol you drink. all right, all right, all. you said it was possible, right. would it be okay if we met in a couple of weeks?"
I'm sure. I'm sure it's good.
do you think you'd like to do something like that?
yes.
"all right, all right, all. you know, I really appreciate you talking to me, you know, it sounds like you have a lot of great goals, really ambitious goals of going to medical school and, you know, becoming a psychiatrist. you really look forward to going to school."
"you have a pretty active social life and a lot of friends who would probably support you, even if you cut down on alcohol, you know, there's a lot of benefits."
"I'd be very happy to talk to you about how you're planning to do it, and if you're interested, I'd be happy to talk to you about how you're planning to do it."
"yes, I'd like to."
"all right, let's go. Let. all right, so let's get. in a couple of weeks, I'll see you."
"all right, so let's go. all right, so, so,"
"all right, so let's get"
"hello, I'm glad you're here. what's the problem or what's the reason for your arrival?"
"I'm sick of my drink. I drink too much. well, I thought, uh, maybe I should talk to someone."
"all right, so you're thinking about drinking now?"
"over the last six months, it's gotten worse?"
"all right, all right, all. what's the point of saying it's worse?"
"well, I drank, you know, like most people do, but I've been dating a guy for a year and a half, and then six months ago I wanted to go."
"all right, all right, all"
"well, I've been drinking a lot of alcohol, now, since Friday and Saturday."
"yes, I'm sure."
"well, I'm trying to meet guys."
sure.
"well, I've been drinking more and more in the last few months, and I've never done it before."
"all right, so you know what I mean, you noticed the last six months, right. I'm going to try to meet a-a-a partner again, and I'm going to try to drink more."
yes. I'm not comfortable talking to men. [chuckles]
"all right, all right, all"
"I'm not sure what to say, but drinking is good."
"sure, sure. so you're noticing that the drink is a way to calm down the nerves?"
"of course, I'm sure."
to talk to potential partners?
"of course, of course."
"who-who-who, boys?"
yes.
"all right, all right, all"
"I guess, like most people drink when they go."
"all right, all right, all"
I guess I've been drinking more and more.
sure.
"well, I don't really meet people, I just end up with a huge hangover the whole weekend."
"it's interesting, isn't it. you know, it's a little bit of a coin, you know, like, you know, it's a little bit of a coin, you know, it's a little bit of a coin."
yes.
"-you don't have to talk to the same guy, but he doesn't work. and that's why it's gonna cause hangovers or?"
"I mean, I'm just, uh, I'm just too drunk and I'm just, uh, I'm just too drunk."
"all right, so I guess what you'd like to do if you had the situation?"
I guess I'm just gonna stop. I'm drinking more and more because I'm doing it in the week.
yes.
"I mean, I just don't want to do it anymore."
"all right, all right, all"
"I'm just not eating properly anymore, I'm just eating less or just eating something, I'm just eating something."
"all right, all right, all"
"-um, I feel like I don't have to. well, I don't have to exercise as much as I used to. you know, I'd like to cut, you know, stop drinking."
"all right, all right, so, uh, you're really interested in stopping drinking, especially on the weekend?"
"yes. yes, I'm sure. yes."
"you know, because you noticed that it had a negative impact on what you eat."
"yes. I'm not gonna stop, so I don't want to."
"no, I'm sure. yes. when you go out, it seems like it's helpful, it's a little bit of a comfort for you, so you feel a little better when you talk to-to guys."
"yeah, and everyone goes out and drinks. as I-"
yes.
-I wouldn't have had a social life if I hadn't.
yes.
"""no, I don't drink,"" and I'm not saying that I'm an alcoholic."
sure.
-or I'm not interested in it anymore
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. you know, then there's some benefits. it's something that's quite fun, hanging out with friends and-and going out. so, it's not a case of removing him completely, but it's a case of, ""Okay, I'm noticing it's affecting me more than I want."". yes. all right, all right, all right,"
"yes, it's a little out of control."
did you ever try to cut down on drinking?
"no, it's not like that."
is there anything like this for the first time?
"well, I've been with my friend for six years, and I've been with him for six years."
"yes, yes, yes."
"well, before that, my friends didn't drink much, and they were just new. yes."
"all right, all right, all right,. you know, it's great that you can identify what's going on right now and you know, you almost picked up on a little pattern too."
mm-hmm.
"-as to why you drink. in terms of reducing the amount of alcohol, you know, on a scale of 0 to 100, 100, uh, meaning it's very important to you and 0 doesn't mean anything. what's important to you to cut down on alcohol?"
"I guess it's 80, I guess that's why I'm here."
"by the time you come to-to talk about it, you have already taken a big step forward."
yes.
"well, I guess it's 80, so what do you say is 80?"
"I don't know, I just-I don't know, it just seemed too much, like no one else was really interested in it."
"all right, all right, all"
"-as I said, just for the reasons I said, just to see what I'd like to do."
"all right, so you have a real sense of, ""I have to do something."""
"it seems like it's going to get worse, uh, what it seems like."
that's what it looks like.
yes.
"you noticed that the last six months have been a pattern that you've noticed more and more, um, a negative impact on your life. I'd like to do something about it."
yes.
"all right, so what do you think the next step is?"
"well, I guess that's why I'm here. [chuckles]"
yes.
I'm really needed for the week.
"all right, all right, all"
"well, I guess, try to plan a little bit more on the weekend."
"all right, all right, all"
-so it's not going to be crazy.
"all right, so you think about trying to keep the alcohol out of the week. you said that was what you meant?"
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. yes, I'm sure."
"all right, how do you think it's going to be a first step?"
"no, that's good, that's-that's, yes, that's definitely what I'm gonna do."
"all right, all right, all"
"I'm so out of the routine, I don't even exercise, I'm just."
"all right, you're really angry about it."
"yeah, but I think it's just talking about it, so I'm thinking, I'm thinking, I'm thinking, I'm thinking, I'm thinking, I'm thinking"
"all right, that's great, all right."
"all right, Jacob, everything looks pretty normal on your physical examination. do you want to ask me something?"
"no, no, no, no"
"all right, all right, all. I see you've filled out the questionnaire about alcohol and drugs. is it okay if we're going through this together?"
sure.
"all right, all right, all. we're talking about confidential things. if you give me permission, I'll only tell you what we're saying to your parents. is that what it is?"
yes.
"all right, all right, all. so, let's take a look. I see you've used alcohol to relax, feel better, or you've used alcohol to relax. can I talk to you a little about your alcohol consumption?"
"it's not a big deal. we drink a little beer with my friends, sometimes we drink a little beer, sometimes we drink a little beer."
"all right, how many times do you have?"
"maybe three, four, maybe. I'm not going to keep track."
"all right, all right, all. how often do you have them?"
I guess it's about once a month.
"all right, all right, all. you drink with friends, maybe three or four times a month, or mixed drinks. how long have you been doing this?"
"since October, I've been thinking about it."
"so, for about six months. I'm curious about what you're thinking. what's the best thing to drink?"
what's so good about it?
yes.
"well, I'm not sure. it's fun to drink with friends, like when we're at a party, and we're drinking with someone we don't know. it's good, it's good. It"
"all right, all right, all. when you drink with friends, you feel relaxed and you're having fun."
mm-hmm.
"all right, all right, all. I'm also curious, do you have any of your alcohol use?"
"well, I'm sick of hangovers in the morning."
mm-hmm.
"-when I'm throwing up, I'm not happy."
"did you ever experience a blackout, like when you drank and you woke up and you didn't remember what happened?"
but I know someone who did it.
"all right, all right, all. did you ever have a problem with alcohol, like at home or school or somewhere else?"
I missed the first period of school because I had a hangover.
mm-hmm.
"mom said I had a hangover, and she said I'd be sick of it."
mm-hmm. did your mother tell you to drink with your friends?
"after two weeks, I was grounded. [chuckles]"
"so you drink more, and you're more likely to get into trouble with your mom and miss school?"
"yeah, but I've missed school a couple of times."
"all right, all right, all. you didn't ride in a car with someone who drank and you didn't drive a car. so you're saying it's true?"
yes.
"that's great. It's great. I hope you don't do anything like that. I'm concerned about your drinking as a doctor. when teens drink, they can cause problems, like injury. even if you don't drink too much, your brain is still developing and is sensitive to alcohol."
"all right, all right, all"
that's why I'm not recommending any of my adolescents drink. what number would you pick if you were thinking about how ready you were to stop drinking alcohol?
I guess it's five.
"a five. so, I'm curious about what you're thinking. why don't you pick a lower number, like a two or three, so you're not ready to stop drinking?"
"well, I guess I'm tired of being in trouble."
"all right, all right, all. what can you do to avoid trouble?"
"no, no, no, no, no,"
did you ever try to stop drinking?
"no, I don't think so."
"all right, all right, all. for a while, people try to stop drinking for a while just to see what it's like."
I'd probably be able to do it.
how long do you think you'll be without a drink?
I'm not sure.
you're not gonna drink for two months?
"yes, I'm sure."
"all right, all right, all. what would it be easier for you to not drink?"
"when my friends drink, I'm sure I'll have something else."
do you want something else to make things easier?
I'm sure my friends who don't drink or invite them to parties and I'm having a good time.
"all right, all right, all. can you talk to someone about this, who would support you not to drink?"
yes. they would be happy to support me if I didn't drink.
"all right, so let's get. you came up with a reason to stop drinking, like you had a hangover and you got drunk. you have some strategies to avoid drinking, like spending more time with friends who don't drink or not drinking alcohol. that's a great plan. you gave it a try, and I'm really proud of you. I'll see you in two months, and then I'll see how it goes."
"all right, all right, all"
"so, Rick, for the moment, Tristan's situation with your roommate. we talked about how you're going through this program and how your parents and your parents help you. if you're staying with Tristan, I'd like to rethink. what's the best and worst of it. what's good about living here, what's not so good about living here?"
it's a nice place. it's a little bit of work. it's good to live with someone.
"yes. so, in terms of supporting you and supporting you, you'll need to make these changes."
yes.
what do you think about this?
"that's what it is, right. if I'm going to change my mind, I don't know if it's the best place for me."
mm-hmm.
Tristan is a good friend of mine.
yes.
"now we're going in a different direction. he's not the same responsibility I have, and so-- And I'm not gonna change him, just because I want to change mine."
"all right, so let's go"
but I'm not sure how much I'd like to move with my aunt and uncle.
"all right, all right, all. how much do you know about Chris-Christian-Christian, Tristan, about how you changed your life. what do you really know about the changes you want to make?"
"he sat down and talked to him, and he said he would support me and everything. but, like I said, he's in a different place than I am."
mm-hmm.
he's not having kids.
"all right, so let's go"
"he's not really able to understand what I mean. well, he's a good friend."
"all right, all right, all. what are the advantages and disadvantages of moving to the whāna?"
"the food will be good. I'm really supportive, but I'm worried about losing my freedom. I'm afraid they'll take over, or, you know what I mean. I'm in charge of myself now. it's probably going to be really good."
"freedom and freedom to do what we want, and to build your family, and to enable you to do it, and to enable you to do it, and to enable you to do it, and to enable you to do it, and to enable you. what do you want to keep, or how do you handle it?"
"if I lose my kids, I don't want to keep freedom. I just, uh, I'm just worried about. I'm worried about if I'm going to go to my family."
mm-hmm.
I'm not sure. I'll do anything to get my kids back.
"hello, Sarah, I'm glad you're here. I'm Delwyn, and I'm a counselor at the clinic. your nurse practitioner told me you've been taking a yearly exam for smoking and alcohol. can I ask you a little bit about this?"
"I met my nurse practitioner last week, and she was worried about how much I drink and smoke. I've agreed to work on smoking and try to cut it down. but I don't drink much, as far as I'm concerned."
"you decided to cut back on smoking a little, but you don't really care about your drink."
"well, I'm not drinking much, and honestly, it's a good way to calm down."
it's a nice way to relieve stress.
"yes, exactly. in the end, it's like I'm at the end of the day."
it's a little escape from the busy schedule.
"yes. I've been working full-time for two years. and I've also started to go to school. you know, I'm trying to juggle all this. it's tiring, and I'm tired, and I want to relax and enjoy myself."
"you work, and then you're juggling work and school?"
"yeah, and I'm a waitress for work. you know, it's really tiring all day."
it's a pretty exhausting job.
"it's hard to please customers all day. and then I'm worried, you know, I'm making enough money to support my son."
"you don't just work, you're also worried about your finances."
"well, I have to figure out how I'm going to pay for everything when I go back to school. well, it's just a little bit of a problem right now."
"yes, it's true. it seems like you're trying to deal with a lot of things, and it seems like you need a break or reward."
mm-hmm.
"so, tell me a little bit more about your drink. tell me a little about how much you drink, and, um, what you're worried about."
"all right, that's what it is. I don't really understand what's so worrying. you know, I'm not drinking much. I've been drinking for two or three drinks a day."
"you drink, maybe, two drinks a day. I wonder what recommendations have been made for drinking?"
"not much, but it's not much"
"all right, will you be interested in hearing about those recommendations?"
sure.
"all right, all right, all. women should have no more than three drinks a day, and no more than seven drinks in a week. well, the reason for those recommendations is to reduce the risk of accidents, or chronic disease, or even death. as well as high blood pressure, or mental health problems. what do you think about it?"
"well, I'm surprised, because I mean, two drinks a day, that doesn't seem so risky or risky. and, they drink a lot more than I do, and it's not a problem for them. so, I'm surprised."
"when compared to your family, it doesn't seem so abnormal."
"no, no, no, no. you know, I'm really annoyed, really, because I've agreed to try to smoke, you know. it's like I'm being taken away from everything I like, like everything I've enjoyed. you know, if I'm not drinking, what will I enjoy?"
you're really interested in the reward.
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes"
so you've probably increased your drinking a little bit over the time?
"yeah, I guess it's true. you know, it's probably just because you're stressed out. it's a lot of things, and I'm in school for the second semester. I'm trying to figure out how to carry a baby. mom's not always looking at my son, but lately, she can't. you know, I'm always worried about her. so, I-I-I-I-I-I-"
"you know, the more stressed you are, the more you drink."
"yeah, I-I guess it's true."
"so, I'll summarise what you've told me. you seem to have a pretty stressful life, and you're really looking for something-"
uh-huh.
"-a reward or stress relief. well, you know, you noticed that your drinking has increased a little bit. and the more stressed you are, the more you drink."
yes.
I wonder if you noticed any problems with alcohol?
"no, no, no, no. I guess, you know, the one thing I'd like to do is, you know, I'd like to have a little son a little earlier, just so I could have a little time alone. well, you know, sometimes I feel guilty, but, you know, I'd rather be alone and relax, you know. so - so - so - so"
you noticed that the evenings started to call you a little.
yes.
maybe you're taking things that are more important to you?
yes.
and it's not good for you?
"no, no, no, no"
"yes. it's not the occasional drink that's a problem, but it's not the occasional drink. well, it's really about the quantity of drinking, and whether it's going to escalate and interfere with things that are, maybe, more important."
yes.
you may not have seen him in this light.
"no, no, no, no. right now, it's really hard to take. yeah, I'm sure. I didn't think about it like that. well, I-I'm a little worried about it."
it seems like a difficult pattern to change.
"yes. you know, I-I-I don't want to sacrifice anything I like, but, you know, I'm trying really hard, you know, I-I'm trying to be a good mom. I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I. I'm trying to do it. if I don't have a way to relax or enjoy myself, I'm not gonna do it."
it seems like it's going to be difficult to change because it's something really important to you.
yes.
but it's also possible that you value things that you don't want to drink.
yes.
I guess I'm wondering if you've thought of other ways to deal with stress without drinking.
"I'd be better if I could relieve some stress, and, you know, maybe at night, I'd be better."
"so, if you could somehow deal with these stressful situations, what would it be, for example?"
"well, I'm probably the biggest problem for my kids. mom's usually watching my son, but lately she's been a little quiet. I'm worried, am I going to miss work today. you know, I'm really stressed out about it, you know."
it could also make a big difference to have a reliable nursery.
"of course, of course."
"maybe your mom was a possibility in the past, but maybe not so much anymore."
"yes. she's so much of a watch. she probably got a little stressed out. I'm sorry, but it's not her son, so I don't have to worry about her, but I'm worried about something that I can rely on."
"if you can find a reliable, affordable childcare, that would help you not want to drink as much, then it would be a big thing."
yes.
any other things?
"money always brings me problems. I'd be able to afford daycare, I'd work less hours, you know. so, yeah, so, yeah. it's usually about money."
"yes. money can make a big difference, and you're working full time and trying to go to school to address it. well, you know, it sounds like you have some ideas about how you might handle stress better. well, I guess, given our conversation, I'm wondering what you think about everything."
"we've been talking about how you drink a little bit, and it's a risky area, and we should probably cut it. well, you don't seem to be interested in doing it, but it seems like it's important to you. but I don't know if you're ready to tackle this or if you want to go ahead with it. I just wonder where you're going."
"yes. I'm ready to change my drink, but I don't know if I want to. I'm trying to solve a lot of problems."
"so, um, maybe it would be useful if you only focused on one thing, and what would it be?"
I guess it's going to be a little bit
"all right, all right, all. yes. it seems like the main issue is everything you've said. I guess you've looked at alternatives, but I'm wondering if you've looked at alternatives, more affordable, reliable childcare?"
"not really. I'm usually looking at my mom, so I don't really look around."
"all right, all right, all. you might consider talking to a social worker who specializes in helping people who have a lot of things to do, uh, things you didn't think of or don't know. so, I'm thinking of something like that, right?"
"of course, of course."
"all right, all right, all. all right, so let's get. I'm sure you'll be fine with it, and you can-"
mm-hmm.
"-um, you know, you can help me with your problems with your kids. would you like to talk to me about something, like, for example, something like, what do you want to do, uh, what do you want to talk about?"
"yeah, I'd say that. it's nice to talk about everything."
"yes. in a week, it won't be a problem. it will take a while to solve. all right, so, great. so, uh, we have a couple of things to do."
mm-hmm.
anything else?
mm-mm-mm-mm-mm
do you want to think about what you want to achieve with your drinking?
"instead of two, I'd like to try to go to one drink a night."
"all right, all right, all. you can try to cut a little."
"yes. I-I don't know how it goes, especially with trying to cut down on smoking, but I guess I can try."
"all right, all right, all. you can go and try it, and you might find out what it's going to be, and you might find out what it's like to deal with stress."
yes.
"all right, all right, all. so, we have two options, right?"
I'm not sure.
"all right, all right, all. all right, that's good. so, what have you been doing to cut down on your drinking, and what did you think when you met with a social worker. all right, so, so, so"
yes.
"all right, so, great. next time, I'm looking forward to talking."
"all right, all right, all. thank you."
I was wondering if you'd like to talk about your drink before we go to visit today.
"all right, what do you want to say?"
"you've done us a great job today, which is great. thank you very much. I'm just gonna check a couple of things. you've been drinking for three or four times a week, you drink three or four times a week, you drink more than that. there's a six-pack of drinks."
mm-hmm.
is that what it looks like?
"yeah, uh, on the weekend?"
"all right, all right, all right,. I'm a little worried about your drinking. I just wondered if you thought about the connection between drinking and anxiety and insomnia that you've had today?"
"no, I guess I'm not thinking much about it. in the first place, I don't drink much."
mm-hmm.
-I'm not sure if it's causing me anxiety.
mm-hmm.
I'm more likely to sleep on the nights I don't drink.
"you don't have to drink, but many people think it helps them sleep better, and in fact, it's a rebound effect, and this rebound effect means that you wake up."
"yeah, I'm supposed to wake up at 2: 00 in the morning, and I drink too much."
"mm-hmm. I only wanted to show you this chart. you drink more than those at a low risk for your age. no more than 14 drinks a week and no more than four a day. in this case, the drink is considered 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or an ounce and a half of distilled spirits. you're right, you don't drink as much as people. you're actually in the category of high-risk, risky or hazardous, category two."
"oh, my God, no. I'm not so bad."
"that's why it's useful to look at it and see what it's like. what would you change if you were 1 to 10, I'd change it, but 10 would change me?"
"I'm not sure. it's all news to me. I've always thought of myself as a pretty healthy guy, and I've always thought of myself as a pretty good guy. I'd say five."
"all right, that's great. it's going to be half-way. what's keeping you from just giving it a little?"
"I'm training for the marathon, and that's why I'm here, so I'm not thinking of myself as a dangerous drinker, but I'm also not thinking of myself as a dangerous drinker. so, that's why the middle ground is 5."
"mm-hmm. all right, all right, all. all right, so let's start with this place. you said you were important to your health, and you wanted to run a marathon, so you wanted to do what you could to make it successful. you're also a little surprised that you've fallen into this dangerous or risky category."
"yes, I'm sure."
"all right, all right, all. what do you think about changing now, based on all this information?"
I-I'd like to cut my drinking a little.
mm-hmm. so what do you think it will look like?
"I guess I drink three or four times a week, and on the weekend, I drink more than five or six beers."
"all right, all right, all right,. if people don't want to change their plans, it helps if they write them down, so they can see them in black and white. what would you say to your goal if you looked at this little form and figured out where you wanted to go?"
I guess I'm going to have 18 drinks a week.
"all right, all right, all. that's a good thing. so you're going in the right direction. you know, I'd recommend you to stay below this level of risk for 18 drinks a week, and that you would be recommended to stay below 14 or less a week. I'm really glad you took a look at this and tried to make some improvements, and I'm really glad you're willing to look at it and try to improve."
thank you.
I hope you'll be able to talk about this next month at your appointment.
sure.
"all right, all right, all. all right, all right, all"
"the Minnesota State Mankato report states that you were stopped on the road to the stadium last Friday, and you were taken to a detox facility. plus, the report says you're 20. what's the accuracy of the report. and can I share some details about the incident?"
"I'm sure it's right. it happened a week ago. I'm going to my friend's house, and I'm going to go to the game, and then I'm going to go home and have a couple of beers. we drank a little more than usual. I had to go home and I couldn't find a ride. I'm just driving."
"you've been drinking too much, and you're disappointed in how the Vikings play. you decided to go home when your roommate couldn't take you. I'm sure I've got it right now?"
"yes. that's exactly how it happened. I'm a normal college student. I'm drinking and hanging out with my friends. I didn't have a big party, but I was arrested."
"you wanted to watch the game with your friends, so I understand you wanted to have a good time. you didn't think about what could happen when you drank alcohol when you were at your friend's house, but you didn't want to be safe."
"yes. I've tried to be careful. I've been trying to call her roommate, but I don't know, it's going to be a problem."
what did you tell me about what brought you here today?
"well, I'd say I'm a problem with alcohol. I'd probably have a problem like that. they drink like fish and I drink like a fish."
you seem to attribute bad luck to your current situation. what consequences might you have if you believe what you want to do and you don't try to change your behavior?
I guess - I guess it's more of a problem with the police and the school.
what's important to avoid future problems with the police or school?
"God, it's a shame. it's important, because just-just to detox was-was terrible, the experience - I don't want to do it again. my father said if I'm suspended, I'm going to work on my uncle's farm in Iowa. when I was drunk, my parents took my car away from me."
yes. what would you do to prevent going to the detox?
I guess I'd rather not drink too much and I'd rather avoid situations where I'm more likely to be in trouble. I guess I'm not gonna drink so much.
how confident are you that you'll be able to carry out the plan with 10?
I guess I'd say about half. maybe it's six.
what steps can you take to move the six to the seventh?
"I guess I could, uh, I don't know. I guess, the big thing would be like if I drank like I drank like I drank like I drank like I drank like I drank like I drank like I drank like I drank like I drank like I drank like I drank like I drank like I drank. I guess there's more to do than just drink, like, I guess there's more to do than just drink."
what changes would you make if you succeed?
"well, I guess the big one would be like I'm not going to be hungover like I would have been, even if I'm at 8: 00. I'll sleep at 8: 00, and then I'm going to miss everything that's on the test. I'm probably helping me succeed if I think what's important to me. I've had a 3.5 grade in high school. so I'm sure I'd be able to do it."
the college is about choosing. do you have any beliefs and values that have influenced your decision-making and how they relate to your drinking?
"my family and I really care about education. I've always talked about it and I really want to be a journalist, I mean, I have the face. I guess if I'm thinking about what I need to do, I'll be less likely to drink. I'd probably be able to do a good job with my parents."
thank you for coming to the event. you will be placed on a university disciplinary probation and attend a seminar on alcohol for $150.
"okay, okay, okay, okay, okay,. when's the seminar coming up?"
do you want to answer some questions and talk about how you feel about alcohol and contraception?
sure.
"all right, all right, all. so we're working on a 10-point scale, 1 to 10, 1 is not important, 10 is very important. one is not confident, and the other is very confident. so what are the best numbers to reflect how important it is to drink?"
I'd say eight.
"you'd say eight. all right, all right, all. how confident are you at the moment that you can drink at risk levels?"
I'd say four.
four hundred and fifty.
mm-hmm.
"all right, all right, all. so let's see what they're like. you think it's important, but you don't have a lot of confidence. what's so confident you can drink at risk levels and remember what they are?"
I think it's because you told me I was at risk and I'm really worried about my family and I'm not interested in going down that path. so I'm-I'm confident I'll change it.
"all right, all right, all. so you don't drink, that's a good reason. all right, all right, all. any other things?"
"well, I'm with a group of friends who don't drink. it doesn't matter when I'm with them. so I'm also helping you."
so you're a support group that allows you to have fun and still drink at risk?
"yes, I'm sure."
"all right, all right, all. any other things?"
"no, no, no, no,"
let's take a look at your self-evaluation of your birth control. we're now taking risks for pregnancy and birth control. how important is it to use effective birth control every time you have sex?
I'd say eight.
"eight, eight, eight, eight,. all right, all right, all. how confident are you at the moment that you can use effective birth control?"
every time - - - - - -
every time.
-I guess it's six.
"as prescribed, it's perfectly fine."
I guess it's six.
"I guess it's six. all right, all right, all. you're pretty confident you'll do it. why don't you have a six?"
"well, I'm a six because I'm more likely to use birth control if I drink less. I'm not really interested in using it when I drink too much."
"all right, all right, all. you know, if you're drinking, you can take care of it, so."
yes.
-your reasons for not being here are the birth control issue and the importance of this.
"yes, I'm sure."
"well, I'm glad you're here. you use a good method of birth control, but you can't use it effectively. you linked it to the drink. so you're planning on developing a plan for alcohol consumption today?"
when do I leave?
"yes, I'm sure."
"all right, all right, all"
"all right, all right, all. if you want more information, we'll give you the information."
"all right, all right, all"
"all right, all right, all"
can I look at the questionnaire you've filled out before the visit?
"all right, all right, all"
"thank you. if we talk about alcohol and drugs, I'm supposed to share information and learn from what they want to do, if anything. is that what it is?"
yes.
"all right, so let's get. you've been drinking for eight days, so you've been drinking for eight days?"
yes. it's going to be eight days. I don't know. I don't know.
"all right, all right, all. what do you say about your drink?"
"well, I'm just drinking at the party. I'm not drinking at home."
"all right, all right, all. what kind of alcohol do you drink at the party?"
"beer, when people mix, sometimes vodka, but I don't like vodka very much. there's usually a drink like vodka and orange juice or gin and tonics at the party."
how much do you drink at the party?
do you mean the whole time I've been there?
"yes, I'm sure."
I guess four or five drinks.
"all right, so, Speaker 1, I'm going. you've checked the box that you feel better when you drink, you feel better?"
yes. it's relaxing me.
you've also been looking at it when you drink.
yes.
what do you forget about?
I'm forgetting how many drinks I've had with my friends.
you're forgetting where you are.
"all right, so let's go"
"here's the part where I'm gonna share the information. the safest drink for teenagers is zero. when adolescents drink, there are more likely to be negative consequences. alcohol can cause damage to the brain as a teenager and young man who drinks alcohol. sexual assault is more likely to happen, and so is sexual transmission. do you think there's anything about your drinking that could cause you to have a STD?"
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. I've been drinking since I was a kid. he drank too much, and we didn't use a condom."
"when you were having sex, did you agree to it?"
yes. we used to have sex and we used to use a condom.
how did you feel about using a condom this time?
"well, we didn't stop to put it on. we didn't think about it like that."
does drinking change your thinking?
"yes. if I were sober, I'd definitely tell him to put on a condom."
"I'd like to share something else. it's a sign of heavy drinking when people forget where they are or how many drinks they've had. when people drink, it can be a sign of alcohol abuse disorder, which is a symptom of alcohol abuse."
"it's not me, but it's not me. no one will help me."
I'm curious about what you're thinking. what's the best thing to drink?
"well, it's fun, but it's fun. I'm drinking when my friends drink. well, I'm laughing more. it's just a little fun."
"all right, all right, all. what about your drink?"
sometimes I forget where I'm at.
any other things?
I'm not interested in STDs.
"all right, so let's go. you like the relaxed feeling when you drink and on the other hand, you don't like forgetting where you are or forgetting how many drinks you've had."
yes.
"so, when you're thinking about what you like and not liking your drink, where do you want to go. what would you change about your drink?"
I'm definitely not going to drink.
do you want to drink less. what number would you pick if I asked you to choose a number from 0 to 10?
"well, a nine, but a nine."
I'm ready to stop drinking. why do you think you're picking a high number like nine?
I'm not interested in STDs and I'm not interested in wondering if I have them.
"all right, all right, all. what plan do you have to achieve this goal?"
"well, I'd like to count the drinks so I don't have to drink too much."
"all right, so let's get. who's gonna help you get there?"
"well, I'm a friend who thinks I'm drinking too much. I'm sure she'll promise not to drink more than two at the party."
"all right, all right, all. and what about unprotected sex. you don't seem to want to experience it."
I'll talk to him and I'll tell him we're always using a condom and we don't have sex.
"all right, let's go. Let. you have a plan to drink less than two drinks at parties and avoid unprotected sex. I'd like to share what you're doing. when do you think you'll be back in six weeks?"
"all right, all right, all"
"all right, so let's get. I'm glad you talked to me and I'm looking forward to seeing you again."
"so, Chris, I'd like to talk to you. you're a star athlete for us. as a team player, I'm really happy for you. I have a job to watch the players and make sure they're performing at their best. this weekend there was something. I heard some talk about a big party that was going on and I understood you were there. so I'd like to talk to you about how partying and alcohol are in your life."
"all right, I'd like to tell you something that bothers me. as you know, I've been a student, like, a student, like, I've been a student, like, I've been a student, like, I've been a student."
mm-hmm.
"my friends invited me to a party a month ago. I've always done my homework, I've always studied it, and I'm always at the party. well, I convinced my parents that I'd go to my friend's house for the night. so, I've been drinking since then."
mm-hmm.
"you can say it was a unique experience. I guess you'll tell me. in the moment, it was fun. so I've done it, so I'm doing it. instead of studying for the exam, I asked my mom to let me go to the party. she knew what I was doing. I promised her I wouldn't drink, not even a drug. I'll pick you up at 12: 00. and I'm surprised you're here. I told her what I thought, I thought I'd-I'd-I'd-I'd-I'd-I'd-I'd-I'd-I'd-I'd-I'd-I'd-I'd-I'd-. she left me, I promised, and she didn't drink, she didn't drink. we're going, I'm having a good time. I've been drinking. I've been drinking. then she picked me up and took me away. as soon as I'm picked up, I'm not gonna be able to delay her. ""you drank vodka when I picked you up,"" she said. I didn't know what to say. I've just looked at the ground. I'm really bad because I betrayed my mom. I'm not going to drink alcohol with her. that's exactly what I've done."
"so, here's the deal. you're a student of honor. you're a star athlete. you've been involved in the party scene for the last few years, and you've been involved in the party scene for the last few years."
"all right, so let's go"
"it's fun for a minute. you noticed some consequences, but you didn't notice them."
"yes, I'm sure. as I noticed, I'm more lethargic and apathetic to schoolwork."
mm-hmm.
"instead of studying, I was more interested in my friends, who were more interested in finding where I was, especially on the weekend."
it's changed your focus. what's your favorite drink?
"I'm not sure. you know, I'm a very reserved person, for the most part, not when I'm dealing with sports or like. I'm usually pretty self-conscious, so I tend to keep my mouth shut. I feel like I'm relaxed when I drink. I'm more easily able to talk to someone. I'm not sure if it's just -"
"it's going to help you relax, so you can relax."
it's exactly. It's exactly
"you seem to notice a lot of bad things about alcohol, but your mom was angry with you, so you don't seem to be doing very well in school, maybe-"
kind of.
-or anything else?
"just a different group, friends or friends, like a different person who I'm with."
mm-hmm.
"so, that's what it's changed."
there's a little tension between your friends.
"a little bit because they don't like it. well, I'm in a group of friends, and I'm talking to someone else, and then I'm in a different group of friends."
mm-hmm.
so I've been more with them since then. but I'm sure I live life. but it's not fair to them that I didn't do it as much as I did before.
"all right, all right, all"
"you know, they're there for me."
"it's affecting your study, your relationship with your mom, your relationship with your mom. what do you think is the best thing to do?"
"I'd like to stop. like, I don't think I'm unrealistic. I'm sure there will be such situations."
mm-hmm.
"if I don't take it, I can't remember the night before, if I'm sick. I only remember the bathroom."
mm-hmm.
"-it's not worth it, either. it was a big blow to my mother, and I'm slowly building my trust. I guess it's a little bit of a surprise to others."
yes.
but it's a big deal for me.
you really care about your mom.
of course.
it's important to you how she feels about you.
it's exactly. It's exactly
how important is it to you to change your drink or even to stop drinking?
"because I'm afraid of losing my mother's trust, I'm a lot of it."
"all right, all right, all"
and I'm also working on my school work.
"all right, all right, all"
so I'm thinking about the future.
do you think you can change your drinking or quit?
"especially, I'm pretty confident."
"on a scale of 1 to 10, one is not a tenth of a tenth."
I guess it's eight or nine.
"all right, all right, all"
"it's not a 10, it's not like a 10. I feel like there's too much of everything, but I'm determined to."
why don't you say eight or nine?
because I'm not sure I'm going to do it because I'm not happy with how I feel after I betrayed my mother. I'm not gonna remember the feeling of vomiting.
mm-hmm.
"it wasn't a pleasant thing. I don't want to enjoy it. as far as I'm concerned, if I drink, I don't want to drink to the point where it's fun, like I've had enough fun before."
"all right, what do you think is a realistic goal?"
"I'm sure I'll be able to study. first, I need to trust my mother."
mm-hmm.
"-then you're just focused on my studies. if I have a little time for leisure, I'll go to the party with my friends and I'll be fine. I'm not gonna do anything to my life. but I'd rather not. I'd rather just be sure."
you want to avoid drinking or at least one drink at the party.
"it's exactly. It's exactly. I'm just here to participate in the social convention. hey, guys, I'm sorry."
"yes. I'm really glad you're talking to me about it. you know, I think it's something that's really important to you as a student and athlete and I want what's best for you. I'm glad we've been able to talk about it. you seem to have a good plan, you know, really trying to avoid alcohol, if you're in a situation where there's alcohol, you know, you have to limit it to one drink. it seems like you'll be able to do it."
thank you for listening to me. it's a big deal for me.
it's my pleasure. it's my job and I'm sure it's like that. I'll go to practice quickly.
"I'm glad you came today, Nina. I'm looking forward to hearing a little bit about you and what brought you here today."
my doctor's got me. I'm supposed to go because I was a little irresponsible with the pregnancy. yes.
"all right, all right, all. he thinks you're a little irresponsible."
"yes. he said I drank too much. I-I didn't really, but he said it might be, um, it might be a problem."
you feel a little worried about it.
"yes. yes. I'm not gonna fuck anything up with this baby, but, uh, yeah, I'm afraid I've done it."
"all right, all right, all. you care about the consequences, and you really care about your baby, and you want to give your baby a good start."
mm-hmm. yes.
you wonder if we'll spend the time together this time.
"yes. he didn't tell me what he was expecting. ""go see her,"" he said."
"you know, you drank alcohol during pregnancy, so you're sharing that you drank alcohol."
"yes. well, I've been pregnant for two-ish months, so I'm not sure."
"all right, all right, all"
"-and I've been drinking since then. well, I tried not to, but, you know, it's a weekend, and, uh, I've been trying to, you know, but, you know, it's hard to, like, not to."
"mm-hmm. so, the people you care about are in the scene, and the external pressure is coming from them."
"a little bit. it's weird, but if I talk to them, it's okay. like I'm the only one of my friends who's taking this step and they don't know how to handle it."
"it seems like you're in two worlds. you're preparing for motherhood and you're preparing for the birth of your baby, and this world is the world you've been in for a while."
yes.
-drinking and your friends are drinking -
"""all right, it's a party,"" and now I'm like, ""Okay, it's time."""
"all right, all right, all. you want to move out of this world and move into your mom's world. do I want to stay here too?"
"yeah, I want to live it, but I don't want to be able to do it again, like once the baby comes, it's over. I'm sure I'll have to change."
"""I can be both worlds,"" you think, ""but right now, while you're pregnant, I'm thinking, ""I'd like to be in both worlds."". maybe we should go to the mother's world."
yes. I guess so. and I feel like it's too late. I've already fucked up.
"all right, all right, all. you have a lot of concerns about what has happened to you until now. what about drinking alcohol during pregnancy?"
"well, I know, like, they say not to, but I thought, ""Okay. maybe it's not important. maybe it's just what they're telling you. as well as drinking, it's bad."
you thought it must be okay because your friends didn't pressure you to stop drinking.
yes.
and then there's something else in you that's- is thinking maybe it's not okay.
"yeah, I'd probably trust my gut."
"so, what do you think your gut is telling you. tell me about it."
"I'm telling you, what I'm doing is bad and I'm sure it hurts my baby."
"you're really interested in what's best for your girl. you know, you know, you're kind of wondering, um, how to move forward from here, you know, what do you think about, or what do you think about giving up drinking?"
"I'm sure it's not-- I'm sure I could do it. when you're in that moment, it's just-it's hard. you're with your friends and they drink and you don't want to be a mom. you want to be yourself. you want to be the one who used to be."
"you're kind of in the identity, you're in the identity. I'd like to be someone like that, but I don't."
"when they have kids, they disappear from their friends. I'm not the person I want to be. I'm not someone who just has kids and they're completely different."
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry. you know, you embrace the life of the picket fence and the house and the baby."
"yes, the suburbs. yes."
you don't want to be that woman who lives in the house with the baby carriage and the world says it's not your fault.
"yeah, I-I guess. I'm not gonna lose my friends for this. they're good people, and I don't want to put pressure on them. they're just - they're just - they"
you're interested in them.
yes.
"they're still in the scene because they might not have changed your life. you're here now, and you don't know. you're interested in the baby, but you don't know about the suburbs and the fence. you don't know - you don't know -"
I'm not interested in that.
you're not interested in that.
"no, no, no, no"
you're gonna have this baby.
yes.
you want to take care of your baby as the baby grows.
I want to be responsible for it.
you're not gonna let your baby down.
"no, no, no, no"
"but at the same time, it's hard to let go of the past, but you think, ""I'm not going to have a choice."". I have to look like that. "". is that what it's like?"
I'm sure. I've already made a choice and I've made a bad choice.
"Nina, what do you hope for the future. what do you hope to be when you look back?"
"I-I've done it because I wanted to-- It's almost like that push, that sign that I'm going to, like, move forward and become a grown-up. I feel like a teenager sometimes. it's a lot of pressure and I want to raise him well. I'm not gonna let my son down. I don't want to regret choosing the baby, but I don't want to regret it, but I don't want to regret it."
"you're really thinking about the baby, and you think, ""This baby is giving you a new chance to live, or giving you a plan B."""
"well, I guess it's easier to say than to do. like, I can change everything, but at the end of the day, I'm still the same person."
"""I'm still the same girl who drank and danced,"" and-and maybe not living the same, but-and maybe not living the same, but-and maybe not living the same, but-and maybe not living the same, but-and"
yes. you can't just change your mind and become someone else.
"you wonder if you deserve the second chance, ""Do I deserve it?"". and then you're saying, ""Why not?"". I want to go for it."
"yeah, I guess the other one is a little more muted."
"mm-hmm. you're surrounded by a lot of people who are kind of pulling you down, and you're kind of back to your old life. the baby reminds us of the new life we have."
"when it's actually over, it will be very different."
"how confident are you that you can take the new life, and take the new path, and move on to the next path, and you'll be successful in raising the baby?"
I'm sure I'll be successful. I'm not really- I'm not really able to choose. I have to go like that.
"mm-hmm. what do you say, ""I have to go"". what's the reason you want to do it?"
"because I'm gonna have to do it for my son. if I don't, it's all going to be a mess."
"""I'm not able to do this life better,"" you wonder, ""do I have the confidence to do it?"". what do you think you'd like to increase your confidence?"
"maybe- maybe actually talking to my friends and saying, ""Of course, of course, it's a good choice. ""if they really, like, saw it, they might wake up too."
"so you think that when your friends see you with the baby, they'll see the same path?"
they'll feel less pressure to be who they want.
it seems like you're in two worlds.
a little bit.
"it's not easy to be in this world and also to remember that the baby is coming and the baby is saying, ""I want to live better."". who's gonna support you when you look around who's in your circle, who's gonna support you?"
"I'm definitely my parents, and I'm definitely going to meet someone who's gonna have kids, you know, so I can see it, like, like, how it's done. I'm not really sure who has kids recently, so I don't know anyone. you know, I'd like to meet other, you know, young mothers who, you know, are struggling with the same thing I'm struggling with."
"they would support you and support you from giving up the drink, the alcohol, that's something they would support."
I'm not sure they realize how much I'm doing it.
"all right, all right, all"
they would have been really pissed if they knew.
now it's a concern for you and them.
yes.
"yes. maybe we could meet again, maybe we could talk about the family, maybe we could talk about, you know, the people, your friends, your friends who are in the lifestyle."
it's probably the scariest thing to tell my parents.
mm-hmm.
I don't want to talk to my friends. it's a weird place for them.
"it seems like you're climbing the mountain. Everest, I'm afraid."
yes.
you're not equipped with any equipment.
I don't want to lecture them and I don't want it to be like a lecture.
you're worried they're gonna treat you like a kid.
my parents or my friends?
you're talking about your friends.
"yes, I'm going to lecture-- Yes."
you wonder if they're gonna be like kids and you're gonna be like a parent.
"yeah, and I'm not gonna be like that."
you're just talking to your peers.
yes.
you're gonna support them.
I'd like to keep my friends. I'm not gonna- I'm not gonna-
"you're not interested in losing your support group. you're just interested in supporting them, while helping them, raising the baby, and so we're just going to go B. you're not gonna lose them, but maybe the lifestyle they're supposed to be."
"yes, if there's a balance between the worlds, if there's a balance between the worlds,"
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry. you'd like to have both worlds."
yes.
"I'm interested in the friendship and the relationship I have with my friends, but I don't want the party scene."
"yeah, I'm not gonna cut my friends."
"you know, Nina, you know what you're like, and you know what your world looks like, and you know what your family is like, and you know what you're like, and you know what you're like, and you know what you. I really want to support you in making decisions and I want to support you in what I can. I just wonder if you'd like to take a little step, but before we go, I just wonder if you'd like to take a little step."
"yeah, I'm so close to it, I'm sure I'll be fine. well, I'm also, like, I've done it, like, I'm too late?"
"you're worried about your baby's health. I'd like to share with you, Nina, that you have a good day without alcohol, and I'm wondering if it's going to be a good day, and I'm wondering if it's going to be a good day, and I'm wondering"
I'm supposed to do it.
"all right, so you think it's really important. you're gonna make it happen."
yes.
do you want me to support you before we go to the end of the alcohol?
I'm not sure. it's enough to start with just knowing that it's not too late.
you're really taking a look at the reality.
a little bit.
"I'm really glad you've been talking to me today, and I'm really glad you're talking about your heart."
"hello, are you Katie?"
yes.
"hello, I'm Beth. I'm the nurse who's working with Mrs. Smith's nurse. can I talk to you for a minute?"
sure. what's the point of this?
"you've been waiting for Mrs. Smith's birth control prescription, but you've filled out a healthy questionnaire about your habits."
mm-hmm.
-and you've answered some questions about marijuana. do you want to talk about how marijuana plays a role in your life?
sure.
I'm wondering if you're smoking marijuana regularly.
"it's not a big deal in Virginia. I don't have any problems, do I?"
"no, no, no, no. no, no, no, no. not at all. I'm just wondering how you use it and how you use it. do you have any more information about how you use it?"
it's not a big deal. it's just like a couple of times a week.
is marijuana really useful for you to calm down?
"yes. I'm here for a scholarship, so I have to keep my grades up and I'm on the debate team."
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry. you have a lot of responsibilities, and you have a lot of success."
"yeah, I'm sure. I guess I'm a little over my head because I'm the first one in my family to go to college."
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry. you were successful academically and you had a difficult transition to college."
"I've always been a little nervous. I'm just gonna calm down my nerves. I'm in trouble, aren't I?"
"I promise you, you don't have to worry about me."
what are some of the benefits of smoking?
"I guess when I'm with them, I feel like I'm going to fit in with them. it's not possible to explain it any other way."
"well, I'm thinking of something. when you're in a group, you're more comfortable with your friends and more accepted?"
"I'm not sure if I'm more accepted, or if I'm trying to fit in."
how do you help you fit in?
I don't know if it's true.
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry. you don't seem to be more comfortable with your friends smoking pot."
"yeah, I'm sure."
what's the downside to smoking marijuana?
"I'm not sure. I'm nervous, but I'm hoping I'll be caught. if they knew I smoked, they would have killed me."
so smoking pot doesn't help you feel more comfortable with your friends and increase your stress because you're worried about your family and the consequences of your family?
yes.
do you think smoking marijuana has any other negative consequences?
"I'm not gonna have money for it. I'm usually just a little embarrassed to do it to my roommate, but I don't know, it's kind of embarrassing."
so you're also reminded of your financial situation and you don't have any money to spend?
yes.
"it seems to help you relax a little bit, but it also causes you a lot of stress because you try to use it to fit in and that's not helping, you're worried about being caught. what do you think you'd like to do with the pot?"
I'm not sure. it doesn't sound like a good habit.
would you like to suggest something?
"all right, all right, all"
"you've talked about anxiety before, have you ever talked to a therapist about it?"
"no, no, no, no. my family doesn't do that."
can you tell me more about this?
"it's not done, but it's not done. I'm not sure. we don't have money for it, but it's something for crazy people."
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry. so crazy people only want to talk to their family and it's a problem too?"
yes. I'm not sure it's going to happen.
"we know that many kids go to college and they have a lot of stress and anxiety, and we've also found that when they talk to our counselors, they're much better. well, a lot of kids have really benefited from it. I wonder if you'd be helpful to me?"
I'm not sure.
what do you think is the reason for your hesitation?
"I'm not able to pay for it, so my parents won't approve."
"the cost is free, and we provide you with the necessary privacy protection. we're not gonna tell your parents. in particular, if we're concerned about your security, there are some exceptions."
"what, like suicide?"
it's exactly. It's exactly
I'd never do it.
"if you want to know what privacy rules there are, we can talk about it more, but for the most part, you won't have to worry about us."
"all right, all right, all. I'm thinking about it."
"so, if you leave, I'll go with you to the counseling center. I'll introduce you to one of the counselors."
shall I go?
"no, no, no, no. no, no, no, no, no. I'd like to show you where we are and let you know about our resources."
"all right, I'll take it. all right, let's go."
it's all just a little helpless.
you don't know what's going on.
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry. it's all just a little helpless."
looks like you're lost in the direction you want to go.
no one wants to help me.
you're thinking people don't want to help.
no one wants to help me.
you're alone in this.
mm-hmm. I'm really sorry about this. I shouldn't have done it
"you know, you shouldn't have done it."
mm-hmm. I'm really sorry about this. I shouldn't have done it
you feel regretful about what you have done.
mm-hmm. I'm not gonna help myself.
it's something that's just happened.
I'm not gonna help myself.
you're worried you'll lose control of your behavior.
it was a great week.
you had a great week.
it was a great week.
looks like you're really excited about it.
"mm-hmm. I'm not stupid, I know who I'm going to be."
you're definitely capable of making good decisions.
"I'm not stupid, I know who I'm going to be."
"you know, it was helpful to have positive influences on you."
mm-hmm. I'm gonna let the whole family down. they've been so hopeful about me.
you feel like you're letting your family down.
mm-hmm. I'm gonna let my family down. they've been so hopeful about me.
you feel like they've disappointed you.
mm-hmm. I don't want to live like that.
you didn't think this was what you wanted.
I don't want to live like that.
you want to improve on that.
mm-hmm. I'd like to go. I really want to go.
you're not interested in being here.
I'd like to go. I really want to go.
looks like you're following the rules.
mm-hmm. even though I've stopped smoking.
it's something you always think about.
even though I've stopped smoking.
"even though you still want to smoke, it takes a lot of strength."
mm-hmm.
"all right, welcome, Ricky."
thank you. Thank you. Thank you
I'm glad you're here. I'm glad
"you're also here, too."
and you're okay with us?
"yes. yes, yes, yes, yes."
"all right, all right, all"
yes. yes. it's pretty easy to understand -
"yes, yes, yes,"
-I'm always good.
did you ever come here?
"no, no, no, no. no, not at all."
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry. all right, all right, all. all right, all right, all. well, um, I know why you're here today."
yes.
"-um, but it's great to see you, and so maybe it's a good time to start with, tell me why you're here."
"sure. well, I guess, you know, maybe a couple of weeks ago, I was kind of like a group of friends, and um, you know, they-they were saying that it was just like a night. ""well, mm."" I'm like, ""Okay."". I was a little annoyed at first, but then I thought, ""Well, I guess it's not going to hurt."""
"all right, so let's go"
yes.
and that's why you're here today?
yes.
"all right, all right, all"
"yes. I've just been reading a little bit of the internet and stuff, so I just thought I'd check it out."
"all right, so let's go. you thought there was something you needed to look at, something that was bothering you?"
"yeah, I'd say so. I guess I didn't really think about it until they sat down and I thought about it a little bit, so yeah, I thought I'd."
did they care about you?
yes.
"all right, all right, all"
yes. I guess it was a little bit of a shock.
did you think it was a surprise?
"yes. because, you know, I don't know. when people intervene or say, ""You know, you should go and get help,"" you see it on the movie. then. I'm not sure. you know, they need help, you know-"
"yes, I'm sure."
because they're fucked.
mm-hmm.
"""wow. That's a big deal. it's not me, but it's not me. so I'm."
you don't know if it applies to you?
"you know what I mean. like, I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I"
"all right, all right, all"
-if you're interested.
"all right, all right, all"
I guess so.
"I don't understand you yet, something is bothering you and your friends."
yes.
-but you don't know if it's bad or- - but you want to see it?
"yes. yes. yeah, 'cause they're my friends."
mm-hmm.
"- you know, I don't think I'm gonna say for sure that they're completely wrong, 'cause there's a big group of them, you know. so obviously, they're interested, so I'm obviously missing something. ""well, was it really bad?"". ""wasn't that really necessary?"". but I thought I'd take them with a grain of salt and-"
yes.
"-and you'll see, yes."
"because they care about you and you're wondering if something about what they're saying is right, but let's see what it is?"
"yeah, I'm pretty sure."
"all right, all right, all"
yes.
"all right, let's check it out."
"all right, all right, all right,"
"what do you do, what's the concern they're raising?"
I guess Dr. drugs.
mm-hmm.
"yeah, I'm sure. kind of like a little bit of P."
"all right, all right, all"
"-and, uh, I'm a little more likely to smoke a little bit, you know, I smoke a little bit, you know, I'm a little drunk."
"all right, all right, all"
yes.
"what's going on and what it means, and what it's going to be."
maybe a couple of times a week.
"is that what it is, uh, with the drug?"
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes"
you're talking about the meth. a couple of times a week?
"yes, mmm-hmm. yes. you know, it sounds pretty much, but it doesn't feel so much, right. if you're interested, I'll tell you what I mean"
"well, maybe, but also important to-to discuss with you what the effects are and-and what you're concerned about it. but I'll understand you a little better. tell me- tell me what you like about using meth?"
"all right, so let's go. I've been in Auckland for three years, so I'm kind of in the same way as. like, I've been in Auckland for a couple of years."
mm-hmm.
"well, I'm still living in Palmy, so I'm kind of surprised. well, I was introduced to a little bit of a family bar, uh, like, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,"
"yes, I know the family bar."
"yes. I guess it's a gay scene. but then I kind of thought about it and. I didn't really think about it, but I met a lot of people that were kind of like you don't really get there much. you know, I guess you're right, but they don't have them in Auckland bars like that, you know, and I guess in Palmy you can't. you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know. I'm not sure. ""you have to have a car, and you have to wash it, and you have to go to the street."" And I'm like, ""You have to have a car, and you have to go."". you know, I didn't really care about the rugby, but I was interested in the fact that people talked about interesting things and had a good time. I'd like to go dancing and stuff like that. I'm glad I knew about it because I didn't see it before and-and I guess it's a lot of it, you know?"
"most weekends there's a big party. you know, I guess it's just, you know, when I'm. when I'm. when I'm. when I'm. when I'm. when I'm. you know, it's a little bit of a happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy. ""I know I'll be fine."". I guess it's part of it."
"it was like taking charge of something you wanted to do differently in your life, like taking charge of something you wanted to do differently?"
"yes, in a way. although I'd probably not be aware of it. I've just found out about it. I didn't come to Auckland for that."
"all right, so let's go"
"-to escape, um, you know, parents mainly, and that kind of lifestyle, Palmy. well, I've also found something else, uh."
and you've never known about Palmerston?
"no, no, no, no"
"all right, all right, all"
"no, no, no, no. I'm not really sure. you know, I guess you've seen a little bit of that in the movies from America, but you don't really know-"
mm-hmm.
- You think he would be in your country. if you grew up in Palmy.
PALMERSTON. mm-hmm.
"um, I'm not really mean about Palmy, but, you know, it's just a different attitude, I guess."
yes.
-that's what it is.
you seem to be ready for something different.
yes-
and you've come-and you've come-and
-plus-plus-plus-plus
-I'm here in Auckland.
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. I'd definitely want to go somewhere. I've never met anything like that, but then I came here and I found something that was like, it was definitely fate or whatever was pulling me here."
"all right, all right, all"
because I've found something in myself or something I've lost.
and how do you feel about it?
"well, I guess I'm used to it now. ""wow, it's really cool."". it's hard, but it's been three years, so it's kind of like I've gotten used to it."
mm-hmm.
"well, I guess, I guess, I'm, let's say I take it as a given, but, uh, yes, it's fine. well, it's just what I'm doing. I guess the drugs are linked to it. I don't think it's really important, I don't think I've really differentiated it. you know, it's just, ""Okay, I'll go with my friends,"" and that sort of thing. and then it's just a part of it."
"so you came out, you felt--"
"yes, I'm sure."
-being part of the gay culture in Auckland is good-
yes.
-for me?
yes.
and so it's linked to the drug scene with the meth scene?
"yes, I'm sure."
and you don't see where the two things are separate. do they seem to be more often?
"maybe it's not so much, now that I think about it, maybe I didn't notice it."
so - so - so - so
"well, you know, it's something that happens in the weekend, but, you know, sometimes in the week. if I want to do something, I'll have a big night, maybe two, but sometimes, you know, I'll have a big night, you know, on Tuesday or Wednesday or something. I guess it's not really connected to that scene."
"it's just something that worries you about something, but there's no link between the drugs and your life."
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry. maybe. I guess I didn't really think about it."
"all right, all right, all"
-as of recently.
so something's changed recently?
"yes. I guess since I started to take them more seriously, I guess it's just since I've been so generous. and it's-and it's-and"
yes.
-maybe I'll notice something I didn't notice -
tell me about the things you've noticed you've never noticed.
"you know, when you asked me how often."
did you think it was a surprise?
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry. you know, when you're thinking about it, you know, and you don't really think about it, but then when someone asks you, you know, how often or-- and then you have to think about it. it's-it-it's-it"
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
"-it's shocking to hear such a thing. you know, it's not like that, you know, it's not like that, you know, it's not like that. I'm a little pissed off at my friends a little bit, or I don't know, a little defensive. because it sounds great, but it doesn't feel like it. I don't know, I don't know, people who need to go and see a therapist or something. you know, I'm thinking of you. they have a really bad health and they need urgent help, uh, at least that's what you feel. and I'm not really feeling it. it doesn't seem like a very urgent thing. so that's what it is - that"
"all right, all right, all"
-I felt a little weird.
"all right, all right, all"
yes.
"you're a little worried about it, but you don't want to worry about it, but you don't want to worry about it."
yes.
"all right, all right, all"
of course.
what about the good things you do with meth or smoking. isn't it a bad thing. do you have any problems?
"yes, I'm sure. well, uh, uh, uh. I guess money is a big thing. last year, I had a lot more money. I've done a pretty good job, like a, pretty much a regular job."
mm-hmm.
"well, it's a lot of money for the last year. then it wasn't such a problem. I guess I've just a little bit of money. well, I'm not getting much of the income from acting, so I'm not working as much as I used to. I'm kind of like, sometimes I need a little money or a little help with the rent."
"over the last year, a lot has changed -"
yes. yes. a little bit.
it's not like the plan was part of it.
"no, no, no, no. I guess it's a life of actors, but it's not working."
sure. [chuckling] It's not a safe job.
"no, no, no, no"
-and it's hard-and it's hard-and it's
it's not.
-it's hard to do it. but is there any connection between the acting and the use of meth in terms of the effect of meth on your ability to work?
"well, I'm thinking of something. maybe I didn't do so well, but I could have done a couple of auditions."
was the drug affecting the effect?
"maybe. maybe it's just my general state. well, I guess it's a little like, ""What do I do or why do I spend my money?"". it's amazing when it happens."
"well, I'm thinking of something. well, I'm thinking of something"
"I guess I'd save money and go to interesting places, but I guess I'd rather save money and go somewhere interesting. but I'm not sure. I'm wondering if it's gonna have an effect. I don't know. I'm not sure. I don't know, but maybe it's not good for the face. I don't know if I'm tired or-or tired."
"all right, all right, all"
-or if I'm tired or I'm tired. I didn't really think about it -
"all right, all right, all"
-but now I'm thinking about it.
"all right, so let's go. they're also asking questions -"
yes.
-to ask them - to ask them - to ask
yes.
you begin to think about what they might have on you.
yes.
and the choice you might have made.
"yes. well, I'm thinking of something"
"what else. the money-related issues, the choice of money, and the use of money, have taken a lot of money."
"yes, I'm sure."
"-you've been working for a year and maybe even a year ago, and maybe even a year ago, and maybe even a year ago."
"yes, I'm sure."
maybe the effects of your physical appearance. a question about the effect of meth use on the appearance of the body.
mm-hmm.
what-- what-- what-- what-- what-- what-- what-- what. any other things that might be a little bad?
"""you have to-"" you know, they're my friends and my friends, and they're like, ""Look, you have to-"""
yes.
"-look, or else we won't be able to stay here. """
and that's a problem?
"it would be a problem, yes."
why are you telling me this?
"then what do I have, I guess?"
"they're important, they're important."
"yes. yes, and I'm thinking of it, yes. I'm wondering, you know, a lot of friends who've helped me down, they're obviously not part of the scene. they were a couple of them, but mostly they were the ones who were a little bit of a problem. you know, when I started, you know. ""never do it,"" and then you try it, ""Actually, it's not good."". if you're sensible, it won't be the end of the world."
"to die or to be taken to a hospital, you have to take a lot of shit."
I'm thinking of something like that.
"so you don't-- you don't have to be stupid. it's just a little fun, but it's not really explained to people who have their walls. it's hard not to sit in the room, ""Oh, you know, you're really bad."". ""you know what you're talking about."""
"well, I'm thinking of something. Ricky, I just want to check, 'cause I might be wrong, just check with you if you have any friends who are still worried about you. I've heard what you said before, that some of those who were involved in the intervention were using."
"yes, I'm sure. yeah, a couple of them."
you're beginning to ask questions about this use and-and you're beginning to ask questions about it.
yes.
-it's just that we're trying to drill down a little bit to try to pick up what you think might be the best option for you.
"yes, I'm sure."
"because, you know, I picked up from you that it wasn't what it was."
"yes, I'm sure."
I'm happy with that. what if you could change your use- you're on now. what do you think about not changing anything?
"well, I guess it's a big deal about the acting."
"all right, all right, all"
because I'm gonna do it for you. I'm sick of the cafe.
it's going to be your career. it's a career that's going to last
yes.
-you're gonna make it.
"I want it to be, yeah."
"mm-hmm. it's harder to create a career, so you have to work harder. you have to be at the top of the game."
yes.
yes.
"because I mean, it's all you know, it's partially lacking and partially because it's right. if you're in the right place and you're in the right place and you don't have a game, then there's a possibility of."
"yes, and-and maybe that's why meth use is-is compromising."
"yeah, it's possible."
"well, I'm thinking of something"
"you know, I guess it's also linked to money, you know, I've-- I don't have as much money as I used to have."
"all right, so now we're talking about money again."
"of course, I'm not gonna piss my roommate off."
"yes. yeah, I'm sure."
"of course, it's not a good thing to not pay the rent. I don't think I'm happy about it."
that's going to cause problems?
yes.
yes.
"yeah, and I'm not like that person."
"well, let's talk about something else, uh, that we've talked about a little bit before, and it's about your meth use and your gay friends. and that's what you're saying when you're at the party, when you're at the club, when you're with friends who use drugs?"
yes.
the-the availability is there.
yes.
"everyone, most people use it."
"yes. not necessarily P or anything, but a lot of people do something. yes. yeah, it's a different scene, you know, it's a bar, and most people are drunk and wasted and they're just spewing everywhere. people drink, but they don't drink to excess, but they're having a good time. and, yes, and yes."
isn't it hard to be in this scene and not to use drugs?
"yes. there's people who do it. I guess it's going to be hard. I guess I didn't think about it. you know, I only knew it was just like that, 'cause I'm new to it, you know-"
"all right, so let's go"
"-from the beginning, it's always been."
there's a possibility that there's a scene that doesn't rely on drugs.
yes.
-or especially in the use of meth?
"of course, they must be. I guess there's only a majority of people, maybe even a majority of people I know."
"maybe we can look at it later, but if you're interested in what's going on in the gay scene, then it's not a- is not a dominant part of the gay scene."
yes.
"- factor in that partying, and we- where-where there's a gay group that supports people who don't want to be. they have a lifestyle that's heavily influenced by drugs. if you want to think about it, there are some other ideas to consider, for you to think about-"
yes.
"-to think, so it's not about giving up anything, it's not about big changes, it's about how can I improve the situation."
"yes, I'm sure. yes."
I hear you say that you're a little more in control of what I'm doing.
"yes, I'm sure."
so I'm going to try to carry out this plan.
mm-hmm.
what could be the first step?
"when I was a little bit, you know, I was a little bit, you know, when I was saying I, you know, it's pretty much, you know, I've done it a lot. you know, it's not so good on Wednesday."
"so you have to think about it, right?"
yes.
as to what-what-what-what
yes.
what you're gonna do-what you're gonna do
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
-as a substitute.
"yes. you know, but I think it's something to look forward to, because it's a midweek slump. so far, until people arrive where they can-"
yes.
-stay and have a good time.
yes. yes. you have to do something that's gonna work for you.
yes.
"-that's what you really think is important. but if you want to know what they are, you can choose from a couple of options, which if you want to know what they are."
yes.
"because there's a club, there's a group, there's a group, there's a group."
yes.
"but they're not just like the party scene, but other activities. I'm talking about gay groups and gay activities that-"
yes.
"-you know, I'd like to know and-and-and maybe in-- in those options or something, ""Yes, I'd like to try it. look, I'm looking at you. """
"yes. yes, I'm sure."
"I've been introduced to him, so I tried it."
you tried a little bit of drugs with him.
Oxygen.
"you've tried to take a pill. all right, all right, all"
yes.
"all right, all right, all. he's encouraging you to do it."
"yes, he said it was a painkiller."
he said it would help you with the pain you have.
mm-hmm.
yes.
but I'm not doing it as much as I should.
"all right, all right, all. you've been trusting him, and you've tried it, and you've found that it's helped you in some way. what you said was-- it's not just-- you know."
I'm dealing with my grandmother's death.
"all right, so that's helped you."
"yes. I'm alone, and I'm just, I miss her and, it's okay -"
mm-hmm. so it's going to help -
-I'm not gonna have to rely on it.
"all right, all right, all. you don't want to rely on this, you don't want to continue using it. is it something that you found useful at least for the moment?"
"mm-hmm. yes, and -"
"but you don't want to be dependent on it, or dependent?"
"all right, so let's go"
"all right, all right, all right,. so you have a lot of things to do. yes."
"yes, it's true."
"you managed to do the best job you could. you're also a little worried about him, don't you think?"
"well, I don't really know much about it, except that it makes me feel good."
"all right, so now you know it's good for you."
"Tom, it's a pretty painful infection, but we have antibiotics. you'll be cured in ten days, so you'll be cured. can you do it?"
of course.
"can we talk about the form you filled out yesterday, which was about drug use?"
"all right, all right, all"
let's take a look. you've used drugs in a way other than medical reasons. what drugs do you use to treat them?
I'm a little addicted to meth.
"smoke it, smoke it?"
"he's always snorting, always snorting."
don't you want to inject it?
mm-mm.
do you take any other medication?
"well, you know, a little bit of alcohol."
"and, uh, you're doing it so often?"
meth? Is it a meth?
mm-hmm.
"well, two, three times a month."
you're a regular user of meth. you're not using it much?
"all right, so let's go"
isn't it just a snort?
"all right, so let's go"
"as you know, methamphetamine use is associated with a number of health problems. you're in a category we consider a risky user for the amount you use. and that's why people who use Methamphetamine tend to be a lot of problems, and people who use it tend to be a lot of problems. well, actually, one of them is a sexual disease. do you think your meth use may be associated with your STD?"
"well, if I were not high, I wouldn't have done it."
"you're usually very careful about sex, and you're using protection?"
"of course, of course."
do you think you've been clouded by methamphetamine?
yes.
any other drug-related event in your life. does it affect you in any way?
"no, I'm not saying that. well, I'm doing it at the club, you know, at least twice a month, uh, at least twice a month. well, I don't think it's going to have any other impact. but I'm concerned about this one. I've never been infected with gonorrhea."
"yes, I'm also concerned about it, and I'd recommend you stop using Methamphetamine. well, um, but that's my recommendation."
"I-I'm not sure what it would be, but it would be hard for me. I mean, I know I should, but I mean, it's like my whole life. all my friends go to the club. that's where I'm looking. it's basically my sex life and, uh, meth is just a part of it. everyone does it. it's hard to think about it, so it's hard to stop it."
it would be difficult to stop using Methamphetamine if you knew that there were problems associated with it and you also saw that many of your social life and your sex life were involved with Methamphetamine?
"I'm not saying it's not going to be easy, but I'm not saying I'm not willing to try."
"if you're thinking about how you're going to stop using Methamphetamine completely,"
mm-hmm.
"-with zero, he's not ready for anything."
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
"-and you're ready, where do you want to go?"
"well, three, two, one, and"
why not a couple?
"it was really uncomfortable, you know, gonorrhea is a really bad thing. when I'm on it, I know I don't think the same. I'm sick of what I have, I'm sick of AIDS. the same way I could have HIV. it's a big deal to me. that's why it's more than a couple."
do you have any other concerns about Methamphetamine?
"you know, I'm just snorting it, but you don't know what it's like. if something dangerous or dangerous was involved, it could be really bad. I'm a little worried about it sometimes."
"I thought you might have a little interest in not stopping using Methamphetamine, but I guess you have a lot of reasons why you'd like to stop using Methamphetamine. well, you could have HIV, ST-V, or even HIV."
yes.
what would it be easier for you to cut or stop using Methamphetamine?
"you know, you know, you have a different social life on the weekend."
how can you have a different social life?
"it's a tough thing, I mean, almost everyone I know."
does anyone ever use methamphetamine in your life?
my sister's got a sister.
did you talk about the meth?
"I didn't really talk to her about it. I'm sure she knows I'm doing it. we're pretty close. I'd like to talk to her about it, and I think she'd be able to help."
it's difficult to stop using Methamphetamine because there are many positive effects that you can get from using it. but there are reasons to stop using methamphetamine.
"yes, I'm sure."
"you can do things that would make it easier to not use methamphetamine, such as talking to your sister and getting some help."
"yes, I'm sure."
"all right, so, great. I'm not gonna tell you what you do, but you have to do what you want."
"all right, all right, all"
"in a month, I'd see you again. do you think it's going to work?"
sure.
it's good. It's a good. it's been three months since I've been.
"all right, so, so,"
"well, and. and. and. and"
"since the last time you've used meth, right?"
"all right, so let's go"
"all right, all right, all"
"all right, so let's go. I've been doing pretty well for three months."
"all right, all right, all"
"well, I've met a couple of new friends."
"all right, so, so,"
so - so - so - so
"you know, you've been pretty harsh with the ex-boyfriend last time. he's your dealer, so."
"all right, so let's go"
how's it going to be for you?
"all right, so let's go. it was good. It was good. when he called, I didn't answer the phone."
"all right, all right, all"
"I didn't answer the phone a couple of times, and a couple of my friends tried to call me. in the neighborhood I live in, it's good to meet a couple of new people, um, in the neighborhood."
"you seem to have made some good changes. the environment, the behavior, the new friends."
"when I'm stressed out, I use the breathing exercises you taught me, and I'm- I use them when I'm stressed. I'm going to walk, breathe, and relax, and I'm going to calm down."
so it seems to be--
"all right, Catherine, welcome back. I-I remember what you were thinking about last time, you know, I-I remember what you were thinking about last time."
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
what's different this time and what do you think about it?
"as to why I'm here, I'm a little clearer about what I expect."
yes.
"I've been thinking about how much money I've lost lately. so, yeah, so, yeah. I'm happy to be here. [chuckles]"
"all right, all right, all right,. so, this time there's a change?"
mm-hmm.
"yes. yes. I feel like we can work pretty well together. ""you know, I thought, you know, she had a little energy last time."""
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
"so, really, what we're talking about today is-is to talk about what we'd like to do, um, over the next, you know, uh."
mm-hmm.
"last time we talked about how you got into trouble with your family, you mentioned how gambling had gotten you in trouble with your family."
mm-hmm.
"yes. you said something like that last time, you thought it was-- you deserved it and you thought about it, so I'm wondering how open you are."
yes. I'm happy to take a look at it. [chuckles]
yes. yes.
yes.
yes. yes.
yes.
"well, sometimes, when we start opening things up, and then you think, ""Oh, it's a little uncomfortable."". how do you deal with it when you're uncomfortable. how did you do it in the past?"
"well, I'm thinking of something. I'm probably gonna lock it up a little. [chuckles]"
yes. yes. how do I know if we're talking and you're blocking. what would you say to our session?
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. I'm sure you've noticed. I'm sure he's fidgeting."
yeah?
that's why I'm still a little.
"all right, that's okay."
[chuckles]
"you know, maybe it would be useful, you know, so, like, you know, maybe I'll miss it. it would be very helpful if you could tell me something."
when I'm uncomfortable with you?
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. that would be really helpful if you could say, ""Ken, hello, I'm starting to, you know, I'm starting to get a little uncomfortable."""
"all right, all right, all"
yeah?
mm-hmm.
"all right, thanks. you said you got a buzz last time, and you said you were gambling, and you seemed like you were gambling."
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
"so, um, how serious are you about this?"
I guess it's really serious if I want to get out of debt.
"all right, all right, all right,"
"my ears are out of my ears, and my father and mom don't want to help me."
yes.
-I guess I have to do it myself.
"all right, all right, all. how serious - how important is it to sort it out. yes."
it's about 80. [chuckles]
"about 80. all right, all right, all right, all right, all. and then, you know, how confident are you that you can, you know, you can actually do it?"
"I'll tell you, I'm completely confident."
yeah. but what would you say to that?
"yes, I'm sure."
-you're going to be on a scale of 1 to 100. where's your confidence going to be?
what if I'm confident I'll stop. [chuckles]
"all right, so we'll get it sorted. not necessarily to stop. but I don't know if it's the right answer, but I'm not sure if it's the right answer."
"it's hard when you live it, right?"
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
"last night when I went to the pub with my friends, I was a little nervous."
"well, I'm thinking of something"
"-well, I'm a little weird if I'm sitting at the bar alone. [chuckles]"
yes. you've been fluttering around them all night?
yes.
"yes, I'm sure. all right, all right, all right,. and-and when they stopped fluttering, did you stop fluttering. where-where's the point of this-where-where"
I've been halfway through it because I ran out of money. [chuckles]
"all right, all right, all. all right, all right, all. all right, all right, all. yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. you've said before, you know, you couldn't afford it."
mm-hmm.
"because you've owed your parents money, and they didn't bail you out, and you had to go out and find some money?"
yes.
"yeah. yes. yes, I'm sure. you know, you seem to be behaving, you know, still creating problems?"
mm-hmm.
yeah. yes.
yes.
"when you think about it, you feel something?"
"I'm not sure, but I'd like to go back to the way, but."
yes.
I don't really want to spend my life in debt. [chuckles]
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
"I'm traveling, and I have friends who saved money and I'm 25, and I'm working in retail."
yes.
-so I'm not going to travel any time soon.
"all right, all right, all. so, again, it's very important. so what do you dream about. what's your dream about. when do you want to be. where's the Catherine gonna be. what do you want to do. what's your dream about?"
maybe I'd like to go and find my dream man. [chuckles]
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes"
"I'm not sure. maybe kids, but they're not kids."
"all right, all right, all"
"I don't want to be a good mom, at the moment, do I. so I'm probably going to have to go somewhere. [chuckles] I'll be 30 and I'll still be in debt."
"all right, all right, all right,. you seem to be in a state of thinking about your next steps."
yes.
"yeah. yes. ""you know, I'm still on my current lifestyle,"" and you're a party girl you used to be - I was talking to last time."
[chuckles]
"-wasn't that-- Is that what you mean. yeah. ""do I live a party lifestyle - a party girl's lifestyle, or am I going to have a different dream?"". so, it's a tough call. and-and it's all - and there's no three ways. we'll have to call them at some point."
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
"and, my sense, you're facing a challenge right now. yeah?"
yes.
"what position do you want to be in five years. which is the best. you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,. what's the best direction to go?"
it's a little sad for a 30-year-old party girl. [chuckles]
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure. it's been a great ride so far.
what do you think is your guess. yes.
"-but I'd like to go, so."
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. where's the best place to be. you have any ideas about what you want to do."
"Egyptian, I've always been."
Egyptian?
yes.
"what about Egypt, what about it?"
it's just fascinating to me.
yeah?
"yes. the outlook, the culture and the history and-"
"oh, my God."
-I've always wanted to go somewhere.
yes.
"but at the moment, it's not the safest place."
"no, it's true."
yes.
"of course, of course, of course, of"
"yes, I'm sure."
maybe it's different.
mm-hmm.
"yes. all right, so you've had this idea for a long time-you wanted to do it and you wanted to go?"
I've been young since I was a kid.
"yeah, I'm sure."
yes.
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry. how much of this dream, you know, is it taking away from your current lifestyle?"
"I'd probably go back to Egypt five times in five years, and I'd probably go back to Egypt five times. [chuckles]"
"yes. yeah, I'm sure."
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
"all right, let's go. Let's. so you have to make some decisions about what dream, what path you want to go."
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
"well, I'm thinking of something. what's the hardest part of the journey to-to travel and realize the dream. what would you have to deal with?"
"then I'm going to cut my friendship. because you know, it's part of their lifestyle."
yes.
yes. it's going to be a big change.
"mm-hmm, mm-hmm. you've been thinking about this for a minute. so how far are you from the change. because obviously, it's not going to be, but how far away are you from it?"
"it seems a little unrealistic. well, I want to take the first step, but it's going to be easy."
"no, no, no, no, no. it's going to be easy. what's the first step to the first step?"
"I guess, um, I guess I'm going to try to cut the credit card, and try to keep my head out of it, and not to be tempted."
"all right, all right, all"
"if the pokies are in the pub, don't go to the pub. [chuckles]"
"it's hard, isn't it. being in the pub is hard."
mm-hmm.
"I guess we'll have an illustration. we're calling these high-risk situations. you know, it's like. so you might learn a little bit of a language about what we're talking about-"
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry. [chuckles]"
"you know, you know, you're at the pub, you know, you want to go to the casino, you know, you want to go to the game, you know, you want to go to the game, you know, you want to. yeah?"
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
yeah. how do you think you might handle this today?
"I didn't do it, so I don't know."
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
I guess I'll have to deal with myself.
"yes. you know, people often say it, but, you know, it's not really difficult, but you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you"
what's the matter with you. isn't it a friendship that I'm cutting?
"well, it's a couple of ideas. O-one, you're thinking about who your friends are and who will support you to travel to Egypt."
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
"in fact, you've been talking about cutting your credit cards before. it's really amazing what the cards make on the other side."
mm-hmm.
"it's very helpful and healthy. so, you have a lot of good ideas, right?"
mm-hmm.
yes. so that's what we're working on. yeah. yeah?
yes.
"because I asked you before, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,"
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,. maybe some of your friends are moving around the same things as you, wondering where they're going."
mm-hmm.
"-what's the point of their dreams, right?"
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry. yes."
"all right, so we talked about what you might be in five years, what you want to do, yep, yep. you're very clear about it."
mm-hmm.
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. we can do it in a couple of minutes, but we can do it in a minute."
yes.
yes. what can we do in the next meeting?
find the scissors. [laughing]
"all right, let's find the scissors."
cut the girls off.
"yes, yes, yes, yes."
"well, I don't know if the debt is still there or not, but I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I"
yes.
-to pay them off and pay them off.
"really, really, really, really,"
-I'm not sure how I'm gonna do it.
"yes. all right, so it seems like a good budget for buying things."
mm-hmm.
"there's a great service here, and you can get a great service, and something that you can do."
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
so let's talk about how we're gonna organize a meeting with them.
it's going to be good.
"all right, all right, all"
yes.
what else would you do to me?
they found a little bag of weed.
mm-hmm.
it's not much of a thing.
mm-hmm.
I didn't want to sell him. it's like - like - like - like
just enough to be useful?
"yes, whatever, you know. it's California, no one cares about it."
yes. yes. yes.
how long will it take?
"we'll talk for about 15 to 20 minutes. well, it's definitely the first session we'll be together for the next six months. of course, you'd want to know how much time it will take. what else would you like to tell me about your perspective that you think will help me with you?"
I'm just gonna do what I need.
"all right, all right, all. you're more focused on what you're supposed to do to get rid of it?"
"yes, yes, yes,"
"all right, mm-hmm. if you want, I'd like to ask you if you'd like to share some ideas with us as we work together, um, so we can share them with you, um, as we're working together, so we can share them with you. would it be a natural time to move to the point where we might be able to move together?"
"you know, you have a dream, which sounds like it, and you have a partner, and a house, and a nice car."
yes.
"remember, the car, the kids, and the good dad."
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes"
"-to your kids, your kids. so, is this dream starting to--"
"yes, it would be good."
"yes. all right, all right, all. so, what I really want to know is how the picture fits into the dream."
I guess it's not.
"all right, how about it, Billy?"
I guess I'll go back and I'll go to court.
yeah?
yes. it's a little bit of a mess.
"yes. it's kind of a dream, right?"
yes. it's going to be harder.
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry. is it harder to do this. yes. it's going to be harder to keep a job, right?"
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
and it's harder to do it -
it's hard to get a job because you have to say you've done prison time.
yes.
yes.
we talked about the idea of you getting a job and something about cars.
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
yeah. what do you think you might do about what you've been thinking about since we last met?
"I'm not sure if I'd go to polytech, or something."
mm-hmm.
yes. as if they had jobs.
"all right, so you know some people?"
yes.
"you went through a similar path, and you went to school, and you tried to go."
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes"
-to get a degree?
yes.
yeah. so what do you think about going down the same path?
"learn more about cars and, you know, you're kind of hands-on."
"mm-hmm. well, what exactly. what would you do if you wanted to do something like that?"
"[sighs] Mechanic, or panel, or just-- I'm not interested, I'm just-- as long as it's cars."
mm-hmm. would you like to be nice to him if he's just about cars?
"yes, pretty much."
yeah?
yes.
"all right, all right, all. what do you think you'll need to do to get the qualification?"
"I guess I'll have to go to the training, and then I'm probably going to work."
mm-hmm.
yes.
"all right, all right, all. what did they do to you, what did they do to you?"
"kind of like, um, just in polytech. I don't know what exactly, but."
mm-hmm.
"they've been in apprenticeship for a year, and then they went to school."
mm-hmm.
yes.
"yes. so, how confident are you that you'd be able to do something like that-these friends you have?"
yes. it's going to be easy for me. I'm sure I know everything.
"all right, all right, all. so, it's going to be easy. what do you do if it's easy?"
"well, I went out and picked up some forms and stuff, but it's really confusing, like, I'm trying to apply, but I don't know. I'm not going to do it."
"all right, all right, all. you've actually been to Polytech -"
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes"
-and you've picked up some forms?
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. he passed it around and everything."
"wow, that's really cool."
yes.
"that's great, Billy."
"yeah, but I'm not gonna help them, so-"
"all right, all right, all"
-I'm in the form and-
tell me what happened when you said it wasn't helpful. what-what-what happened?
"I'm asking what I have to do, and they say I have to fill out some forms."
yes.
"-well, it's too much of a mess."
"all right, all right, all. so you've got a bunch of forms for the course?"
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. I'm on the panel, and I have a picture of the painting, and I have a picture of the painting."
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
"-so, you learn how to paint cars."
yes.
yes.
"all right, all right, all. you've got the forms, you took them home?"
"yes. I'd like to fill them up, but then I didn't, so I took them home, but I'd like to help Donna."
mm-hmm. did you say the forms were confusing?
yes.
yeah. what's the confusing part?
"I'm not sure what you're supposed to write. as a matter of fact, yes. I don't know how to do it, maybe too confusing."
yes. how do you feel about writing things or filling out forms?
I'm not really interested in it. I'm not really interested in writing.
you're not writing anymore?
"no, no, no, no"
"yes. then I wonder what it's about, not really liking writing."
"no, I'm really messy, so people don't read it."
people don't read. people don't read your handwriting?
"yes, no. they say it's what they're saying."
you're probably a doctor.
"yes, I'm here. [chuckles]"
yeah. [chuckles] Yeah?
yes.
"all right, all right, all. so, you're gonna help fill the forms?"
"yes. like a computer, or something. I could write on the computer."
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
but we don't have a computer.
"all right, all right, all. all right, so what do you have to do to actually get there, Billy?"
"I guess I'll ask someone else. I'd like to ask Donna, but it's embarrassing."
"all right, so you're thinking about how embarrassing it would be to ask Donna to help you."
yes.
-because you're afraid she might find something you don't want her to find out?
"well, I'm not sure if it's serious, but it's-"
"all right, all right, all"
"-I'm sure most people will be able to fill them. I'm not sure, but I'm not sure."
"well, I'm thinking of something. so who else would you ask?"
"no one, no one, no one. I'm guessing you're right. you'd be able to do it. would you do it to me?"
you have the forms?
"no, no, no, no"
"all right, all right, all. I wonder if this idea of filling out the forms, which seems to be a big dream, is going to be a problem for you."
yes.
"-and you're on this road where you're staying out of trouble, uh, you have a."
yes.
"-you're gonna do it. it's a shame that the forms are going to be so bad, so we have to find a way to get around them."
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
"yeah. so, what do you think you can do next week?"
"I guess I'd go and I guess I'd ask Donna, but I guess I'd ask her."
"you'd probably help her, but you don't want to. you seem a little embarrassed."
"well, I'm not sure. besides, I'm not sure if I'd be able to go to Polytec by 9: 00 every morning. I used to sleep in."
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
on the night of the night.
"so, the whole thing about going back to school."
yes.
"-you know, it's going to be a big change in how you live, and you don't know if you can do it."
"yes. it's going to be a school. well, I'm not really enjoying school. I don't want to write, and I don't want to do it. it would be good if it was all hands."
"yes. it seems like you're in the way because you have something about your level of confidence or confidence, which seems to be a problem."
"yes. no, it's going to be a problem. I'm not interested in it."
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry. all right, all right, all"
it's a waste of time.
"all right, let's go. Let. so, it seems like we'll have to talk about it more."
yes.
so what's the problem?
what's the point?
"well, the writing business. what's really going on?"
"what's the matter with what. well, I'm not going to get it."
"I wonder if you're saying something like that, like--"
yes. I'm not going to be able to.
-so I'm wondering where you're writing and reading?
"I don't know, I'm not retarded, but I don't know, I'm not crazy. I'm writing and reading."
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
yes.
yes. I'm sure you don't have any retard.
as-- as-- as-- as
[chuckles]
yes.
we're really good at this conversation.
yes.
you don't have a strong point to read and write.
"no, I don't think so. yeah, I'm not really enjoying it."
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
yes.
how much reading and writing do you have to do?
"I'm not sure. I guess not much, but that's what I'm looking for."
so what if you were more confident about your reading and writing. what would it be like?
it would be simpler for everything.
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
"like. I don't really like reading, so I'm not really interested in it, but I'm interested in real life things like going to the bank."
mm-hmm.
"-Yes, it's filling out the forms."
yes.
yes.
"and, I'm guessing there's a manual and stuff like that."
yes.
"-you know, you know, you're really confident about what you're doing, but it's more reading, writing, book, kind of."
"yeah, I've never thought about it."
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
"it would be a shame if you read a big manual. well, I'm thinking of something"
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry. all right, all right, all. so you know, like before you've got this dream, there's something you should do before it happens."
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
"yes. so, mm, we have to think about what's the first step."
so you're sick of it?
"yes. I'm not gonna shoplift anymore. I've been caught again. if I don't stop it, I'm gonna be suspended, I'm going to school, so I'm. I'm gonna be a fool."
mm-hmm.
"yes, it's bad. we just. we're having a good time, and I don't know what to do, but I- I have to change."
"all right, all right, all"
I'd like to have it.
"so, you seem to be ready. you want to give it up."
yes.
but it's not so clear how to go about it.
"all right, so let's go. I'm not sure what I'm gonna do, but I have a couple of friends. they're bad news, but they're my friends."
mm-hmm.
"well, uh, and it's fun."
"it's fun, and it's fun."
"you know, I'm thinking of you"
mm-hmm.
"it's not much fun. we're going in, we're stealing the CDs. it's working, but."
uh-huh.
thank you for coming. I guess you've been sitting in the same seat with a lot of people.
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
"yes. you've got some ideas and some experiences. I'd like to know what you think about what you might want to change in your life, 'cause we're gonna work together."
"all right, so let's go. it's a nice thing. It's. what, um, what have I changed, what."
"what you've been thinking about, um, the last few months. because I've noticed you've been."
I thought about how easy it would be to deal with P.
yes.
how I could actually do it the wrong way.
"sure. you know, I'm picking up a life that you know a lot about."
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
"you'll make money and you'll be fine. I guess when I'm talking to guys like you who've done time, they often think about life, maybe life can be different. I wonder where you're thinking about-where you're thinking about-"
"I had a little bit of a buzz last week, okay, what's next. well, it's not going to work out."
"all right, all right, all"
I don't know what it is.
sure. life on the outside is very different from what life is like on the inside.
"yes, I'm sure."
-is there anything about the inside of life?
"yes, it's worse."
yeah?
yes.
so tell me how you're doing. because I'm not sure if you'd come back. how you doing-to-to-to-to-to-to-
"I'm not yet, I mean-"
"all right, all right, all"
-the offer is there.
yeah?
"I'm not saying I'll do it, but I mean-"
"uh, tell me-"
-it's here.
you have a lot of contacts?
yes.
"you were in the system, so you know what it's like. you don't have a new challenge."
"no, no, no, no"
how long have you been out?
how long have I been out?
yes.
we'll be there in three weeks.
"it's been three weeks, right?"
we'll be there in three weeks.
then what was it. what did you do for three weeks?
I'm not sure.
you've actually decided not to pick up your old life and continue to live.
"you know, before I left, I thought about it a little bit. then I'm just kind of with it and I don't really know why. [clears throat] I don't know, if, uh, I don't know, if I don't. if I do it again, I'll go like, whatever, if I do it, I'll go like, whatever, if I do it. it's going to be a long one."
"all right, all right, all"
I'm not going back there. I don't think I'll go back there.
"all right, so let's go. so you know, you can sit down and take a risk, but you know, it's not going to last?"
"no, never will."
"it's never going to last. I'm sorry, but I'm sorry. I don't think you're a very good place for me."
"yes, I'm sure. I've been in a crossroads for 12 years."
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry. but there were times when the crossroads were more focused than others."
yes. and- [crosstalk]
yes. maybe it's like that-
"-kind of a different, yes."
yes.
"we're at the end, you know, and I guess it's actually happening."
yes.
but I'm not sure. it's quite clear that no idea doesn't mean anything.
"all right, all right, all. all right, all right, all. so - so - so - so"
do you have any idea what I'm talking about?
"no, no, no, no. well, I-I have a lot of ideas, but I'm really interested in hearing your ideas first."
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
"you have committed to 22 days of drug-free. I didn't go back to the lifestyle. what-what's keeping you, 'cause you're at the crossroads. I don't know about the other one. what's keeping you here?"
"Fiona, what do you mean?"
yeah?
yes.
tell me about Fiona's life?
"she said it's over if I'm doing it. I mean, she's with me, what do you say. she stayed through the shit. I'm sorry about her - I owe her to"
"all right, all right, all"
"something, something, something, something,"
"all right, all right, all. how long have you been with Fiona?"
it's been 12 years since I've
"it's been 12 years since I've. all right, all right, all. she stood by you for a moment, but this time she said, it's going to happen again?"
yes. now she's got a black and white line.
"all right, all right, all. you seem to be listening to the black and white line."
she could be quite full-on.
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes"
"yes, it's hard to ignore that line."
yes.
"well, I mean, I'm thinking. she's never been like that, and she's got a lot of rules."
"all right, all right, all. so you've changed your relationship, right?"
yes. I'm sure she's got it. I'm not sure I'd have it.
"all right, all right, all. what do you want Fiona to do?"
she's just looking for me. she just wants someone to come. I'm here. I'm here. she's remembering me and she wants to.
"he's looking for him. He wants him. then what do you want to do with him, Daryl?"
the one who's gonna be the one who's gonna be
she wanted to- she wanted to love him and see great things?
"yes, that's the one."
or is he just looking for the one who keeps getting in trouble?
"no, no, no, no, no. no one would want him. I'm not interested in him. he's a fool, isn't he. she's looking for the one she loved."
"all right, all right, all"
yes.
what will it take to regain the love of Daryl?
I'd be sitting here if I had an answer.
"sure, sure."
"I'm really honest with you, I don't know. I'm not sure. I-I'd like to know where I could start, but I can't. I don't know. I'm not sure."
"all right, let's go. Let. all right, let's just play with this idea a little bit, Daryl. what did Fiona fall in love with. what did Daryl say, ""This is him""?"
"I'm really romantic. I'm really romantic. well, I was pretty good, and, uh, you know, I've been really good, and she loved it. we've been laughing at you, you know. ""oh, my God, you two,"" they said. you're just lucky, you two, aren't you. we've lost him, so what she wants is what we've lost. we were young, but we were young. how do you get young. I'm old, and we'll keep growing old, but you know?"
I'm sure.
as if I didn't take care of it.
"sure. everyone will be old, but it will be fine."
of course.
"well, that's okay. she fell in love with it, the fun, the sense of Daryl, and everything changed, but she's still with you?"
yes.
yeah?
yes.
yes. and you still have her?
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,"
"yes. so talk to Fiona about the crossroads you're in. you haven't been back in 22 days, you're not back. you'll probably be able to handle it easily tomorrow and you'll probably be able to do some work."
"you know what. she didn't even talk about the deal, she didn't even talk about it. it's like she's black and white. she's- she's offering suggestions, you know. I can do it, but I don't really want to, but I'm really happy to do it. I started to be a little sympathetic to her, but like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm"
"all right, all right, all. all right, let's go. Let. so you're starting to get a little tense at home, and your relationship is a little tense?"
"a little bit of that. yes, a little tense. yes, it's true."
yes. don't tell me the words. if that's true - I'm sure it's true.
"no, they're right."
"yeah, I'm sure. yeah?"
"it's not like we started on the new path, but I mean, it's tense."
"second, I'd like to talk about this whole idea, that's the idea of a crossroad, right. you have a 12-year history of being in the other system, but you've been away for a while, but you're back, sitting down, and you have a choice. in that 'where to go', what ideas have you had about where the Daryl, non-dealing guy -"
"well, I'm not sure. I'm not going to the nuggets. I just feel like I should go somewhere."
"all right, all right, all. yes, I'm sure. you know you have to go somewhere else, but the direction doesn't seem to be clear?"
yes.
he's picking up the phone?
yes. I don't know. I'm not
"I don't know. I'm not. all right, all right, all. I wonder if you've been in the system for a while. you're 34, right?"
[nods].
"yes. so, you know, a lot of guys start thinking about what's important to them at 34. you'd be a guy, so they would have made some changes and thought, ""Time to move on."""
"yes. all right, um - - - - -"
and now you have - - - - - - -
"not many, but a lot of people"
not much?
mm-hmm.
but some of them.
"well, I have. yes, one. [chuckles]"
one?
"one, two, three, four"
yes.
"yeah, I'm sure."
yeah?
"all right, so, um."
tell me something about it.
"the first time I was inside, he was with me, and now he's a drug counselor."
"all right, all right, all"
"so, he's- he's done it."
he's done it?
"he didn't really have a problem with addiction, but he was just. he's very good with people."
yes.
"he talks really well, but I don't know how he does it."
"all right, let's go. how much information would you like to know about how he did it. because I think you know someone, you've done it with me, you've had a relationship."
"well, I'm not a drug counselor."
"no, I don't mean you-- No, not about being a drug counselor, but about he's done it from-to being involved in crime."
yes.
-to move to a different place.
yes. he would have found a higher power. they'll find one of them.
"all right, no idea of a higher power?"
yes.
"so it's going to work for him, but what about you?"
I'm not sure. that's why I'm here.
sure.
I'm not sure what it is.
"well, we'll try to find out what we can do with us and the work we might do."
"all right, all right, all"
-thing. whatever it is.
good luck.
"it's a search, right?"
"no, I'm not saying anything rude."
"no, no, no, no"
-but it's a big ask.
"yes, it's a big ask. what qualities do you need to have?"
that's fucking guts.
guts. yeah?
is it a quality?
I'm sure it's true.
"yeah, I'd have to have some of them."
"yeah. so you're a guy, Daryl, who's got guts?"
I'm. I'm. I'm
yes.
"no, not yet."
"not yet, but I'm sure it"
"no, I'm not."
yeah?
"no, I'm not so brave."
but you sit here with me today.
I'm supposed to.
-and-and you're talking about something.
yes.
you sit here and you talk to me.
"all right, all right, all right,"
-about things that are-that's quite deep
yes.
"-in a way, it's a little bit. well, that's a tough thing to do. that's what courage is."
"all right, let's go. Let"
"in my view, it's true."
"all right, all right, all"
because you could have said something like that.
it's a little awkward.
"-look, Ken, I'm coming in, I'll report, I'm gone."
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. I'd be able to do it."
"you could have done it, but you didn't. so I'm wondering what's different about it. because I don't know, Daryl, you might have done it with someone like me, but-but I'm thinking something different this time."
"I'm older, you know. it's not as much fun as it seems."
yeah?
I've been taking you guys out of my mouth.
yes.
"-all day, every day. we're all doing it, but-"
sure.
"-it's not a joke. I mean, you're a good guy. in fact, you're not worthy of my shit. I'm just. I don't know. good luck."
"when you think about it, I feel a little sadness."
"sadness. I'm not gonna be a fool, you know. you have to take advantage of your life, don't you?"
yes.
I've never done it.
"all right, all right, all. all the time, opportunities come and go."
do they really?
they're doing it.
"all right, let's go. Let. I don't care about you."
you've said before you've had an opportunity to pick up and start again.
"yes, I'm sure. there's a lot of opportunities for them."
and-and so-and so-and so I wonder what might be difficult to see opportunities in a different world?
"well, I don't have any opportunities in the world. I have a shift, minimum wage, and nothing. so, you know, you set up, you set your goal, or, um, you don't, and that's your-your old habits."
"sure, sure. you're in the system, you're in the system"
mm-hmm.
-you don't belong to the system. where do you want to go?
the system's system?
what happens if you start again?
"I fought the system, man."
yes.
-and I'll only be back to the inside-
"all right, all right, all right,"
-I'm thinking of. -I mean
"you said it doesn't look good in the other world, and I'm wondering if it's not too much of a good thing."
"well, I'm not going to see him."
you're not gonna tell me?
if I knew what they looked like-
yeah?
"-you know, I might be able to buy it."
yeah. you've just told me how it looked like a minute ago.
I'm supposed to?
the minimum wage is the minimum wage.
yes.
"-night shift, the gas station."
it's not much fun. it's not very good.
yeah?
it's really hard to do this.
yeah. it's really hard to do this.
I'm sure it's the right thing.
sure.
"it's going to work, you're going to work, you're going home, you're cooking, you're taking care of your kids. it really means something, but I don't have it."
"sure. you know, before we talked about courage, you were talking about it with me and you had guts to talk about it. I don't mean that you should go to minimum wage, but-but the guts to actually start to go to the other world. I'm wondering if you're-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I"
maybe.
"maybe. I understand you don't believe it, but."
"no, no, no, no. you know, I'd like to be convinced."
sure. it's hard to convince you-
"all right, so let's go"
"because it's your life and your life is yours, and you have to live it. I'm just walking my way. but I'm trying to think about what I'd like to do if I were you, 'cause I don't want to fall in love with you and fall into a life of crime. I hear you have a relationship with your relationship, and I'm sure you have a clear idea of the bottom line."
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
"so what will push this direction, just a little bit of the balance to give the other world of the world. it's new, so it's different. it's really boring, really boring things."
"it's just a little thing, like waking up, and having a cup of tea and sitting on the porch."
it's a little bit of a surprise?
yes.
not on the wire?
"no, you're not allowed to sit out there."
no?
-on the porch.
you're not. who's sitting on the porch with you?
"no one, no one, no one. it's morning, I'm alone."
mm-hmm.
"birds, trees, you know, you're just saying."
"all right, let's go. so you can be your own man in this world?"
maybe.
maybe?
"you know, that was nice. sure, but you know, eventually you have to go to work and-"
yeah?
"pay your wages, I mean your mortgage and-and-and"
yes.
-it's a big deal.
"yes, it's true. it's true. It's true."
it's true. It's true.
"it's huge, absolutely huge. so, uh-- so, you have a challenge, right. because I hear it's true -"
"but people like me are rejected in this world. you know, I'm thinking of you. I don't have the qualifications. I work in Australia for 160,000 a year, you know. just digging holes for men. yeah, if I could, yeah, but I'm out of jail, so I don't have any NCEA. I've had a chance, and I've fucked it because I'm lazy. you know, I'm thinking of you. maybe the world is giving me opportunities, but I don't need them. maybe I'm not able to."
sure. I hear you don't believe it.
"no, I'm not sure."
"no, no, no, no. what would you do to make this change. because I hear a lot of. And then once you have a record, I know, you know, I know. it's not easy, but it's not easy. you can't just wonder about work, a high-paying job and go, ""Pick me, pick me."". I'm sure."
"no, no, no, no"
"you know, I'm thinking of that."
"yes, I'm sure."
"so, um. and maybe it's just a little step."
"yes. of course, it's definitely, it's definitely, but what is it. what is the first step to the social life?"
"you're trying to get a job, maybe you'll be able to do it."
"I'm just saying if I'm not working, I'm not gonna do it."
"all right, all right, all"
"I'll make what I can in an hour, or a week. it's pretty much like what you're doing if you don't?"
"yes. but you say, ""Yes, I'd be able to do what you do in a week,"" but you don't. 22-22 days-22-22 days-"
yes.
-and you're not doing it. so tell me what's going on.
"""you won't"" this time, I thought, and then Fiona said, ""You won't."""
"you've been thinking about it, so you're like, you're like, you're like a guy who's gonna make a decision, you're stubborn?"
"even if it's not the right one, yes."
it's not a question of whether it's right or wrong.
"yeah, but I'm a guy."
"you're a pretty good guy, so you'll make a decision. you've decided you won't be able to deal with it?"
"I didn't make a decision, I just said, ""I'm not yet."""
"still, it's true that it"
"yes, I've said it."
you keep the door open.
yes.
-I'm picking up what I'm picking up.
I'm not happy about that.
"all right, so you have to call you."
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
"I don't- I don't want to call you. you'll call, but there's a consequence of making that call, and there's a big consequence of not being there. and what I'm picking up is a call to do something that's not sexy and exciting and in the big money, but I'm with Fiona and I'm doing it."
"yeah, I'm sure."
yes.
we don't get closer.
"no, no, no, no"
"but yes, it's true."
but we're talking about it.
yes.
how long have you been talking about this?
"oh, shit."
- Position? - Position? - Position
with anyone else than Fiona. I'd say it's about ten hours.
"all right, so it's kind of interesting that we're talking about it?"
yes.
"I want to summarize, Daryl, what I've picked up so far and then I'll be really careful to listen to you, right. because, you know, it's important to listen to you."
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
-by the people I know. I'm picking up-I'm picking up-I'm picking up-I'm picking up-I'm picking up-I'm picking up-I'm picking up-I'm picking up-I'm picking up-I'm picking up-I
"yes, 12, almost 13."
"so and so and so, so and so, so and so, so and so, so and so, so and so, so and so, so and so, so and so, so and so, so and so, so and so, so"
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
"you know, when we talk about, you know, doing things, doing the things that everyone else does, you know, it's going to be, you know, it's going to be, you know, it's going to be, you know"
it seems pretty exciting.
"well, it's true, is it?"
"it's true, because it's so different."
"all right, all right, all right,"
and I'm pretty much done with that.
"all right, you've done it, you've done it. so, let's start thinking about what might be the first step."
yes.
"yeah, I think you're going to have a big climb."
"all right, I'll take a look."
"yes, you know, before you've had a friend who turned his back on the offense."
yes.
you've been wondering about the 12-step stuff that works for him.
"yes-yes, it's working for him."
"maybe, I wonder if he's actually doing it, and how he's staying out of it, 'cause like-like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like"
"oh, yeah, I'm gonna call him."
he's got a ring on him?
"yeah, I'm sure."
"yes. I'm a little surprised, I'm wondering, surprised face."
"we were inside a long time ago. I'm sure he's doing it. it's a little weird, but he'd probably be fine with it."
so you're gonna call me?
the possibility of calling yes.
"yes, it's possible."
yes.
"all right, and Fiona was pretty firm."
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
someone who really knows where you want to go as a couple.
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
-I'm sure it's a sense.
yes.
yes.
I'm just doing what I'm told. I'm not sure.
"yeah, but I'm picking up, she's got some hopes."
"yeah, I've been, uh, I mean, I've been, uh, I mean, I've been, uh, I mean, I've been"
what will you do to start thinking about her hopes and sharing her hopes?
"you know, it's pretty scary stuff, you know, but I mean, it's pretty scary."
yeah?
yes. I'd never admit it.
you've said you're a guy who's pretty firm on your decision once you've made it.
yes.
"if you decide to go, it's going to be scary, but it's important, it's important, it's important, it's important, it's important, it's important, it's important, it's important, it's important, it"
"yeah, but I've been very clear about what I've decided to do, and I know I know what I'm thinking. I really need to know what I'm gonna do. you know, not just to talk about it."
sure.
"-what's the plan to call you and tell you, hey, bro, hey, bro, uh, how did you do it. really. is it - - - - - -"
yes. that's what I think it is. I wonder if this is the path that starts with a different decision. I'm wondering if you'd have any wisdom about what it's like to walk this way.
"yeah, I guess I'd be wondering too."
"it's hard work in this place, I thought."
"well, I'm thinking of something"
it's a pretty lonely walk. I wonder who else might be able to walk with you?
"there's Fiona, and she's here."
yes.
"[unintelligible 00:26:37] What he did. dad's just as bad as he is. there's Fiona, and she's here."
maybe they'll go with you too.
"all right, all right, all right. all right, let's go. Let"
there's a couple of people.
yes.
if you want to do it. you have to call me.
what's the point of today?
"I'm not sure. you know, I have a little trouble with my criminal history and, uh, you know, I'm trying to stay on the right path, but, you know, it's just a little bit of trouble. you know, I really want to be a productive member of society, but at the same time, I'm aware of the fact that no one will overlook me. it's really frustrating, you know, so I'm going to go back to what I know. you know, it's causing a lot of anger and depression, and, uh, you know, I don't want to fall back."
it's really hard to become what you want.
"yes, it's true."
yes. so what about your criminal record?
"I'm not sure what it is, um."
you have a conviction on your record?
yes. he's got a conviction for a felony.
"all right, all right, all. oh, my God, it's-"
"well, uh - and, uh - and"
-the biggest problem is that there's a problem. yes.
"yes, it's true. ""all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right,. I won't be in jail."
mm-hmm.
"well, it's more like a life sentence than a four-year sentence. you know, I mean, I thought it was going to be bad, but, uh, I didn't expect it to be so difficult, especially since I went to school."
mm-hmm. it seems to knock you out of the ballpark when you're applying for something like that. you don't even consider you as a candidate?
"no, I'm not. if I don't know about it, I'm probably not, you know, it's a shame. I don't mean it's not bad. because of this issue, I don't get a lot of calls."
"mm-hmm, mm-hmm."
"- I'm sure. you know, I'm really angry with you, you know, and I'm kind of pissed off by the rest of my life, you know, and I'm kind of pissed off by the rest of my life. I'm very good with interviews. you know, I feel like they're offering me a job halfway through the interview, and they're telling me what I'm supposed to do and what I'm supposed to get. it's almost like a day and night."
mm-hmm.
"black and white. it's just going to stop. ""excuse me. I'm sorry. I. I'm not really able to help you. you're going to have to go, you know, and."
"so you're gonna interview before you even interview, right?"
"no, no, no, no. you know, there's a different situation. they ask, and I'll say something like, ""We'll discuss it in the interview."". I don't know, sometimes I'm thinking about it, and I don't know if I'll get a call or not. well, you know, but I've been on an interview, uh, you know, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh. I'm not filling it out- I'm filling it out for the application. they're usually just interviews. and then the end is the end."
looks like it's a done deal.
yes. it seems like it's going to be a deal. you'll just have to go through the interview. then-and-then-and-
mm-hmm.
"when I'm talking to the interview and it's going well, and they're like, ""Okay, all right, I think we can do something."". well, I mean, I'm qualified. what's the point of what's going on-- six years ago, six years ago, what's the point. in fact, the conviction was not violent, but it wasn't a conviction. I don't threaten the staff around me. it's not like a robbery. you know, it's a thing, you know?"
mm-hmm.
and
you're not hurting anyone.
"no, I'm not."
"you're not hurting anyone, are you?"
it's really frustrating because-
yes.
"-it's almost like I don't want to give up, but I'm not sure if I want to."
because you've done everything in school and you've done everything in the way of footwork and everything. you're really offering something to someone.
I'm sure.
"yes. and, uh, you know, it's like you're a leprechaun and a leprechaun colony."
mm-hmm.
did you ever start the interview with that conversation so you didn't have to go through it?
"no, I don't think so."
mm-hmm.
I'm thinking - I think - I
what would happen if you did it?
I guess they'll probably be kicked out immediately.
mm-hmm.
"-you know, you know, you know. um - - - - - -"
"and then they'll say, you know, what would you be like if you knew what you were doing and what you were good at?"
"well, it's-it's a shame. what do you mean?"
"mm-hmm. well, I mean, the lesser evil is what we're getting-"
mm-hmm.
"-you know what I'm talking about. as if you were what you wanted to say was if it was something I could do and then if they did, then I knew it was something I wanted to do."
"all right, so let's go. I wonder if the interview really is something else if you both know it from the beginning. the interview and not-not your criminal record will really be based on the interview."
"you know, I think as far as efficiency, you know, weeding out the things, not wasting my time, but I have to tell you something, a lot of people don't care about it."
mm-hmm.
"-I don't really want to do these jobs. what do you mean. well, it's just really frustrating."
you don't work for the government or the bank or the Fbl. it's a job where you'd wonder why a-a non-violent crime would be--
be a problem.
"all right, so let's go"
"well, then I'd like to tell anyone who might be interested-"
mm-hmm.
-it's not important-it's not important-
mm-hmm.
"-you know, it's not likely to be a job that's worth the interview."
you're not going to college.
"all right, so let's go"
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
"what do you know about what I'm talking about. I'll tell them before the interview and they'll be fine, just so you know before the interview. but at the same time, I don't want to be a mover or-"
mm-hmm.
"-a burger flipper or something like that. I don't think it's anything bad, but I feel like I'm offering something more-"
mm-hmm.
"-and, uh, I don't know, it's like being caught in a rock."
"mm-hmm. so, what did you look at, um, advocacy in this area or expungement or anything like that?"
"after all the reading I've done, I've become like mush."
what did you find out about this?
"I've learned that I'm a type of, uh, felony that's not to be expunged, I don't even have the type that's sealed. I'm supposed to go to the governor's office next to death row, you know, inmates or candidates for governor. it's all just a matter of what I'm supposed to have a class for one felony."
uh-huh.
"I don't know, I just, I mean, I just, I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I"
"I-I'm not sure. well, I know a little bit about it, and not, you know. that's very interesting. what about the groups that advocate?"
I looked at a couple of groups that supposedly help convicted felons.
mm-hmm.
-work.
mm-hmm.
"you know, I've seen a lot of dead ends."
mm-hmm.
"I've seen a lot of political stuff. I didn't think I'd be able to interview one of those counselors, you know, so I didn't really think about it. you know, I didn't think it was a place that would help. I've seen a lot of racism, but I guess I'd say a little bit of racism. I'm really hard to get in and interview with a counselor to match my job. if they work, they're great. I'm not very lucky with the group."
mm-hmm.
"you know, I'm thinking of you"
mm-hmm.
"well, I don't know. I'm not sure if there's anything else."
mm-hmm. you're a Middle Eastern man. I'm sure you've had some really bad experiences with racism and prejudice because of it.
mm-hmm.
"well, you're going to these places, and they're almost like a shop."
mm-hmm.
-type of place. the job market is terrible.
"all right, so let's go. it's-it's, uh-- It's a lot of things against me."
mm-hmm.
"all right, let's just say it like that."
mm-hmm. mm-hmm.
"well, uh, but that's not what it is."
what's the point of this?
"well, that's what-- Yeah. I can-- I can talk to you."
mm-hmm.
I'd imagine that I'd have a conversation with someone-
mm-hmm.
"-I'd probably want to hire you anyway. I guess it doesn't really matter what degree you have at this point. I'm not sure where you're going to school. it's all about who you know. we live in a very political city. at this point, jobs are scarce, so people who know people who know people who know people who know people who know people who know people who know people who know people who know people who know people who know people who know people who know people who"
mm-hmm.
"-and they're getting jobs. you know, if I'm going to school, you know, you know, uh, you know, uh, you know, uh, you know, you know, you know, you know, you. so it's been seven years since I've been."
it's been a long time.
"yes. you know, I probably won't report it, and I'll take it. it's been seven years since I've been. well, I'm good at, uh, interaction with people, so that's good."
mm-hmm.
"I've been clean for so long, so that's what it is. um - - - - - -"
you can prove it and document it.
yes.
yes. many people can't handle it.
they're not.
"yes. you went to school. all your movements are very positive, highly motivated. I think your ideas about the fact that one day you'll meet someone who works for a company that might not have a policy against you, and you'll meet someone who's working for a company that might not have a policy against you."
"yes. well, I hope it's true."
it's just for you. yes.
yes. that's my hope.
it's just a person.
it's true. It's true. it's true. It's true. It. I-I-I-I-I-I-
I think so.
yes.
no state or federal law says anything.
"no, no, no, no, no. it's just a person, but you're right. yes. it's - It's - It's"
"all right, all right, all"
but the thing is - but here's the thing -
"I'm right, I'm right, I'm right"
"all right, so let's go"
-we're looking for you. yes.
"after 9/11, a lot of companies have blindly adopted, you know, the kind of situa- and there's no- there's not, at this point - I mean,. there are many situations where people don't even know the truth about their criminal history."
mm-hmm.
I'm thinking of this-
mm-hmm.
"-well, people are now offering a background check, and they don't have any effectiveness because they don't have any background checks. I'm afraid that people will implement all these security measures, but they don't really know if they're true."
I wonder what it would be like if you checked your background and found out what was there.
I've done it. I've done
"you're doing it, aren't you?"
"yes, I'm sure. I'm gonna have one and I'm gonna have a little bit."
it's good for you to do it.
"all right, all right, all right,"
yes. he's smart. He's smart
"yes. thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I'm not sure. I guess I'm just, I guess-"
he was disappointed. He was disappointed.
what I really want to say - what I really want
"he was disappointed, yes."
"when I'm discouraged, I'm really here because I think I'm-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-"
mm-hmm.
"-despite all the good things I have, the only thing that's loud and clear is the things I don't have."
mm-hmm.
"if that's true, it makes sense."
"yes, it's true. I don't think you have a sense that a lot of it is about, uh, timing, luck, I mean, I'm sure you have a sense that it's all about- it seems to me- it's all about- it seems to. I'd be impressed if I were an employer."
thank you. Thank you. Thank you
"you're welcome. You're welcome. well, I've heard a couple of things from a client. if you'd like to know what he shared with me, I could tell you."
"yes, yes, I'm here."
"all right, all right, all. on the blogs of felons, he found the most reliable information."
"all right, all right, all right,"
they're experts on your behalf.
it's very interesting.
"they said, uh, they found out that there were places and companies open, but they also talked about what they found. family-owned businesses tend to be."
"yeah, but it's like who you know, right?"
"all right, all right, all right,"
I'm sure it's true-
or you can start your own business. I thought it was something really--
"yeah, I'm sure it's what I have. that's what I'm doing. I'm still in school, but I'm also starting to work, you know, I'm still in school. well, I don't have a fortune 500 company, but I'm a little bit of a fortune."
uh-huh.
"all of it, uh, you know, it's gonna be all right."
"you're an entrepreneur, so you're an entrepreneur."
"you know what. actually, I've read that you have to start your own business. what do you mean. you're not supposed to report anyone. I mean, I'm obviously not working with kids, like, if I don't get a waiver, I'm not working with kids."
mm-hmm.
as well as driving cars and stuff like that.
mm-hmm.
"well, it's not important to me. I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I"
"well, that's a different way of looking at it than what you've seen what you can do versus what you can't do."
"all right, so let's go"
"so, um, what kind of- what kind of- what kind of- what kind of. what's the matter with you. if you don't want to tell me, I know it's going to be fine, but you don't have to tell me if you don't want."
"no, it's like a party, you know, like a wedding planner, not like a wedding planner, but like."
you'd be great.
"you know, like, when they have a corporate event, you know, like, you know, they're."
uh-huh.
"-they need a chauffeur, a limo, they need it. I'm involved in planning the transport from the airport, uh, hotel, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,. it's just, I guess it's just a plan, but it's not a corporate, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh"
you're a corporate company.
"yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm trying to."
chief executive.
yes.
[laughter]
"I'm not sure about that, but I'm sure."
"so, so, so, so. well, in the recession, it's often the best time to start a business, uh, to see where there's a need to start."
"well, I guess it's just my only-"
"one, two, three, four"
"-but it's a good opportunity for me to work for myself. I'd like to work on my own, you know. well, uh, uh, uh"
are you comfortable with that?
"I'm fine, I'm comfortable with it. I'm doing well, you know, the few opportunities I've had to organize something like that. all right, it's okay. you know, I'm still going to school, you know I'm gonna be done with it."
I'm sure. it's great that you're doing this. it's true. It's true.
"I'm not gonna act, you know, I mean, I think I have-"
what would it be like to act?
"you know, I don't know, you know, I'm going back to my life, you know, crime or, uh, you know, you know, you know, you know,"
"all right, all right, all. Gottcha, I'm sorry. I"
"-and a destructive behavior. I'm not interested in destroying anything. you know, I'd like to be productive."
as you're now.
"you know what I mean? Like I said, I wouldn't have come in here if it were just a little bit of a peachy thing. it's a shame. It's a. I'm sick of rejection, and I'm thinking, why do I have to go to school. you know, I'm thinking of you. I just, I don't, I want to go to work, you know, I don't want to be, you know, I don't want to be. but if I don't, you know, I'm not gonna be able to, I'm not gonna be able to, you know?"
"so you don't have any control over the law of, uh, felonies. no one does it, no one. you know, and I'm thinking about how you've been talking about the interview and then you're talking about how you're going to be rejected, and-and even on the phone to see if it's true."
"yes. I've had one of those lately, and I'm supposed to be offered. I- I think he offered him a good job."
mm-hmm.
"you know, my brother, who knew him, gave me an interview. until he gave me the paperwork to sign the background check. I'm telling you, I'll sign it, but I just want to tell you that this is what you'll find."
"when he gave you the lead, he didn't know there was a background check?"
"no, he's done it. you know, don't tell me anything until I know what he said. he said he didn't know if they were."
"all right, all right, all"
"I just thought I'd give it a shot, but I thought I'd be able to spare myself a little, uh, frustration."
mm-hmm.
"-I'd like to try it. you know, I'd like to try, you know, you know, ""Do you hire criminals?"". anything, anything, anything."
you don't have a criminal record.
but I've been a criminal before.
that's right. you have been rehabilitated.
yes.
a new guy with a bright new face.
"all right, so let's go. well, I'm a new guy, but society is much more forgiving."
I'm sure.
"well, you know, I think it's a good idea to try to weed out, but how do you say that. you know, I'm thinking of you. how do you tell someone, you know, how do you- how do you tell someone?"
I'd say it's just a habit. I have a criminal record in my former life. I don't want to waste your time. what would you say to something like that?
"well, I'm thinking of something. I guess it's a little forward, but I think it's probably better if I tell them."
"mm-hmm, mm-hmm."
"yeah, you know, I'm sure. now I'm gonna try it."
"all right, all right, all. you know, I'd like to work on a couple of things, you know, like writing, you know, how you talk and you use words and stuff. because I think it's a good interview, and the more you do it, the better you do it. you've been practicing it a lot. that's-that's also useful."
yes.
"even though you're turned down, it's terrible. you'll be better at it, I'm sure."
"yes. the interview process - I mean, the interview process."
"uh-huh, uh-huh."
"-I'm not sure, I guess I never- yeah. no, I-I mean, I don't think I'm in trouble with the interview."
yes. I'm sure you'll be better.
yes. it was a lot of work.
you've been practicing a lot.
"it's been a long time, hasn't it?"
"yes. lastly, the same client was a group called the John Howard Society, which was a group of clients."
mm-hmm.
I'm not sure if you've ever-
I've heard of it. I'm not-I'm not-I
yes.
"he looked at him, but he didn't."
"well, they have a lot of good things to do, uh, they have a lot of good things to do, uh, they have a lot of good things to do."
yes.
"-they're so, uh, they're so prejudiced. they're really true. I'd also check with the ACLU. well, I don't know much, but I'm curious about it, and I want to know more."
yes. I'm sure. I've done a little bit of research on him.
mm-hmm.
"well, it turns out that recidivism is a big factor. you know-you know-you know"
absolutely.
-as far as people go back
absolutely.
"-and, uh, and, uh, and, uh, and, uh, and, uh, and, uh, and, uh, and, uh, and, uh,"
you can't vote.
it's really hard to deal with. I'm sure.
you can't vote.
I think that's what it really is - ignorance.
"when I found out, I was shocked."
yes.
I'm not sure I'd believe it.
yes.
"how many millions of people and when you think about it, um, hmm."
"yes, exactly."
"yes, mm-hmm."
I know there's a lot of bullshit.
mm-hmm.
yes.
"that's a great word. yes. so, uh-so, uh-so"
"you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know"
"yes. you know, if you want, you can check out the blogs. I'd like to find out if I can find him and find out about John Howard. if you want to see what you've found out, I'd really like to know."
"yes. I-I, you know, I-I, you know, I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I"
"mm-hmm, mm-hmm."
-I'm not saying stable because I'm not stable. I'm just. I'm just.
but it's affected him.
he's affected him. He's affected him.
"rejection, rejection, yes."
"yes, rejection. yes."
yes.
so I'm just gonna make sure I'm okay. so-so-so-so
yes.
"if you have any information, I'll share what I have with you."
I'll check you out. I'll do it. yes.
thank you for the suggestions. yes.
you're welcome. You're welcome. thank you for being so open to me. I'm glad you appreciate it.
it's not a problem. It's
"yes. all right, all right, all"
thank you. Thank you. Thank you
"all right, so let's get you a rinse. how do you feel about it?"
"all right, all right, all"
"all right, all right, all. look, see what you think. and that's what it's like to feel"
yes.
"-and the color is okay. well, I just wonder, um, about some of the stains, so I'm wondering, um, about smoking."
"oh, my God."
maybe-maybe-maybe-maybe-
I'll do it again.
"-coffee, tea, tea. I'm sure you heard it."
"I've done everything, I've done it all."
"mm-hmm. so, the smoking will not only affect the negative consequences. in fact, it affects the teeth, teeth-"
yes.
"-um, healing-um, healing-um"
yes.
"-in your mouth, in your mouth."
"all right, all right, all. sure."
so. so. so. so
I heard everything. I'm just gonna fix my teeth.
"yes, and I'd like to help you. I'm really committed to your oral health, so I'm taking a lot of medication, so I'm really interested in what you're saying. it's-- it's much easier to quit."
"I've done a pill, so I've tried it. I've tried it, and I've tried it. I've done the pills and they're not working."
mm-hmm. yes.
it's a waste and it's going to cause more damage.
"no, it's not a waste. people tend to quit smoking about seven times before they quit, so think of it as you're closer to quitting, so."
or seven lectures on the way.
I'm not sure I meant to lecture you. I'm-- I'm-- I
"no, no, no, no. no, I'm just thinking like that. I'm really-- I'm really defensive about it when they bring it to my family doctor, my cardiologist, everyone. I don't think I'm a complete fool. I'm against smoking, but."
"well, there's a reason why people are afraid."
-but it's not easy to quit.
"no, no, no, no. you tried the medication, you took it, you took it."
yes.
"so, you want me to write you a prescription. can we talk about what you're gonna do with it. it's something very important. not just for your health, but for your health."
"I guess I'm really interested in what I've tried to do, and I've usually gotten more trouble than it helped."
"no, the smoking will cause you more problems than anything else. I'm sure you'll be fine, David."
"all right, all right, all"
the side effects of smoking are much worse than the side effects of the medication.
mm-hmm.
I think it's something really important.
"all right, all right, all. all right, now I'm going to go?"
"all right, but you know--"
"I know what you're trying to do, but I don't want to be involved."
"all right, all right, all. thank you, and I'm really worried about smoking, so."
"all right, all right, all"
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
I'm glad you took care of me.
"I'm here to help you, okay?"
"all right, all right, all"
so. so. so. so
"all right, I've done the exam. I'm happy to tell you the good news and the bad news. it seems you don't have any cavities, so that's good news."
that's great. It's great.
but I'm really worried about something I've noticed in your mouth. I noticed a lot of irritation when you looked up. I wonder what you're saying on your form.
I'm not smoking cigarettes.
"all right, all right, all. in particular, there's a lot of irritation, especially, as I said, in particular, as I mentioned, the red spots on your mouth. you probably didn't notice because we don't look at the roof of our mouth, but you're damaging your mouth tissue, which can cause serious problems in your mouth. it's called a stomatitis of nicotinic. we don't see it in patients who don't smoke. you don't smoke cigarettes, do you smoke cigarettes. is there anything else that could be contributing. because I don't know what else could be causing it."
"we like to go out with my friends, you know, we like to go out to the lounge."
mm-hmm.
"sometimes, they're young men who give you a little different thing. I used to use a little mini cigar, and I used to use it in the peach and grape and grape and."
"well, I think it's a common misconception, because they're flavored, people think they're okay. it's really bad for you. you know, I've been thinking about it a"
"really. bad. but they're just little, tiny, tiny, cute little girls."
"all right, so let's go. it's still cigarettes and they cause lung cancer, oral cancer, emphysema, all the same things you'd see with cigarettes."
"well, I'm just using them for a little bit of a rest. I mean, I don't smoke 20 or 30 cigarettes a day, but I smoke them when we go out."
"uh-huh. well, at least you don't do it, so it's good, but it's still causing a lot of problems. as I said, you have a serious damage to your mouth, and I'm sure you're causing damage to the roof of your mouth. do you think you'd like to quit?"
"well, I didn't really know I'd started."
what's the matter with you?
"it wasn't really anything more than a social drink, just something I'm doing when I'm with my friends at the bar."
so you're gonna be gone?
maybe.
"what if I say, maybe. I'm telling you, it's really bad for you. you're putting yourself in danger of all the other diseases. it's really important that we have this. you're gonna have to stop."
I have to think about it.
"what do you think about what. you said you don't do it so often, and there's all these negative consequences, and you're putting yourself in danger."
"I'm just doing something to calm down, and I don't do it so often. so I'm probably going to cut it off."
"all right, that's a good start, but it's not going to cut it. if you quit smoking, you can reverse all the damage you've done to your mouth, and you can stop smoking. but if you continue to use these cigars, you're really in danger."
"well, I'm not sure they're cigarettes. I choose what I want to do, and I choose what I choose. I'll think about it, but I don't think I'm ready to cut it off. I don't really know if what you're telling me is true."
"you choose to damage your mouth and you can cause problems with your teeth. maybe you'll notice your teeth are a little darker than they used to be. it's a side effect. any tobacco use, whether it's cigarettes, cigars, snuff, snuff, hookah, hookah, hookah, hookah, hookah, hookah, hookah, hookah, hookah, hook. you made a very important decision, and you said you chose it, but you really chose to die."
I'll think about it.
"all right, I'm glad you're thinking about it. I'm hoping you'll think about it a little hard. because it's something that needs to change, I'll keep asking you about it."
"hello, hello, hello, hello,. I'm really glad you came to see me talk about stopping smoking."
"hello, hello, hello, hello,"
what do you want to do with us?
"if you're offering me some, I need some medicine."
"absolutely, we're in the right place."
"well, whatever else you can do to get me out of the smoking."
"all right, all right, all. you know, just remind me why you're not."
"I smoke 20, 30 a day, I'm sick of it. I saw my friends stop smoking, and it's kind of weird to see me smoking."
"all right, and so it's a little bit of pressure."
"I was at the restaurant a little. you know, it was a little embarrassing."
"being alone can't be a little uncomfortable. it seems to be a reason to quit, so it smells and it's embarrassing."
mm-hmm.
any other reasons for this?
"well, it's a little expensive right now."
how much do you pay for a week?
"I'm going to buy a pack of cigarettes every day, so it's almost £7."
£7 a week or a day?
"£7 a day, so-"
you're going to have a pack a day.
"-you're talking about £40, uh."
"£50 a week, £50 a week."
"£50 a week, £50 a week."
"you know, it's even worse."
yes.
"all right, all right, all. so we're going to spend £50 a week."
yes.
"-being one of the few who smoke in the crowd, and not liking the smell. it seems to be three reasons."
mm-hmm.
isn't it enough to say goodbye to cigarettes?
yes.
"all right, all right, all right,. when you want to stop smoking, do you have a date?"
what do you think you're doing?
"if you don't have a lot of stress and strain, it's usually good."
mm-hmm.
what's the main reason you smoke. what's the most fun you've had?
"it's just fun. something, uh, when I'm bored, I smoke."
mm-hmm.
"-or sometimes I'm out, but I'm the only one who's not."
"all right, all right, all. what will you miss the most?"
it's a lot of stress for me.
what kind of stress is it?
"when I'm down, uh, for a break."
mm-hmm.
"I'm not going down, I'm just gonna take a break. well, I-I really enjoyed it. I'm just gonna calm down with a cigarette."
yes. what's your favorite cigarette?
it's definitely the last one.
"all right, so the end of the day."
yes.
"-the thing that will help you relax, end the work section and move on to your own time."
yes.
"all right, all right, all. what if you quit the job first day, what if you're not going to smoke?"
"I guess, um, I'll try to breathe a little fresh air, but this time I don't have a cigarette, but I'm trying to keep my regular habits."
"all right, all right, all"
it's a tough thing.
did you ever stop smoking?
I've been working for a couple of weeks.
"all right, all right, all. what's the reason for your return?"
"in fact, I remember the stress of my argument with my partner."
something happened to you-
yes.
"-so you've been back in it. all right, let's go. Let. I just want to make sure I understand what's going on. you're the last guy in the group who smokes, and you don't really like the smell."
mm-hmm.
"the main reason you smoke is because, at the end of the day, it relaxes you, and if you smoke, it's a little soothing."
mm-hmm.
you want to stop and you want to choose when you want to stop. when do you think you'd be a good time to choose your last?
I'm supposed to go to a party this weekend.
"all right, all right, all"
"well, maybe Monday morning."
"it's going to be a good day on Monday morning. all right, all right, all. we recommend you use medication to help you in the pharmacy. it increases your chances of success and it's more likely to be able to handle any craving. you know, people use nicotine replacement therapy in a variety of ways, like patches, gum, you know, they use them all. you can get a tablet from the doctor."
mm-hmm.
"so, you've got something you'd like to use to help you with your cravings?"
yes. I think one of those patches.
"all right, all right, all. so you've seen the patch, and-"
yes.
"-and I'll show you what they look like. it takes 10 to 12 weeks to take the medication. we strongly recommend that you stay on the medication and that you have the best chance of success. it's not easy to stop smoking, but it's possible, and with the help we offer here, you'll be able to do it four times more than you can. you said you wanted to do it, and you said it sounded like a good day for you."
mm-hmm.
"you have a day when you're done with work, and you might as well have a cigarette. I'd recommend you use two products, maybe even a little bit, and I'd like to suggest you use something that you can add to it. people who smoke often know what it's like to smoke. what do you think it's like when you don't want to smoke?"
I'm just irritated.
"all right, all right, all"
yes.
I want to stop the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal.
"well, I'm thinking of something"
I'd say you should have the patch. I'll talk about how you use it and how you use it and how you use it and how you use it and how you use it and how you use it and how you use it and how you use it and how
"all right, all right, all"
"so, you're happy to have the date?"
absolutely.
"all right, and will you come back and see me?"
"of course, of course."
what if you don't come back?
a nice call from the phone.
I'd be happy to help you.
"in the last year, I've been writing a prescription for antibiotics, so I'm thinking, but in the chart, it seems like he's had a lot of them."
yes.
it's a big problem.
we both have a lot of stress. he's really upset. He's really upset.
smoking is actually a major risk factor for multiple ear infections in children. you're smoking?
"yeah, I smoke, but I'm not smoking. I'm really trying not to smoke him."
"so, what do you think he's exposed to smoke, and so, what do you think he's exposed to smoke?"
"I don't know. I'm not sure. I'm really trying not to smoke him. I'm not smoking in the car. when he's home, I'm smoking. I know it's bad, and I know it's bad for him, so I'm trying really hard not to be around him."
"I'm really interested in you stopping smoking. for your health and for Aiden. s-smoking is associated with ear infections, so it's going to be pretty soon that you'll have to put a tube in his ears. and so on. it's really dangerous for him. besides, kids who smoke are smoking themselves. will he be a smoker?"
"no, but I'm not smoking. I thought about it, but it's really hard to do it."
"all right, now it's time to go. you can't smoke anymore. and for you, too, like I said. you risk lung cancer, emphysema, oral cancer, heart disease, all sorts of things."
"I'm sure, I'm sure. I heard it was said to me, I heard it. I'm not sure how to do it. how do I get out of here. it's so hard to do it."
"now you can use all sorts of things. it's not as hard as it used to be. you can replace nicotine with a substitute. there's patches, there's liqueurs, there's gum, there's the inhaler, there's the nasal spray. we'll talk about the medication. you can try Chantix, Zyban, you can try to go to a hotline."
I'm not interested in any of this.
"you can't really quit, it's really important."
"I'm sure. I'm sure it's true. everyone has a problem, right. it's really hard."
what's more important than your baby's health?
I'm not sure.
I'm really interested in your decision to stop smoking. it's really important that we have this.
I'll look at everything and I'll see what I can find out there and I'll try to find something.
"all right, all right, all. you really have to think about this. as I said, it's dangerous for you and your baby."
"all right, whatever. all right, all right, all"
"all right, all right, all"
I'm glad you came to the woman's exam today. I think we've addressed a lot of your concerns. but I'd like to ask you about smoking. would it be okay if I do it?
"yeah, I'd say so."
"all right, all right, all. how much do you smoke in a day. you've said it's been twice or three times a day."
"well, I smoke, you know, like, once in the morning, uh, during lunch, and then at night, maybe five or six."
"all right, all right, all. so, for eight cigarettes. so you've been under half a pack for a day?"
yes.
"all right, all right, all. and that's changed over the time period?"
I smoke a little bit more than a year ago.
"all right, all right, all. the smoking has increased over the last year. and that's mainly in the evening?"
"yes. I'm trying to never smoke around my son, so I'm trying to keep him away. I usually wait till he's asleep."
mm-hmm. you can relax and relax.
"yes, exactly. I'm telling you, my schedule is a little crazy. I'm working full-time, and I'm starting to go to school. in the evening, I enjoyed it together with all of it."
sure. sure. you have a lot to relax.
mm-hmm.
do you do anything else to relax?
maybe I'll have a drink or two.
"all right, all right, all. a drink or two. how many drinks do you drink in a day?"
maybe two max.
two max. how many drinks would you have in a week?
"I'm not sure. I'm not really sure why you're asking. you know, I've been here for a visit. I'm not talking about my drink."
"no, I'm sure- I'm sure. I certainly don't want to tell you what to do, Sarah. I'd like to hear your thoughts and share some information with you, and what you do with it is completely up to you. you have a lot of things to do. you're a mom, you work, you're at school, and our health team is looking for all the resources you need to achieve your goals. I'm your doctor, and I'm listening to you and sharing information with you about your health problems, including smoking and alcohol. would you like to do this?"
"yeah, I'd say so."
"all right, all right, all. in particular, smoking and alcohol are associated with certain types of cancer; cervical cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, and, uh, also pancreatic cancer. he also has a high risk of liver and lung disease, as well as hypertension and cholesterol. it's a lot of information, but I-"
yes.
"-you're interested in what you think, Sarah."
"well, I'm just a little surprised, 'cause I don't drink or smoke. I smoke a lot less, and I'm trying to keep it pretty low."
you deliberately try to cut back.
yes.
"I have a ready ruler in my pocket, 0 means I'm not ready to stop smoking. where do you think you're going to be?"
maybe five.
it's about five. you're halfway there. why do you choose five?
you've mentioned some scary things like cancer or something like that. I don't want anything to happen to me as a mother.
"all right, so let's go. it's a lot of information to think about. given that you have a possibility of healthcare concerns, and you're worried about your family, you have a goal to achieve, where do you think you should go. in other words, what steps would you consider to be taken to reach 10?"
maybe I'll try to cut a little bit in the evenings.
"all right, so, great. let's see how much we can quantify it. how many cigarettes are there?"
"you know, if I have five or six, I'll try to smoke three at night."
"all right, all right, all. so you're cutting a little bit. it's a big step. I wonder if we could-- would you like to come back in four weeks to review the plan?"
yes. sure.
"all right, all right, all right,. at this point, we'll also review your lab results and your plan. shall I tell you something about smoking cessation?"
I-I think it would be useful.
"all right, all right, all. I have a brochure here and it's really good. if you're interested in nicotine, there's some tricks to distract you. so it's- so it's- so"
mm-hmm.
"-I was helpful, uh, before patients. would you like to see a counselor?"
what exactly do you want to tell me?
"Dr. Kirtley is a counselor and he's an expert in-- in talking about the association between alcohol and stress. I'd like to share something with you. women should not exceed the recommended seven drinks of alcohol per week, to avoid the risk of health problems we mentioned earlier."
mm-hmm.
"you indicated that you drank a little more than you should have, and you were at risk. so I'm asking if you'd like to talk to Dr. Kirtley."
"I'd like to talk about stress, but I don't know if I'm talking about it."
"of course, of course. I'm glad you're willing to talk to him. we'll stop by the scheduler's desk and see you in four weeks, and then we'll see you at Dr. Kirtley's. you'll be all right before you leave. Sarah, do you have any questions?"
I'm not sure.
"all right, all right, all. all right, I'm glad you're here. I'll see you in a month."
"all right, all right, all"
"hello, Sandra, I'm sorry. I"
hello. Hi. Hi. Hi
"I'm glad you came in for a minute. I'm sure you don't have much time, but I'm really grateful you came."
"well, I'm here today because my daughter is in the hospital. I'm not going to quit, but I'm enjoying it. I don't want to give it up. I have a lot of problems in my life."
"when you came to the hospital with your daughter, you didn't think about anything, but you didn't think about anything at the time. so, what did you do to make it possible for you to come. what were you thinking about?"
"I think it's important because I'm a bad role model for my daughter, and she's 12, and she's already smoking, so I don't want her to think it's a bad thing."
you'd like your daughter to smoke.
"I've smoked since I was a kid, and I'm not interested in her."
"well, I'm thinking of something. you said you were a little worried about smoking, but you didn't really want to smoke immediately, but you didn't want to smoke."
that's true. it's so hard to do it. I don't have it yet.
so what's good about smoking. what do you like about it?
"it's very pleasant, relaxing, you know, a stress reliever. we all go out and smoke and talk about things. I'd hate to not smoke. I'd be left out."
what else. tell me what else is good about it.
"after I eat, I like to smoke. it's like I'm done with it, stop eating, I'm full. it's a way to-- you know, sometimes I'll have a cigarette instead of a snack, so I'm able to control my weight."
"all right, all right, all. do you like anything else?"
"I'd like to think about it. well, I'm just enjoying it. I know, but I'm used to smoking. I'm not really thinking about it."
"I want to know if I've missed anything or left anything out, so I can understand everything you like about smoking."
"all right, all right, all"
"it seems like a way to calm down. it's a social activity that you can only do at work, and it's hard to imagine what it would be like to do it at work."
that's true. yes.
"he also mentioned that smoking is a way to manage weight, and that smoking after meals is pleasant, and that smoking is pleasant, and that smoking is pleasant, and that smoking is pleasant, and that smoking is pleasant, and that smoking is pleasant, and"
yes.
"I've heard it's a big part of your life. it's something that you've done for a long time, and it's almost impossible to think of yourself as a non-smoker. do you think it's good or bad things that keep you smoking?"
it's exactly. It's exactly
I hear you like smoking a little bit. what about the other side. do you have any bad things to tell me?
"well, I'm worried about my kids. I'm a bad parent, and I wonder if they've seen me smoking for years. I'm sure my daughter won't start smoking, and some of her friends smoke."
"Sandra, can you tell me about the time you've done something that you think left a bad impression on your daughter?"
"I was smoking in the morning, and then she looked out the window and looked at me."
"it really made her feel how she watches you, and she really likes you and notices what you're doing. how did you feel when she saw you?"
"I'm really bad, you know, I'm projecting-- I want to be a good parent, and I don't feel like it's part of the plan."
"thank you for your honesty. I'm glad it's a difficult question. it's a difficult thing to give up. you know, I think one thing that's important to you is that you talk about how being a good parent is the highest priority, and I think it's important to you to do it."
mm-hmm.
"-um, and I hear you say smoking is important for stress relief, socializing, and it's something you can't imagine ever changing. how do you fit these two things?"
"it's not going to fit. it's the opposite side of the coin. I'm really enjoying it, but I don't think it's right."
what would be more important to you to quit smoking or change your smoking?
now I don't know what to do.
"all right, all right, all"
I'm not planning on quitting. I just thought of something.
"so, it's not so much that you don't want to quit, but it's almost, ""How can I do it?"""
it's exactly. It's exactly
"all right, all right, all. I'm glad you appreciate it. we probably wasted our time. if you'd like to schedule another appointment, I'd like to see you next week. is it something that would help you?"
"of course. sure, I'll come in. yes."
"all right, all right, all. so I'm hearing. [crosstalk]"
we'll talk about it more.
"I don't think it's the most exciting thing, but I appreciate you're willing to do it. will you do a little homework next week. it won't be too much of a task. we have a booklet that we like to give people who are just thinking about changing, who don't know if they're ready to change, and one of the exercises is to write down your top three reasons for change. and then, as we talked about, and some of the less good things we've done to quit smoking, and some of the good things we've done to continue to smoke. do you want to do it for a couple of days?"
"all right, all right, I'll try it."
"all right, let's go."
thank you. Thank you. Thank you
"thank you very much, Sandra. next week we'll see you."
"all right, let's go. Let"
I've written Aiden a prescription for antibiotics.
"all right, all right, all"
"well, I'd like to talk to you. I'm a little worried about how many times he's had ear infections. I noticed you've checked the box that someone smokes in the house. I'm wondering if you'd like to tell me more."
"well, I smoke with him and I'm smoking. I'm trying to avoid him, but I smoke for 10 years. being a single mom and working full-time is stressful. and that's why I've been smoking."
smoking is a way to relax and relax.
yes. a glass of wine is a good thing. I'm smoking. I'm smoking. I'm
sure. you seem to try not to smoke. why did you decide to do this?
"it's not good for him. I mean, I read about ear infections and asthma and everything, but I'm not smoking."
"you're worried about how he's going to affect you and on the other hand, you don't know if it's really the smoking?"
"all right, so let's go. yes. he's not allergic to asthma. yes. he's not a problem for his friends, so he doesn't have a lot of problems. in the past, I thought about quitting, but I just don't think it's possible."
why did you quit smoking when you were pregnant?
"we shared everything and I knew he'd get a little of it. if something happened to him, I didn't think I'd be able to survive."
but it's too much of a challenge to even try to manage or even try?
"yes, exactly."
how did you do it when you quit?
"I'm not sure. now I'm thinking, I don't even know how I did it. I've done it. I've done it. I just couldn't imagine him not being born or having a baby."
mm-hmm.
"-and he's got a problem with women who smoke, and everything they talk about with women who smoke. ""all right, I'm not going to risk it."". so, so, so, so"
mm-hmm. you were so scared then that you stopped?
yes.
but now you're not afraid of them?
"no, I mean, we're two different people. as I said, I'm not, I'm trying to keep my mouth shut. I'm pretty good about it. I'm not gonna let anyone smoke around him. well, I'm, you know, I'm, you know"
you can only do what you can.
"yes, I'm sure."
"all right, all right, all. but you really want to quit?"
"yes. I know I have to, and I know I have to, but I'm saying, ""Okay, I'm not smoking anymore."". it's not going to happen to quit."
it's on the list of tasks. isn't it going to be the top?
yes.
"where do you think you're going to be at the end of the scale, 1 to 10, where 1 is not confident, and you don't think you can do it, and 10 is you're pretty sure you can?"
"I guess it's 5. kind of in the uncertain area. it seems like I've done it before, so I'm sure I can do it, but it's hard to think about it. and it's not the same thing."
"well, what's the point of five or two or three?"
"I know- I know all the ways it's bad for me. I'm not gonna let him smoke. I'm not gonna use him to chew or anything like that. I know I have to, especially before he gets old enough to understand what mommy's doing, but I don't know if I can."
"all right, all right, all. you seem to have a lot of reasons to quit. you've done it before, and you're a little hesitant about your ability to quit?"
yes.
where do you think we're going to go?
I'm not sure. I-I'd like to ask you for help. I'm not sure what kind of help I need.
"sure. I can definitely talk to you about it. in fact, many of the new options that can help people succeed in their attempts to quit can actually help them. you can try different medicines."
I'm not a fan of medicine.
"all right, all right, all. you can take a lot of support groups and classes with other people. for people who smoke, it can be a big part of the support, especially if they have a lot of stress."
I don't know if I have the time for it.
sure. it seems like something that would take a long time and maybe not fit in your life. I'm wondering if we could discuss some options that might fit in your life.
it would be great.
"all right, all right, all. if you want, we can set up another appointment where you can come in and we can talk about it."
I'd like to do it. that's great. It's going to be great
"all right, so let's get"
thank you. Thank you. Thank you
sure.
"all right, now it's going to be a tough job. so the good news is that there's no cavity."
"all right, so, great."
"yes, I'm always happy to hear it. I'm also concerned about your mouth because I see irritation in your mouth."
"it's bad, but it's not so"
"yes, it's true. I wonder if you'd like to tell me a little about how tobacco is affecting your life right now."
"it's tobacco. well, I'm not smoking cigarettes. I didn't smoke cigarettes. I'm going out with my friends. we're going to the bar and we'll have a couple of drinks and smoke a little cigarillo. they don't look like cigarettes and they certainly don't look like cigarettes. I mean, I'm sure you'll have a couple of them in the evening with my friends, but I'm sure not 20 or 30 of them."
"you made a decision not to smoke cigarettes, so you didn't want to do it. you seem to be concerned about the health effects of smoking. you've been smoking a little cigarillo every time you go out."
"but that's just a social thing. we're doing something like that with my friends. we don't have to talk about it, you know, when we go out for a night. they don't have them in the pack."
"you don't smoke cigarettes, you don't smoke cigarettes, you don't smoke cigarettes."
"no, no, no, no, no. no, no, no, no"
you smoke so small that you can't even imagine the damage it would cause to your mouth.
"all right, we have a point. when we have a break, you know, I'm starting to smoke, and so every time we have a break, you know, I'm smoking. I like the peach flavor. but it's really only recently."
"uh-huh. now smoking is a big part of your social life. you smoke when you go out, and even when you're at work, you smoke."
"yeah, yeah, yeah. now you're telling me it's true. I smoke a lot of cigarettes."
what do you like about it besides the social aspect?
"it's nice to be with people, but it's a little relaxing. when we go to Vegas, it's really fun, and it's really fun, and so, you know, when we're in Vegas, it's really fun, and so, you know, it's really fun, and so, you know,"
"all right, all right, all"
I'm not saying I'm a smoker.
"all right, all right, all. what about the other side. did you notice anything bad about smoking?"
"I'd like to ask you about the fact that I noticed that the teeth are more stained than a couple of years ago, and so I'm thinking it's something to do with smoking."
"yes. with smoking, we notice some pretty negative consequences to your oral health. do you have any other things to worry about?"
"well, uh, uh, uh. well, you know, it's the cost. I have to be careful about money and so, um, I have to pay for it. so the money is also a concern."
"mm-hmm. so you have your oral health, your financial situation, and then you've mentioned some concerns about smoking cigarettes and how they can be harmful."
"yes, I'm sure."
do you know that smoking these little cigarillos can cause the same negative health effects as smoking?
"absolutely not. of course, I didn't think about it as a smoking habit or anything that would be dangerous."
mm-hmm. it's kind of surprising that you've done something you've done and you've done more and more.
"yes, I'm sure. when you asked if I'd use tobacco, I checked the box."
"mm-hmm. now that you realize you're actually smoking and you might actually cause some serious health problems, what do you think about what you're doing now?"
"I'm really worried, I mean, I don't want to, um, develop cancer, lung cancer, or any of the terrible things that happen to smoking. so-so-so-so"
mm-hmm.
-I'm very concerned about it.
"the good news is that, when you stop smoking, you can reverse all the negative effects that have occurred and you can also know that you can stop the progression of any."
really?
yes. do you want to know something like that?
"I'd do it. I'd like to do it because I'm a brand new smoker. until I met you, I didn't know I was smoking."
"mm-hmm. well, if you think about it on a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is really not to think about it, 10 is really confident you can stop."
I'm probably going to be in seven or eight. I'm pretty sure I can stop.
"all right, what's the difference between seven and eight?"
"because I don't live my daily life. when I'm in the morning, I don't have to smoke. I'm not smoking 20 or 30, so I'm not so much exposed to it."
"mm-hmm. you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,. so, where do you think we're going to go?"
"I really want to know more about quitting. I heard there's a new medication, there's a new way to help people quit smoking, I really want to quit."
"all right, I'll talk to you about it and I'll tell you some tips and suggestions about where you can get some help with quitting."
it would be great. thank you. Thank you. Thank you
I'm really glad you're talking to me about it.
thank you. Thank you. Thank you
"hello, Jean. Hi, Jean. Hi. I'm Dr. Selby's assistant. I'm glad you're here. I'm glad"
"hello, doctor. I'm sorry. I have"
how can I help you?
"doctor, I've been diagnosed with pneumonia for three months, and I've been diagnosed with COPD."
"yes, I'm sure."
although I didn't call right away. I'm really interested in quitting smoking.
"all right, so let's go"
"well, I thought it was my first step. so, uh, we have to do something."
"it's time to do something, okay. you were diagnosed by the doctor-"
a doctor of medicine.
"a doctor diagnosed it, and how do you feel about it?"
"I'm really scared, 'cause I'm not feeling well."
mm-hmm.
"I'm not feeling well. even when I'm on the phone with customers, I cough."
"all right, let's go. Let. you seem to have been smoking for a long time, and then you got a diagnosis, and now you're really scared and worried."
mm-hmm. I don't know what I'm gonna do about it.
"all right, all right, all right,. you've thought about when you want to go?"
"I have six months, six months, and I'm thinking, well, I'm going to fail. I'm not even 50%."
"all right, all right, all. you say you feel a little under-confident that you'll be able to quit smoking in six months, but you're afraid you won't be able to do it."
"I'm not sure what to do. I tried to quit smoking. I took pills, I took the pills."
mm-hmm.
"I've been through therapy. nothing helped, nothing helped. I've finally- I've been to the doctor. I've actually been to the hospital. I've been in the hospital for a week. I've been gone for a long time."
"all right, so let's go. you were able to quit smoking, but only after you were in the hospital."
I'm not going to have any choice. I smoked again the next day.
"all right, all right, all. I'd like to ask you a question so I can better understand what you're having trouble with. what do you think is good about smoking?"
"it's part of my life. when I was 13, 14, I started smoking. my parents smoked. all of them smoked. he was on TV. everyone looked so nice."
mm-hmm.
"I didn't really think about smoking, or wearing clothes, or having a drink, or anything. I guess it's just my extension. it's good for my nerves."
"all right, so let's go"
"I'm sure it's true. ""oh, I'll take a cigarette and think about it,"" I'll say, ""Oh, I'm going to be stressed."""
"sure. I want to know what you think of smoking, Jean. so you'll calm down. it's something you can do. it's part of your picture. you're sophisticated, you feel like a real man. you're like a movie. it seems like it makes you feel like that. so you're saying it's okay?"
that's right.
"all right, all right, all. do you have anything I've missed?"
"well, I'm really enjoying it. it's just. it's soothing me. after lunch, it's great."
mm-hmm.
"-we're just a little group of people, uh, my family."
"all right, so let's go"
we go out in the yard with the people I work with.
sure.
"-you have a cigarette and talk. that's how you're making friends. we're a little group now, we're a little group."
"when everyone else smokes, it's hard to quit smoking. it's easy to go out and have a break."
"I didn't think about it like that, but I guess you're right."
you told me what you liked about smoking. what's not so good about smoking?
I'm sick of my health and I'm scared.
mm-hmm.
"I'm not feeling well. even when I'm on the phone with customers, I cough."
do you have anything else to smoke?
"I smoked 30, 40, sometimes 50 cigarettes a day. I'm starting to buy different makeup because I'm starting to age, and I'm starting to get wrinkles and wrinkles and my skin is really dry."
"all right, all right, all. so I'm gonna make sure I understand this. the health effects of smoking are the health effects of smoking, the health effects of smoking, the health effects of smoking, the health effects of smoking, the health effects of smoking, the health effects of smoking, the health effects of smoking, the health effects. and then the price of cigarettes."
"yes, I'm sure."
"given everything going on in your life, from 1 to 10, what is the most important thing to do, and 1 is the least important thing to do, what is important to you?"
I'd say it's 10 or 10 out of 10 that I should stop smoking.
"of course, it's the most important thing."
"yes, I'm sure. 100% of the most important thing."
I'll ask you another question and then I'll ask you. how confident are you that you'll be able to quit?
"well, I'd say 35 or 40% of the experts."
"35-40%. all right, all right, all"
"yes. I'd like to tell you more, but."
"all right, all right, all. you said 40, but you didn't say anything like 10 or zero."
"I guess I'm still a fighter, and I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-. I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-. so-so-so-so"
mm-hmm.
"-it's a big step. so I'm guessing, yes. maybe last week, maybe not."
"all right, all right, all. so you're saying 30 to 40. what's the point of building confidence to 45%?"
"maybe if I came to visit you, or maybe something was suggested, maybe if there was a group. I-I'm not sure, but I-I'm gonna need help."
"if you're in trouble, it'll help you say you've dropped 40% to 45%."
I think it's because I'm a little better today than I was yesterday.
"all right, all right, all"
I'm talking about things that help me. I'm always better when I'm done with it.
"all right, all right, all. I'm really happy to congratulate you on taking this important first step to address this problem, but I wonder if you'd be open to actually just monitoring your smoking. as you mentioned, smoking is so automatic for you that sometimes writing it down helps you to write it down. I've noticed you're saying you're losing control of cigarettes. you can control what you're doing if you're just conscious and writing something down. that's usually the first step. what do you think about it?"
"in other words, don't just do it automatically."
that's true. It's true. writing it down will help you.
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. I guess because I might be tempted to fight it, and, uh, maybe wait till the next impulse."
mm-hmm.
"-and maybe I'll mark it down when something goes wrong. yes, I-I'll try it."
"all right, all right, all. I'll give you a little card that will help you keep track of him. we could discuss it if you bring it to the next meeting. all right, all right, all. any other things?"
"no, I'm working on something until I see you next week."
"all right, so, so,. thank you very much for coming."
"thank you, doctor."
you're welcome. You're welcome.
do you want us to go through the form you've filled out. everyone who comes in will be given it.
mm-hmm.
"all right, let's go. Let. you've written that you drank alcohol in the last year, and you've used marijuana more often in the last year."
it's something like that.
"all right, all right, all. I always tell students what to do when we talk about substance use. it's not my job. instead, I'm interested in seeing what they'd like to do if they wanted to use them. what about marijuana use?"
"I'm smoking. I'm smoking. I'm. I'm smoking, but I don't smoke."
"all right, all right, all. how often do you have to?"
a couple of times a month.
do you smoke anything else than marijuana?
someone gave me a peppermint oil.
"all right, all right, all. shall I share some of your information?"
mm-hmm.
"the effects of marijuana on the brain are known. it can make you concentrate, you can't concentrate, you can't remember things, and vaping can cause lung damage. after the first use of marijuana, about one in six people will be addicted. what do you think I've told you?"
I'm not sure it's going to hurt me.
what do you think it's gonna affect you?
"well, I'm not sure. it's fun to laugh with my friend."
"do you worry about marijuana, or something else?"
I'm not going to be in trouble at school.
how can you be in trouble at school?
I'm going to be suspended and I'm gonna be kicked out of the team.
you're important to stay in school and play basketball?
"all right, so let's go"
do you want to change anything about marijuana use?
"well, I've been thinking about not using it in the beginning of the basketball season."
what would it be worth to you?
"well, I'm better when I'm not so high."
the marijuana affects how well you're playing. what else would you get out of it?
"I'm not going to be caught with a pen, so I'm not going to be on the basketball team."
"all right, all right, all. you're supposed to be on the basketball team, so you don't use marijuana. how long do you think you'll be able to use it?"
it's been a month since I've been.
"all right, all right, all. what number would you choose if I asked you to choose a number, 0 to 10, 0 meaning you don't know what you're going to do?"
"well, seven, I'm counting."
"seven, seven, seven, seven,. why do you think you're picking a lower number?"
I'm sure I'll stop using it for a month. I'd like to play well.
what steps can you take to stop using?
"well, I'm not sure."
what about this question. what if you want to try it in a month?
I usually want to smoke when I'm stressed or unhappy.
what else would you do if you feel like it?
I'm playing games like that.
any other things?
my friend Sarah and I can play basketball.
it's a way to feel better playing basketball and playing video games.
yes.
"I'm glad you've decided to quit for a month, and I'm sure you'll be able to achieve your goal. I'd be curious to hear how you're planning to go about it in a month."
mm-hmm.
"all right, let's go to basketball practice. I'll see you Monday through Thursday, and I'll see you when you need something or want to talk."
"all right, David, all right, David. so, what do you think, and how do you feel?"
"well, that's good. It's a good"
you want to-
"you have to check it out, okay."
"-look, what do you think. what do you think about this?"
it's really nice that it's fixed.
yes.
you've taken care of that bad guy.
yes.
-the color was there.
"yes. no, no, no, no"
I'm glad you like it.
"it's going well. all right, all right, all. all right, so, so,. in fact, I've noticed a lot of stains. I wonder what you think about what might be related."
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry. all usual suspects, smoking, wine, coffee."
yes.
-all of this.
do you think about quitting smoking?
"yeah, I thought about it. I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-. I've been doing it all my life."
"all right, all right, all. I'm one more person, the next doctor who says, ""You have to stop smoking, David."""
"yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
"I'm sorry, but I don't mean that."
"yeah, I-I-I-I know I'm not an idiot, people know it's smoking. [cough] It's not easy to quit."
"if it's as easy as the doctor says, or your partner."
yes.
-saying-saying-saying
who would have been?
-you're gonna have to go.
you'd be a fool to do it.
yes.
-if you're gonna do it like that.
yes.
I've heard it all day.
yes. what have you ever smoked. tell me-- How long have you been smoking?
I smoked 40 years ago.
mm-hmm.
"-and I've done it a couple of times, but, you know, it's been consistent. now I'm not gonna change my mind."
mm-hmm.
whatever I'm talking about or what they're talking about.
you seem to have tried a lot of things that aren't what you're doing.
I don't think it's going to work for me
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes"
"no, no, no, no"
yes.
"it's probably the only thing that will do it to anyone who has done it. mysel- My group, it's cold."
mm-hmm.
"then they fight, but I choose them."
mm-hmm.
-and I'm not interested in lectures.
yes. you really have to choose. you're absolutely right about that.
yes.
"-no one has the right to tell you what to do. um, can I ask you something. what would it be if you decided to. uh, if there was a situation where you had to."
I had open-heart surgery before. it's not going to do it.
mm-hmm.
"the prostate cancer, it didn't."
"all right, so let's go"
I'm not sure. I'm not really sure. I'm not really interested in it.
mm-hmm.
I'm just-I'm just-
"so, you're something that's-you-you-you-you"
- - I- I- I- I
-you're pretty much doing what you want to do.
"yes, a minute, a minute. yes."
"yes. all right, all right, all. I'm really grateful you're willing to talk about it. you don't want to pursue this. shall I tell you something else in the next visit. because I know you said you didn't want to talk, but I'm worried."
"all right, all right, all right,. I'd like to go. I-I, uh, I'm always open to. you know, I'm listening. yes."
if I'm not talking too much?
yes. [laughing]
"all right, all right, all. [chuckles]"
"[unintelligible 00:03:34] Options. ""why do I keep you as a patient?"" Said the surgeon."
"well, I'm thinking of something"
"he's good, but he's good. [laughing]"
do you think he'll be a doctor?
yes.
yes. we'll work with you wherever you are.
"all right, all right, all"
thank you for taking a minute and talking about smoking.
"thank you, doctor."
"all right, all right, all"
"all right, all right, all"
"Jean, I'm glad you're back."
"hello, doctor. I'm sorry. I"
what's changed since last week?
"all right, I've done what we've agreed to. I've done the diary for you."
"all right, all right, all"
"-I tried to mark the difference between smoking and smoking, and I was more aware of it when I wanted to stop smoking."
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
"-and I'm fine with it. the weekend was a little scary because, uh, uh, the urge was still coming."
sure.
-to smoke.
sure.
"I've cut at least two or three cigarettes a week, and that's just in one week. so-so-so-so"
so you've been smoking two or three cigarettes. it's amazing that you're doing this. given how much you smoke.
yes.
"so, you've got the diary, right?"
"yes, I'm sure."
"you've done it, and you've really focused on the delay in cigarettes. so it went well. so what do you think things aren't going to be?"
it's just gotten worse since the weekend.
"all right, so let's go"
I've been out with friends and I've been home a lot of the day.
yes.
-instead of working. it was really hard to stop the urge.
"all right, all right, all. you have problems when you socialize, and you have time, really, to deal with them."
"yes, I'm sure."
"-uh, and you noticed that the others were more difficult?"
"but I've marked it in the book. I said it to myself, I'm telling you the truth."
"it's going to mark him down, okay."
"so, I'll have to be really careful about the weekend. maybe I'll be busy on the weekend, or maybe I'll join a group or something."
"all right, all right, all. you thought about what you might do, like a hobby. do you have any ideas about what you might do to help you?"
if I can postpone it for a minute-
"all right, all right, all"
"""all right, I won't be home-and-and I'm not going to be home-and-"
"all right, so let's go"
-I'll take it when I'm working or on my way to work.
"all right, so let's go"
because I-I-I-I-I-I-
sure.
then I'd like to try not smoking in my house.
"all right, all right, all. what do you want to do next time you come to see me?"
I'd like to do what I've done this week. I'd like to mark it down.
"all right, so you're going to continue."
"I've been smoking for a week, and I'm smoking two cigarettes a day."
sure.
"in other words, I'd like to smoke five cigarettes a day."
"all right, all right, all"
"well, I smoke a big pack and a small pack."
you've been smoking five cigarettes this time.
"yes, I'm sure."
do you have any ideas about what concretely you can do?
I'll try to count every day.
"all right, so let's go"
"when I'm tempted to let it go, fight it, and maybe not smoke until the next impulse."
"all right, so let's go. [unintelligible 00:02:58]"
"so, if I'm between two of them-"
sure.
and I'm really glad you came back and talked to me.
sure.
-listen to it with your friends.
when would you like to talk about it?
"I'll be back in a week, and it's all new and I'll be fine."
"absolutely. all right, all right, all"
"all right, doctor, thanks."
"all right, all right, all. so, in a week, we'll see you."
"yes, thank you."
can I help you with something?
"I'm hoping so. I just got a smoke-free workplace. I don't-I don't really like it. I'm smoking, but I'm wondering if there's anything that could help me in the day. after work, you're going to smoke a cigarette and have a beer."
"you've got a smoke-free workplace, aren't you?"
"no, no, no, no. I won't stop smoking. I'm really happy with it. it's going to help me relax. well, I'm not sure what the big deal is."
"all right, all right, all. tell me a little about how smoking is in your life. it will help you -"
"I'm smoking a little less than a pack. it wasn't too bad. I smoked for five years, but I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I"
"all right, all right, all. smoking is a very important part of your life right now. you don't want to change anything, but if you decide to quit, you feel pretty confident that you can handle it."
sure. I'm done with it. I'm done
"all right, all right, all. what's so confident about you?"
"but I don't see why I couldn't, I-- although I've never tried to quit, but I'm just. you know, I'm just. you know, I'm just. you know, I'm just. you know, I'm"
"mm-hmm. so, uh, uh, in terms of, uh, uh, readiness to actually try to quit, where do you think you're at 1 to 10?"
I'm probably two. I'm not gonna quit smoking until today's big announcement at work.
"all right, all right, all. why two instead of one?"
everything can happen. maybe I'll be convinced. yes. do you want to try something that would make me want to quit smoking?
"now, there's a lot of products that can help you stop smoking. we have products that can help you replace nicotine, which can help reduce withdrawal symptoms that you may experience when quitting or cutting down and also some medicines that your doctor may prescribe."
"all right, all right, all. all right, that's good information. I'm not gonna do anything today. I'm just looking for options, but that's encouraging. I have at least a couple of tools to help me quit smoking."
sure. you said you were two. what would it take to move you to 4 or 5?
"I'm not sure. I guess if my friends, like if one of my friends decided to quit, it would help, but I don't think so."
sure. I'm wondering if there will be people who plan to quit work when your workplace is smoke-free.
that's a good point. I didn't really think about it. that's a good idea. yes.
"all right, all right, all. you seem to be here for information. if you decide to go, I'll help you pick up the products you choose."
"all right, all right, all. thank you very much."
"so, what's the point of this, Bob. what can I do to help you?"
"yes. well, I'm here because my wife thinks I'm smoking. she smoked for six months, and she thought she was going to kick it, right. everyone who smokes is bad. well, that's why I'm here to please her, so she can go."
"you don't want to be here, so you don't. you don't want to do this afternoon."
"yes. it's a little exaggerated. I'm supposed to be working, too, right. so-so-so-so"
"you took a little time off, and you've lost money and time."
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. you know, my wife forced me to come. she was just nagging me for six months, and she was still smoking, and I had to quit."
"Bob, what do you think your wife is worried about smoking?"
she's worried about my health and she's cutting out the newspaper about smoking and.
"wow, she showed you and made you read."
"yes, I have to read it. we used to go out and have a cigarette together at breakfast. I'm going out in this weather, you know. she's smoking more than me now, and she's more than a little?"
you're really pissed off about it. it's pretty shocking that you have to change your life for six months because of a decision she made six months ago.
"they're against me, my son and my daughter, they're like, they're against me."
"so, from your perspective, do you see any consequences of smoking?"
"of course, the biggest thing is how my wife and I are affected. he's still smoking like my father. yeah, sometimes I thought about it, but I mean, I don't know. I'm not sure if I can-- I don't know if I'm gonna stop."
"so, I'll try to understand the whole thing because there's a lot of things to it. your wife is on the phone and your kids are on the phone. you're isolated, you're in a corner, and you're told you have to do it."
yes.
"you're concerned about your health, but it's not the main factor. it seems like it would be best if things were just like they were before she stopped smoking and everything was fine. that's pretty much what it is -?"
yes. yes. I don't want to lose my family or my family.
I'm sure you have a very important relationship with me. you're gonna do anything to do it.
"we've been married for 25 years, and we haven't had any problems. as such-- as such is the first problem. it's not a problem, but it's a problem, like if we smoke, but we're both smoking, so it's like we're going to be like this, like if we keep smoking, but it's like we're going to be like"
"it seems like everything is or nothing to me. you smoke, you keep smoking, and things are going downhill, and your wife is more and more on your case, or you'll be smoking. it's almost like one or the other. I think it's going to take a long time to learn how to smoke and maybe it's going to take a while to learn how to stop smoking."
"so, I'm actually going to do it like a gradual taber?"
we can use some of the medication and some other approaches. you have to recognize that it's going to take a while and practice to get where you want to be.
"I'd like to go to my wife today, but she's got a little bit of a headache. so she could come to the future appointment or something?"
I'd be happy to talk to both of you if you wanted to go with your wife.
"all right, all right, all. I'll talk to her tomorrow, so I'll see you tomorrow, and we'll make something up."
"all right, all right, all. it's going to be good."
"all right, let's go. Let"
thank you for coming.
"all right, all right, all. thank you."
"hello, Carrie, thanks for coming."
"thank you, doctor."
what's the point of your arrival?
I've been smoking and trying to quit smoking.
so you want to give up the cigarettes?
for years I wanted to.
"so, uh, so, uh, so, uh, so, uh, so, uh, so, uh, so, uh, so, uh, so, uh, so, uh, so, uh,"
"I'm against it with my daughter. I have asthma, I have bronchitis, I have a hard time breathing, and I'm not even getting younger."
as a leper in a leper colony.
"in fact, it's like being a leper in a non-leper colony."
"because there's no longer a leper colony. well, um, so it's important that you're a good mom."
"all right, so let's go"
"-and a model for your daughter who's 15, so she's a little older than she would be at 15."
"well, she's expressed, you know, she's like shhhh and it's embarrassing for her friends and, um, and in the end, it's embarrassing for me."
"all right, all right, all. you want to look good, you know, and she's proud of you. yes."
"all right, all right, all right, all"
"and then you mentioned a lot of things about medical problems. you've mentioned asthma, um, acute bronchitis."
"and emphysema, the first stage of emphysema."
"oh, my God. all right, all right, all. I'm sorry to hear that, and that's really scary, I'm sorry to hear that."
thank you. Thank you. Thank you
tell me about when you were diagnosed.
"I remember when my daughter was five, um, I had a problem with humidity."
mm-hmm.
"-I tried to breathe, and, um, I wanted to breathe."
mm-hmm.
my daughter was so scared she ran to my neighbour's house and called the police.
a smart girl.
"yes-yes, she's very intelligent. I was in my robe and my daughter was in a panic, and she was 15, so she was worried about losing me."
mm-hmm.
"-unsuccessfully, uh, uh, uh, uh,"
tell me a little about what happened to the Chantix.
"well, um, I'm not sure if it's my lack of willpower, but, uh, I've had a bad side effect."
mm-hmm. mm-hmm. what if you're willing to talk about what side effects -
I've had nightmares about it -
mm-hmm.
-nausea - nausea - nausea - nausea
mm-hmm.
"-um, stomach pain, and nausea. yes."
"really, really. Carrie, I heard that people, especially those you know, are really successful, but when they have adverse reactions, they are really pronounced, like the ones you just described."
"well, I didn't stop smoking, so I'm happy to say that."
you want the good [crosstalk]. how long have you been?
it's been a couple of years.
"all right, all right, all right, all"
I've done it a couple of times.
"all right, all right, all"
"I'd think, ""Oh, I'd like to try it this time."""
mm-hmm.
and I've had friends who've done it-
mm-hmm.
"you can go to the support group, or call"
"all right, all right, all"
-but I'm not doing anything but-
mm-hmm.
-um -um -um -um
you're not going to do the internet.
"no, no, no, no. yes."
"all right, all right, all. you tried it, and it wasn't really good for you, like you didn't really listen to what your body was telling you."
and it's really hard to be.
yes.
"you know, um, you know, um, you know, um, you know, um, you know, um, you know, um, you know, um, you know, um, you know, um, you know, um, you"
"you don't have to do anything else, so you're looking for something to relieve you, not something to make you feel worse."
"all right, exactly."
"you've been smoking for a long time, haven't you ever been able to quit?"
when I was in the hospital. [chuckles]
"all right, all right, all"
"you know, I've been smoking, you know."
"all right, all right, all. how long have you been smoking without cigarettes?"
I'd say three days.
"it's been three days since I've been there. I mean, I've been smoking for a long time, and I feel like it's a long time since I haven't smoked."
"I couldn't smoke, but I was in a situation where I couldn't smoke."
you've been forced to-
"all right, so let's go"
-not smoke?
mm-hmm. yes.
what did you notice when you didn't smoke?
I'm thinking about smoking constantly.
mm-hmm.
"as a chocoholic, he wants chocolate."
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
-I've been looking for a cigarette.
you're [unintelligible 00:06:04]
"yes, exactly. mm-hmm. yes. I didn't care if I smoked my brand or anyone else's brand, I just wanted to smoke."
"all right, all right, all"
the nicotine addiction is the addiction.
"all right, so let's go"
"I want a cup of coffee, I want a cigarette."
mm-hmm.
"if I'm stressed, I smoke a cigarette."
mm-hmm.
"well, just cigarettes. um, I think it's always a problem with a duel -"
mm-hmm.
-you know-you know-you know
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
-I think so.
"well, it's a lot of good for you."
mm-hmm.
"it's like a cigarette and a cigarette. ""how do I have a cup of coffee without cigarettes?"""
mm-hmm.
"well, actually, yes, that's true, it's a-- I think it's a combination of a lot of things. in a lot of ways, it's a very good drug, and it's really good for you, um, because you're describing it very accurately. and-and-and-and"
really?
"-he'll do what you need him to do. the downside is-is it-is, it's going to be a long-term health problem."
"yes, I'm sure."
it will take a minimum of ten years of your life.
"""put another nail in the coffin,"" my aunt said."
"all right, all right, all. what do you think she's telling you?"
"""oh, Aunt Kathy, you've been my role model, and I've been looking at you and thinking about you, and I've been thinking about you, and I've been thinking about you, and I've been thinking about you, and I"
it's a beautiful thing. It's a great
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. and that's what I've been associated with since then and now I'm almost ostracized."
mm-hmm.
"so, it's a double-edged sword."
"and that's really true, 20 years ago, it wasn't like that."
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
it's not like that 30 years ago.
mm-hmm.
"so, smoking has become more difficult. you're smoking a cigarette and people assume you're a smoker."
you're going to travel 10 miles.
mm-hmm.
-to smoke a cigarette. you don't have to say you're in a situation and you'll only have 15 minutes.
mm-hmm.
"you can't even smoke, you have to go back in a minute, like, seven minutes, and you'll be back."
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
-I smoke a cigarette in five minutes.
all right-all right. so - so - so - so
"I've heard a lot of people say if I quit smoking, I'll gain weight."
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
"it's not good food, but it's much better."
mm-hmm.
-if you stop smoking.
mm-hmm.
the downside is I'm going to gain weight.
mm-hmm.
"so I'm going to have a new wardrobe, but I can't afford it."
"all right, all right, all. you see it as part of your life right now. for 18 years, it's been part of your life."
mm-hmm.
"you've become a more important part of your life because you've been smoking a lot of times, and you've been thinking about never smoking."
"all right, so let's go"
"yes. you're worried if you stop, you'll gain weight. I hear a list of things that don't feel so good about stopping."
mm-hmm.
I wonder what else is on the list.
"well, I'm withdrawing."
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
"they say it's terrible. well, I'm a little cranky."
mm-hmm.
I hope my friends understand what I'm trying to do and support me.
"mm-hmm. all right, all right, all. yes. the other list is also added to the list of withdrawals."
mm-hmm.
"-that's a shame. all right, all right, all. what else would be good about smoking?"
"I think smoking is bad, but I've smoked so long. I'm not sure-I don't think I can-"
mm-hmm.
-not smoking in your life.
mm-hmm.
I'm supposed to stop. I don't have any health problems from smoking.
mm-hmm.
"-as of now, but when the doctor told me what I'd be waiting for-"
mm-hmm.
I've reconsidered that-that's why I'm
"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry"
everything.
thank you for coming.
"yes, I'm sure."
how do you feel about today?
"actually, I'm really happy."
"yeah. all right, all right, all"
yes.
"all right, all right, all"
I'm feeling good. I'm feeling good
"you've done your clarifications, you've done your value-"
yes.
-and what's the best five?
"yes, I'm sure. it was a good experience for me. it's different, but it's not like. it's not like usual. I've been thinking a lot about self-respect, and I've been thinking a lot about the number one thing I've been thinking about. I don't even know if I've ever been in the top five, let alone the number one."
really?
"yes. and, uh, and, uh, and"
do you know why it's like that?
"I'm thinking, I think, why it is. I've been thinking a lot lately, and I've been thinking a lot about what happened recently and what I've learned, and I've always taken care of other people. I've been thinking about it, almost not even thinking about it. at the time, I was a little sad. I didn't realize how serious it was, but I'm glad I realized it."
I'm sure.
-and I'm thinking of myself as much as I have other people. I'm sure it's important. I'm a better person when I'm doing it.
mm-hmm. you don't want to put yourself on the back burner?
yes.
yes.
"I'm stressed, I'm stressed, I'm stressed, I'm stressed, I'm stressed, I'm stressed, I'm stressed, I'm stressed, I'm stressed,"
mm-hmm.
I'm not the best I can be.
"for someone else, for someone else?"
yes.
for your family's sake?
"either way, I'm with myself or someone else."
"you think it's so important that you put yourself on the back burner, or that you've neglected yourself, or that you've neglected yourself?"
"I was worried about what other people might think, and I was thinking about what they might think, and I was worried about what they might think. instead of letting my values determine my actions, I've let what I want to do to determine my actions."
"wow, that's really cool."
"I've done it for so long, I've never even known I did it."
you have a lot of your. Part of your paradigm?
"yes, yes, yes."
you're not even aware sometimes.
"I don't know anything about it. I didn't know. I'm completely unaware. I'm completely unaware of it, of course. I feel like it's a celebration for me. I've been thinking about my childhood and all the things I didn't have, and I'm thinking about how I feel like I've been thinking about it, and I'm. I feel like I've been thinking about it, and I'm. I. I'll be able to speak. I'll give you an opinion. if I want, I'll survive. no one will stop me, only me."
yes.
so I'm going to do it.
I didn't feel guilty for saying it for the first time.
the first time you've ever been?
"I'd say so, yeah. I've never told anyone before, and I'm not sure if I'm guilty of it. [chuckles]"
it's not a selfish thing.
no-no-no-no
"all right, so let's go"
"-it's not, it's really not."
"all right, that's great."
yes.
"yes. and so you've been thinking about this change, and how do you feel about it?"
"I'm happy to be happy. it's a joy for me. I'm hopeful that it's going to be okay. it's like I'm counting, like I'm important. I feel like I'll be able to do what I want, and I'm not afraid of anything, and I'm more excited about it, and I'm more passionate about it, and I'm less worried about it."
because you feel like you have to.
"you know, it's a sense of obligation, not just a sense of passion. I'm completely out of my passion. I'm happy to, I feel like I'm back in my head. it's like I've lost my way and now I'm back, yes, I remember why I wanted to do it or why it's important to me."
"yes, it's on the top five."
"number two, inner harmony. as a result, I feel like I need to harmonize with others before I can be harmonious with others."
you're gonna be happy with yourself?
"yes, and I'm happy to take care of my family."
it's very nice.
"well, when I'm at peace with myself, it's automatically going to contribute to my family's happiness. I'm bringing my family down when I'm unhappy."
sure.
I'm angry with them when I'm not respected and I'm just giving my family a say.
you're angry with yourself.
"when I'm in the mode, I'm really pissed off. I'm not interested in what you're saying, ""I'm a family member and I deserve it."""
"all right, so let's go"
"I'm a teacher and I'm a teacher, and I'm a teacher, and I'm a teacher, and I'm a teacher, and I'm a teacher, and I'm a teacher, and I'm a teacher, and I'm a teacher. I'm a teacher and I'm a bad teacher. I could still be a teacher, I could show up, I could do a really bad job, and I'd probably be able to stay, but I'd probably be able to do it."
"all right, so let's go"
but I'm not feeling very well about it.
you're not satisfied with your life.
"no, no, no, no"
you've done something useful to you.
"all right, all right, all right,"
you've come and you've given it up.
"I don't want to show up and get my paycheck. I don't think so, I don't think so, I'm not sure what it's going to be like. it's not just about looking good or to exhaust myself or to do what I want, but to really give something useful, something real."
it's a good thing.
"yes, it's meaningful, even if it's a little."
sometimes it's just a little thing.
yes.
"all of this is now, at this point in your life, like it's a healthy change, like what you're doing now."
yes. yes.
do you feel like there's something like a top five or something similar to the other top five?
"well, I'm really surprised by the fact that, uh, creativity and freedom are high on this list. in fact, it's not even in the top five. I've been in the top 12."
uh-uh.
"but I think if I have inner peace and self-respect, I can be more creative and have more freedom. when I explain everything and I'm not paying attention to myself, it's part of what's binding me, part of what's taking my freedom. when I'm stressed, I'm thinking about my creativity, and I can't even hear myself. I'm not even thinking about it. how can you be creative if you don't even know yourself?"
"all the chatter, all the chatter, all the"
"yes, exactly, the creativity is in the silence, the silence. it's literally - I'm just going to be quiet for a minute. it's amazing how quickly I can come to the idea that I'm stressed out, and I can't even think of how I'd be able to solve it"
thank you very much for the information.
"thank you, thank you for listening."
I came here because my mom wanted me here.
mm-hmm.
"I'm not really interested, but whatever."
I have it.
"she found my stash, uh, she found my stash."
uh-huh.
"she was scared, and she was crazy. I'm not why she's doing it, but I'm here."
mm-hmm.
I met a new cool crowd.
mm-hmm.
"uh, and that's-and that's what it is."
"yes. you have a new group of friends and-and, uh, you're really enjoying it. mom found your stuff and found your stash, and it's just turned into a mess."
yes.
yes.
"in fact, it's pretty much the same"
yes.
mm-hmm.
you seem to be pretty upset with your mom.
I'm here. I'm here.
yes.
I'm not sure why she's my stuff.
"all right, so let's go. it's like your house and. it's. it's. it's. it's your stuff."
"I'm not going to her, I'm not going to her. I'm not going to her purse. I'm not. I'm not. I"
yes. why should she go through yours?
"all right, so let's go"
"yes. yes, yes, yes,"
I've been exhausted all night.
so you said you had a bad night?
"yes, I'm sure. I don't understand it, she's eating three hours."
"you really had to eat every three hours last night, right?"
"yes, I'm sure. when I was a month old, my mom said I was sleeping through the night."
"well, I'm thinking of something. you've been expecting Lilly to sleep through the night, right?"
what's normal for a baby?
hello. Hi. Hi. Hi
"hello, Deborah. Hi, Deborah. how's it going today?"
"all right, I'm doing really well."
you've done a Value Clarification Sheet. do you want to talk about something you found?
"well, I'm really enjoying it, and, uh, I-I rated health as my first."
so you're the first one?
"-uh, the price. well, I'm really interested in physical and mental health, um, spiritual, emotional health. I guess everything is a package. I work on a certificate to become a fitness instructor. there's a program that extends the program. I've been doing it for five weeks. I'm supposed to go to the final exam tomorrow. I guess it's a little tense, but I'm looking forward to it, and I'm waiting for the results. so, I've been working for an internship."
mm-hmm.
"well, it's a little exciting, but I have a different career. it's boring to work in an office for so long."
"so, as far as you're a former employee, you're a health care provider, which is a little pushing you into a new direction. you do something you really want to do."
"yeah, I'm really active. I'd like to do something like that, but I don't. I'm pretty good at the game, but I don't think I'd be able to coach anyone, but I'm pretty good at the game."
"you've done it a couple of times, haven't you?"
"yes, I've done it."
and then you've always been the healthiest?
"he was in the top. it's there, yes. I don't remember if it's always been the first. I'm sure it was in the top three. yeah, I guess I've had problems with inner harmony, so I guess I'm not. I'm going to number two this time."
number two is the inner harmony?
"it's funny how it's not in the top 12. but then I remembered something, something, something, something, something, something, something, something, something, something, something, something, something, something, something, something"
mm-hmm.
"well, I'm more important, or at least on the list of values."
"so, what about the inner harmony part of your life?"
"yes. I've been thinking a lot about it, since I've been practicing yoga, and since I've learned to teach yoga. I'm more comfortable with myself in the quiet times, and if I'm meditating."
mm-hmm.
"well, I feel really good about myself."
"so, yoga is based on the number two, right. that's what it's about?"
"yes, it's part of it. well, I'm not gonna please anyone else. putting yourself first doesn't mean you're selfish. I've always tried to make other people happy, and I'm trying to do it, and I'm trying to do it, and I'm trying to do it, and I'm trying to do it, and I'm. ""you know, it's a good thing for a good person to do that. and then there's a time for it. you want to help people, and you say, ""Well, I don't have to be so important."". it's okay if it's a little bit of a break. if you know you don't really do anything bad to yourself, you know you don't really do anything bad. ""well, I'm helping you a lot, and I'm happy to do it."""
mm-hmm.
"you know, ""I have to do this."""
"yes, yes, yes, yes. in fact, the second, third, and fourth were about how you felt before. you know, it's a problem, you know, like, how can you be so selfish, and you think about yourself?"
mm-hmm.
"-you know, self-confidence and self-esteem are based on self-confidence and self-esteem, and you know, self-confidence and self-esteem."
love for yourself.
-love for yourself.
"yes, mm-hmm, yes. [crosstalk] And that's not selfish."
"it's not selfish. It's just a question of. you feel like you can help, you can help others, if it doesn't hurt you. it's true. It's true."
"yes, I'm sure. yes. well, then, but also, I really like helping others. you know, and if I'm there for someone else. I'm sleeping on the air mattress and my brother and his daughter and his granddaughter. my mom and my dad. my sister. my sister. my sister. my sister. my sister. my sister. my sister. my sister. my sister. my"
mm-hmm.
"I'm going to have a guest for one night, but I'll have a guest for two nights. I've been sleeping in my bed for days. [unintelligible 00:05:54]"
"even if it's a little inconvenient for me or my house, or my kitchen, or my kitchen, or whatever they don't pick up, it's okay. I'll survive. it's okay, it's not a big deal. yes. I'm really, uh-- I'm on my list and it's probably higher if I don't have them."
"but I like to learn and experience different cultures, and then I'm also around people who live in the community who are from other cultures. that's a lot of wisdom. and I'm also open to, uh, differences. if something happens in Congress or the Senate, it's going to be a little against my values, but if it happens, it's going to happen, and I have to deal with it and-and-and-be."
in the sense that you're saying what you're saying.
"all right, so let's go. mm-hmm."
"you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,"
yes.
"you learn the differences between cultures, and you learn to be wise."
"yes, I'm sure. school education and outside the classroom. there's a lot of wisdom in the place where I spent two months in the summer, in different Native American communities. oh, my God, it's fun, it's fun, it's fun,"
mm-hmm.
"-joy. - Enjoyment. - Enjoyment. it's intertwined with a lot of things. it's fun to learn about other people, other cultures. the inner harmony is fun. life was a big thing. it's about experiencing pleasure. yes."
it's a pleasure to be your number five.
yes.
"all right, all right, all"
"and I know it's going to be painful, disappointment, disappointment, and I'm also happy to accept it."
mm-hmm.
it's true that it doesn't always have to be happy. I- I'm gonna be a little disappointed sometimes.
mm-hmm.
"I'm gonna be disappointed, I'm gonna be hurt."
you took it into consideration that-
absolutely.
-Life can happen to you.
mm-hmm. yes.
"it seems like you're writing a story. as far as your health and the number two are concerned, it's a little bit of a draw. number three, the third one. uh - - - - - -"
the inner harmony of the whole.
"number two was the inner harmony, and it allowed you to help others or serve-service."
"all right, so let's go"
"you know, not to do anything for anyone else. as far as you said, you didn't want to find any problems with helping others. and that's when the service is number three or four, which is wisdom. I see the world in a different way, and I'm happy to learn different cultures and I see the world in a different way. one day you will be disappointed, but you will find joy and joy"
yes.
"all right, I'm glad you're talking to me."
it's nice to be here and listen to me. it was okay to encourage me.
"all right, all right, all"
