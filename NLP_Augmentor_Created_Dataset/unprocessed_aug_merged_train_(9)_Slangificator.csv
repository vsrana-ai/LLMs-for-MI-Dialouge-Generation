(9)_Slangificator
"Molly, thank you so much for coming over and yakking with me today."
You're welcome.
"Yeah, I appreciate it. So, um, uh, your mom had given me a call and said that, um, um, there were some problems with kids kinda given you problems at school and being mean and thangs like that, and, uh, that's a hurtful thang."
Yeah. I stayed home two times already from school just 'cause of the bullying and everything.
"That's a- that's a lot of school to, yeah, and, you know--"
"And as I was out of school like more rumors started to happen as I was out of school. I come back and like these rumors are going around about me. Like one time when I stayed home, supposedly, I was in the principal's office the whole day and I had security guards like escort me to classes which that was not true 'cause I was home the whole time."
People like to make up jackanories.
I've been getting blamed ever since like fifth or sixth grade about with every single thang that's going on.
"For, like why do you think, wh-what kinds of-"
"I think because the kids-- 'cause I like to nag on thangs. Like when peeps tell me thangs, I like to like talk more like with the bod instead of just leaving it be, and I think the kids that like blame me for everything say that I'm an wee buns target to like hit, to like talk about, it's like annoying."
"So it's, uh, so when you were talking about like nagging on, tell me a ickle bit more about, can you give me an example of what you mean?"
"If somebody says like, ""Oh, I heard this thang about you."" I go, ""Oh, really, what is it,"" and I just keep talking and like make thangs worse. Like, if somebody says that they wanna beat me up, I like go on, and say like, ""Okay, then hit me,"" and like I just don't leave it be, like I just don't walk away. I like stay there and like talk more."
"And-and what happens when you don't leave it be, what usually happens?"
"I think possibly more like talking more like it gets like bigger and bigger. It's just like if you stop it, then they don't know what to say, they-they're like, ""Oh, like she's walking away."" And like that stops everything but like if I talk it-it keeps building up and we both get in trouble-"
Okay.
-and like called down to the principal's office.
Okay.
-and get talked to.
"Okay, so and then what-what's it like for you after that, once you get spanked in the principal's office?"
"Well, usually I try telling myself to just like, leave it be-"
Mm-hmm.
"-but if somebody says something about me, it gets me potty 'cause like what the heck, like you're talking about me so like I try to stop but sometimes I just say like a few words. Like I think now I'm trying to get like better."
Mm-hmm.
"Like there's this one incident that somebody was talking to me, I just said like, ""Oh, wow, this is like really lame, like I'm just gonna leave,"" and I like let the conflab be."
That's pretty gnarly that you did that.
Yeah. I felt proud of myself.
"You should be proud of yourself, and how did you do that?"
"I was just like thinking of like when I'm- whenever I like I'm saying like stuff back, mom gets really potty at me, she's like, ""Well, I'm not gonna help you anymore."" 'Cause, she tells me to like leave it be, but I really don't lis-listen to her so she gets garrity. So I tried like thinking of like her feelings and like what would happen after if I say, ""This is lame, leave me alone,"" 'cause then they'll like stop and I won't get like yelled at anymore."
"Uh, that says a lot about you and your mom's relationship though that you can kind of put yourself in her chump and think about how she would feel about it."
Yeah.
"You know what I mean? It's pretty gnarly, not everybody can do that, so. So you could kind of put yourself ahead, uh, it's almost like watching a flicks ahead-"
Yeah.
-and knowing how it's gonna turn out.
"'Cause usually, if I get in pickle, mom gives me the schtum treatment that I don't like. It's like she doesn't talk to me, I'm like trying to talk to her, she don't like wheezing being like, uh, I don't like it."
"That's the worst, the schtum treatment."
Yeah.
"Yeah, so, um, so but that worked for you, where you just let it go, you thought about your mom, you like what we would call like, you channeled to your mom, you know, and, uh, channeling mom, and then, um, you were able to walk away, and you were proud of yourself and chuff-all diabolical happened."
Yeah.
Is that right?
Yeah.
Does it--
"Like they all like stopped talking to me, and the funny thang was that their eighth-graders that like didn't even go to my old school like I don't even know how they said of talking to me, I was like, creepy."
"Yeah, so- and so when you- when somebody else told you that they or peeps said you that you're an putzy target, um."
"Well, they don't really say that to me like I just like think that 'cause that's what I've like heard from my mom, and peeps talking to me 'cause I keep talking to them-"
Okay.
-so they keep coming back at me.
"Okay, so they-they kinda know how to hook you."
Mm-hmm.
-and reel you in-
Yeah.
"-right, and get you pissed off. And then diabolical thangs happen and then you get in hoo-ha."
Yeah. [chuckles] That happens a lot.
"Yeah. So, yeah. And it's, uh-- So, um-- so you-you know that when you're kind of channeling your mom, that helps. It sounds like you taught yourself almost. Like there's-"
Yeah.
-a conflab inside. What other baldy notions do you have about what you could do?
"I was thinking of like, um, if I'm like at school like a peep thangs are happening during class-"
Mm-hmm.
"-I just say, can I use the washroom or something to go like walk and like think of like how to like leave them be. And one time during my gym class, there's this girl that I had her like not talking early. And we're playing pickleball, I don't know if you know that, it's like a-"
I don't know what pickleball is.
"-it's like a badminton, big life-size ping pong ball game."
It looks like a pickleball?
"Yeah, you have like a big bracket—"
There's no pickle?
No.
Okay.
"No, [chuckles] there's no pick."
I wanted to pickle and stuff.
"Mm-hmm. And like I was supposed to be like again turn. I told my-- I went to my gym teacher like silently and said I can't be by this bod, can I move to the next court. So he like switched us around so I won't be by her. And that like happened."
That's a really gradeley decision.
The girls like what the heck like.
"Yeah. No, but how swish on your part to know that if you would- if you would had to play with her, something diabolical would've happened."
Yeah. Like I would like smacked her in the coupon or some- [laughs]
You knew that.
-or something.
Right? You knew that. So-
Yeah.
So you know actually which kids-
"Yeah, that's like—"
-know how to push your buttons that real you in.
"Yeah, there's like four main ones but not that like I can say who."
"That's okay. That's-- Yeah, 'cause it's not important. The important thang is for you to be chuffed. And, uh--"
"And the charvers that I have like I know are my true chums, They're like ones that don't really 'cause drama or like—"
Uh-huh.
"I mean, they might but like they're not like diabolical and they actually like help me. Like some of these girls that like so-called chums like-"
Uh-huh.
"-They're like they come to me saying like, ""Oh, did you really have to like punch this girl."" I'm like, ""No."" It's like you're not a charver if you'd actually believe that, you know what I mean?"
Yeah.
"Yeah, it's kind of annoying, 'cause it's kind of hard like going into high school and like knowing how to believe and who not to believe."
"Yeah. That's-- that-- it's-it's really big unknown territory. Pressure High School class is probably 1,000 kids."
"Yeah, 1,003."
"1,003 kids."
"And then there's the sophomores also that you have like another 1,000, so it's like—"
"2,000-"
Yeah.
"-potential enemies, charvers, who knows which ones."
"Yeah, with these like the first rumors had started going around about like my charver and I, and like I lost him just 'cause of rumors. It's like, what the heck. Like I couldn't get over him for like gosh, who knows, it was like three months and I finally just had got over him."
That must have been hard for you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"I was like really, you're probably just jel 'cause I was chums with him or something."
"Mm-hmm. So but finally after three months, time went by-"
Yeah.
-and you got--
I just found like other peeps and just like forgot about it.
Okay. And so how else do you identify who your charvers are that you can really trust who have your back?
"I say the ones that like not even that I've known the longest, but like the ones that actually hang out with me a lot, or like texting me a lot, or like calling. And the ones that are actually like that helped you before with like situations. And that they tell you stuff and they know they can trust you. Like one of my charvers tells me everything about her. And like that's how I know she's a canny fam 'cause she trusts me with thangs."
You trust her back then?
Yeah.
"Okay. Well, that makes a lot of sense that people-- it goes both ways."
Mm-hmm.
"You know. And, um-- So and for you, charvers that, um, kind of, um, give you the gawm that you'd like to have. Texting you-"
Yeah.
"-calling and you hanging out with you, and stuff like that, rather than pretending to be a friend-"
Mm-hmm.
-when you know maybe they're gonna--
"Yeah, that happens a lot with me with like a lot of charvers. Like this one bod like we've been fams since like-- Well, we were cuzes since fourth grade."
Mm-hmm.
"And like she just starts like lying and like just talking smack about me. And it's like, you're not a gradeley chum then. Like I thought you were a fam since you've been my cuz since our fourth grade."
Mm-hmm.
"And she just like causes a lot of drama now. And like she came- Like the charvers I met at high school, she came like into them like, you're not gonna know-- In college, you're not gonna know who to follow 'cause-- since you keep following with my chums, what are you gonna do in college like not being able to find your own fams? It's kind of annoying 'cause they're my cuzes and like I can't be by her and she comes to my pals. It's like-"
Mm-hmm.
"-get your own charvers, [chuckles] stop following me."
Mm-hmm. Wh-what don't you like about her?
She just lies a lot and like just starts dramas about me and I haven't even talked to her like since eight grade. We only went to school together and she just like makes me lose other charvers 'cause of the drama she starts
"Okay. So she sounds like she's, um--"
A nobody. I'm gonna say that. She's like—
Or-or not worth your time.
Yeah.
She's not worth your time. So what would it be like for you to really just spend time with the charvers that you know are really--
I do spend time with them. Like I hang out with them a lot.
Good. That's really gradeley. Yeah. And if-if you need like some extra support from them--
Ask for it. Yeah.
"Right, and what kind of thangs do you ask from them?"
"I just ask them like if I'm like gonna get like sent down to the principal's office for like something happening, I call them to come down to, like, support my, like, backup griff."
"'Cause they can do that. They can- they can kinda give you some, uh, griff like, uh, um-- they can give some accurate skinny, um, and back up your jackanory versus the other bod's jackanory."
Yeah.
"So, okay. So we're-- You know what? Um, it sounds like you actually have some pretty gradeley baldy notions about, um, how to handle this, and yet kids are-- I know kids-- actually, adults can be really mean too. But, um, I know in high school, i-it's really diabolical."
Yeah.
"So I'm wondering if, um, uh, if-if you wanted to, we could get together again and continue to talk 'cause you-you've got some gradeley baldy notions already. And I'm very open that if you wanted to bring any of your mustard cuzes in, that that would also be totes gnarly too."
Yeah.
So would that be something--
"Yeah, there's one charver that might wanna like talk about it."
Yeah.
"And she's really like-- she doesn't know, like, who to talk 'cause her mom is not always there for her."
Okay.
And so like she's like doesn't know where to go.
Yeah.
Like she doesn't know who to believe.
"Well, I would want this session though to be for you though, Molly."
Yeah.
"I mean I'm willing to see her too, you know."
Yeah.
It sounds like she really needs-- she'd like someone to listen to her.
Yeah.
"Yeah. So, um, we could maybe talk about some other ways of, um, helping, uh, deal with this because, um, it does sound like, um, peeps are, you know, just being plain old mean to you for no canny darn reason."
Mm-hmm.
"Yeah. And, um, so you'd be willing to come back and talk about it then? Okay. All right. And I just wanna let you know that I think that you're, um, really doing a gradeley job of-of, uh, dealing with how hard it is to be in high school, 'cause it is hard."
Yeah.
It is.
I've noticed that.
"Yeah. And it is hard, and-and I-I think it gets better. My experience was it got a ickle better. The freshman and sophomore year, you know."
Mm-hmm.
"But, um, anyway, I think you are hanging in there beautifully, and I love hearing that you're involved in swimming and some other thangs 'cause they must help connect you up with some pretty-- I would hope-"
Yeah.
"-[unintelligible 00:13:12] peeps. So okay, anything else? No? Okay. All right."
Mm-hmm.
Thank you.
"You did your values clarification handout, and that was part of what I wanted to go over with you today. I wanted to hear about your values and just talk to you a ickle bit more about that. Do-do you wanna tell me what some of your top five values are?"
"Yes, um, my top value is fam happiness, um, that's-"
That's number one?
"-that's number one to me, especially now. I usually do this values clarification sheet, like, every two to three months-"
Mm-hmm.
"-just to see if anything changed, and every time it has changed."
"Oh. So, right now fam value is the most important thang to you?"
Yes.
Fam happiness?
"Yes, it's the most important because it's a ickle lacking, so I know that that's something that is very important to me."
Okay. Would you like to talk more about that?
"Yeah. Um, I can just pretty much say that my fam hasn't been on one accord, so, like, if-- I feel like if we all just can fall in the middle, which I know everybody doesn't really follow that track. So, um, I think for my part, 'cause I can't change anybody, is to be more present and, um, just listen and understand my fam members, and-and be able to voice what I feel as far as how important fam happiness-happiness is to me."
"Mm. Because even though it's important to you, maybe they don't know it's important to you."
Yes.
Is that what you're saying? Yes?
Yeah.
And you want them to know?
"And I want them to know how important it is to me, especially now, and I do this, like I said, every two to three months just to see where I am."
Uh-huh.
"And, um, these totes are different from-"
Okay.
-what I usually pick.
Okay.
"Um, and then the second one I said is religion. Um, it was number one at first, um, but somehow with a big situation that happened in my fam you kind of lose sight of your faith a ickle bit, which is bog-standard. And not a lot of people-- They, uh-- Well, in my church pad, i-it just seems like, ""Oh, you lost touch of God, oh my gosh, you're the devil."""
Uh-huh.
"You know? And it's kind of like, well we all face those challenges every day, we're not champion, you know? And I feel like my faith is still there but it's-- You know, as long as it's still there, that's all that matters."
"Right. So, right now, it really is important to you to put the fam values first? And religion is still very important to you, but you feel like maybe you're losing faith a ickle bit?"
"Yeah. I lost faith, and so I'm not yellow to say it."
Uh-huh.
You know? And once you say [unintelligible 00:03:12] peeps that don't really feel like that's—
Because you know that other peeps experience it too.
"Yeah, I know that."
"So, you know it's bog-standard."
I know that it's bog-standard.
But sometimes it's not something that peeps talk about.
"Yeah, well, it's a—"
Especially in the church.
"Yeah, it's like a shock to them when you say something like that. And it's like, ""Well, we all go through thangs where we're just not sure, and--"" I still have a ickle bit, I'm not saying that I'm off track, you know? I still have a ickle bit to go on. And the ickle bit that I do have are the positive thangs in my life that I look at and I'm like, ""Okay, well, I'm not in this situation, so I'm thankful,"" and-"
Mm-hmm.
"-you know, I'd still have faith to keep going on, but sometimes you feel as though, ""Where is God?"""
Yeah.
You know?
And it sounds like right now you're at a place of acceptance about that also.
Yes.
"Uh, that it's okay with you, and you-you know that it's gonna change because that's been your, uh, experience."
Yes.
You've done numerous values clarification handouts and every time they're different-
Mm-hmm.
-so you know that it's going to change.
Yeah.
And you accept that?
"I've accepted that. At first, I was like, ""Whoa,"" I think I was focused too much on the first time I did it-"
Mm-hmm.
-then the second time that I did it-- I did five of these total-
Mm-hmm.
"-but the second time that I did it I was so focused on, ""What did I read about last time?"" You know?"
Yeah.
"So, and I just went ahead and blanked that out and I just went and I-"
Yes.
"-compared and I was like, ""Oh wow."""
"I really applaud you for being open-minded nuff to realize that where you are now is not necessarily where you are, that you don't have to always have it be the same."
"Mm-hmm, and that's what I felt wasn't-- At first I was like, ""Is that not bog-standard?"" You know?"
Mm-hmm.
"But, I noticed peeps go through thangs every day. I go through thangs in life. Thangs are gonna change."
Mm-hmm.
"Thangs do not stay the same. Um, you know, like, you may be here, you're gonna go there, you're gonna go over there, not necessarily saying you're gonna fall down, but your view on life changes the more experience, the more life, every day-"
Yeah.
"-every day your eyes-- Well, to me, my mince pies have gotten broader, and broader, and broader. So—"
Right.
"I don't limit myself to change anymore, I just kind of fill it out, and then [unintelligible 00:05:38] I'm like, ""Okay."""
All right.
"That's gnarly, so I'll focus more on that, than on the unnecessary stuff in my life."
"Mm-hmm. Do you feel that there are some parts of your life where you'd like to be more in line with your values, or do you feel like you're really on target with them?"
"Um, I mentioned before that it was kind of, like, out of place for me, because when I did this one in particular, um, as-as-- I stated that there were-- The other three were important to me, but I haven't focused on it so I'm like, ""Okay, it's important to me,"" so I lost track of that and the other three—"
The other three?
"Um, number three was health."
Mm-hmm.
"Number four is inner harmony, and number five is security."
"Inner harmony, health, and security-"
Yes.
-are the other three?
Mm-hmm.
And the top two are fam happiness and religion?
And religion.
"Okay, and the three- the three other ones, inner harmony-- Let me see if I can remember them. Inner harmony, health and, what was the other one?"
Security.
Security.
Yeah.
"Inner harmony, health, and security."
Yeah.
You feel like you're not really paying as much gawm to them as you would want to?
"Yeah, because when I saw it I was like, ""Okay, yeah, that's one, that's one, and that's one."""
Mm-hmm.
But—
Is it because a lot of your time is being taken with the first two or?
"A lot of my time is being taken with, um, number one especially-"
Mm-hmm.
"-and, uh, I learned about the different way of looking at self-esteem."
Mm-hmm.
-and I've been totes esteeming others.
Uh.
"So, I've had, um, less time to have some inner harmony."
"Oh yeah, right. The fam has been so much coming first that you have sort of taken a back seat?"
Yes.
You're not even on-- Are you on the schedule at all? Meaning of time in a day dedicated? Is most of it going to your fam?
"Most of it goes to everything else, but me."
Okay.
"And, uh, like, I don't even—"
It's gonna be hard to achieve inner harmony-
Yeah.
-if you're always running around taking care of everybody.
And I feel like inner harmony first comes with kip. [laughter] I haven't been able to sleep lately.
Right.
"But, um-"
Yeah.
"-I think that's the first step, but I just, like-- Oh my gosh, I'm just overwhelmed, um, but I would like to gain that back, inner harmony, inner peace-"
Okay.
"-because when I was, you know, 18 I was just so, like, buckshee-spirited, open-minded. I was living life, now that I look at it, as a fairy tale."
Mm. Mm-hmm.
"And so I got knocked to reality and reality said, ""This is not a fairy tale."" Um, you're now on board. Like—"
Okay.
"And so I felt like, ""This is not about you, you know, this is about everyone else."""
"Mm. So, something dramatic happened?"
Yeah.
That kind of shocked you out of that fairy tale life-
Mm-hmm.
-and into a take care of everyone else thang?
Yeah-
Okay.
"-definitely, and the shock just keeps getting."
"Okay. Well, I really enjoyed having the time to be able to sit down and talk to you about your values. I hope that it's been helpful to you, and in the future, if I can support even any way in helping some of those other values get a ickle bit more gawm, we can talk about that next time."
Thank you for listening.
Okay. All right? You're welcome.
Mr. Johnson?
Yeah?
"Uh, I'm here to talk to you about, uh, your cholesterol and the, um, medicine your quack prescribed."
"Uh, I talked with my quack about my medicine. That's his job."
"But well, it's my job too, uh, to-to help you understand how to use your medicine and, uh, give you griff about getting the most benefits from it."
"Well, to be honest with you, I'm not even certain I'm going to take the medicine. Now, I know I got high cholesterol, I've got to get that down, but on the other spud, this medicine can cause some severe muscle weakness and I just can't afford that. I'm a truck driver and I haul those heavy boxes in on the dollies and I just can't afford that, so you know."
"So your-your-your quack told you that if your cholesterol remains elevated, you're at punt of stroke or heart attack?"
"Yeah, down the line, but-"
"Okay. Well, the-the side effect is something that's very, very rare, it's not really something you need to worry about, and the punt of stroke or heart attack is much worse."
"Well, right now it's the muscle weakness that-that I'm stuffed about, and that's, uh, you know, that's the prezzie, uh, I've got to do my job."
"Well, I-I-I understand that. Um, but like I said, it's very rare. If you feel some muscle weakness, you'll let your quack know. It's not permanent, okay? Yeah, it won't get to the blood- it won't get to the point where it affects your job—"
"Well, you know- why don't you just give me the medicine, I'll take it home and I'll think about it? But you know, I'm worried about my job."
"You- you really need to take it, and-and like I said, the-the muscle weakness is rare. If you feel muscle weakness, just let your quack know. He can take you off or switch. It's not permanent."
Sure. Fine. Just—
It's-it's not permanent.
Whatever.
"Okay? So a stroke or heart attack is much worse, so make sure you go ahead and pick up your medicine as you're on your way out and, uh, one-one every day to get your cholesterol down."
"Okay, sure. Fine."
Okay.
"Hello, Kaylie. It looks like you're here to pick up a prescription today."
Yeah. My quack said he called something in.
Okay. It looks like cholesterol statin. Do you know how you're supposed to take the medication?
"No, not really."
"Well, you just take it once a day. Did he tell you what side effects to expect?"
No.
"Well, some of the common ones are nausea, vomiting, headache. There are some severe ones like dermatomyositis, liver failure, lupus, rhabdomyolysis, hemorrhagic cerebral infarction. If you have any of those, just call your quack."
"Okay. Um, why am I taking this medication?"
"It's for your dyslipidemia. Oh yeah, just one tablet a day. Do you have any questions for me?"
"No, I guess not."
All right. Gnarly. Have a canny day.
"Hello, Kaylie. I see you're here to pick up a prescription today."
Yeah. My quack said he called something in.
"Oh, it looks like he called in cholesterol statin. Do you know how you're supposed to take this medication?"
"No, not really."
"Okay. Well, you take this one once a day. Did he tell you what side effects to expect?"
No.
"All right. Well, some of the common side effects are nausea, vomiting, headache. There are some severe side effects like dermatomyositis, liver failure, lupus, rhabdomyolysis, hemorrhagic, cerebral infarction. If you have any of those, you should call your quack."
"Okay. Um, so why am I taking this medication?"
"It's for your dyslipidemia. Oh, and you should take one every day. Do you have any questions for me?"
I guess not.
"All right. Gnarly. Well, have a canny avvy."
"Hello, Kaylie, I'm Lori, the pharmacist here at Bulldog Pharmacy. I see that you have a new prescription for cholesterol statin 20 called in by Dr. Ferris today. I wondered if you had a minute to talk to me. I just want to make sure that you know how best to take it, and if you have any questions."
Sure. I'm just getting a few groceries.
Okay. What did the quack tell you cholesterol statin is for?
"Well, he told me that I had a claret test for cholesterol, and that I should start taking this."
"He's right. This medicine is designed to help lower your cholesterol, and that means that it will help lower your punt of having a heart attack or a stroke. How did your quack tell you to take this medicine?"
He didn't really tell me. He just phoned it in.
"Okay. Well, you're going to take one tablet of cholesterol statin 20 one time a day by cake-hole, and you can take that with or without scran. When do you normally take your medications?"
"Well, I take all of my other medications right before I go to sack. So I guess I could take it then."
"Okay. That's champion because cholesterol statin works best if it's taken at night, though you can take it any time of the day. And you should take it every single day. It's important to keep that up. Where do you store your medications?"
"I store my medications, uh, in my nightstand, right by my sack."
All right. Do you have any chavvies in your drum?
No.
"Okay. Well, then that sounds like a champion location for you. Medicines keep best if they're stored away from light and heat and moisture. What did the quack tell you to expect in terms of side effects?"
He didn't mention anything about that.
"All right. Well, this medication is pretty well tolerated, which means it doesn't have very many side effects. But you might experience some mild muscle aches and pains. If they seem really severe to you, then you should call Dr. Ferris and talk to him about that. Also this medicine can interact with a lot of other medications, and even over the counter thangs. So check with the quack or myself before you start anything new. And lastly, grapefruit juice can interact with cholesterol statin 20. So if you use grapefruit juice every day, I probably would switch to a different juice while you're on this medication."
"Just so I know we're on the same page, can you repeat back to me how you'll take this medicine?"
"Sure. I'm just gonna take one tablet right before I go to sack with my other medications. And I guess I will switched to orange juice. And if I notice any muscle pain that is severe, I'll call Dr. Ferris right away."
"Gnarly, Kaylie. I know we went over a lot today. What other questions do you have for me?"
"Uh, I think you answered all my questions. Thank you."
"Mega. All right. Well, here's your prescription. I even put it on auto fill for you so that it will be filled for you every- at the same time every month. And if you have any other questions later, our phone number is right here on the bottle, and you can call me at any time. Thanks so much. Have a coolio day."
"Hello, Kaylie. I'm Lori, the pharmacist here at Bulldog Pharmacy. I see that you have a new medication to pick up today. Called in by Dr. Ferris for cholesterol statin 20. Do you have a minute to talk about it? I want to make sure that you know how best to take this medicine and to answer any questions that you might have."
Sure. I'm just getting a few groceries.
All right. What did the quack tell you cholesterol statin is for?
He told me that I had a claret test for cholesterol so that I should start taking this medication.
"All right, and he's right. This medication will help lower your cholesterol, and it will help lower your punt of having a heart attack or a stroke. How did the quack tell you to take this medicine?"
"He didn't tell me, he just phoned it in."
"All right. Well, you're going to take one tablet of cholesterol statin 20 one time a day by cake-hole, and you can take that with or without scran. When do you usually take your medications?"
I take all my other medications right before I go to sack. So I guess I could take it then.
"That's champion. This medication can be taken any time of the day, but it does work best if taken in the evening, and it's important to take it every day."
Where do you store your medications?
I store them all in the nightstand by my sack.
Do you have chavvies in your drum?
No. I don't have any kids.
"All right. So that sounds like a champion place for you to store those. Medications are best when they're stored away from light, heat and moisture."
What did your quack tell you to expect in terms of side effects?
He didn't mention anything about that.
"All right. Well, this medication is usually well tolerated, which means that it doesn't have very many side effects, but you might experience some muscle aches or pains. If they seem really severe to you, then you should call Dr. Ferris and talk to him about that. Also, this medication can interact with over-the-counter medicines or even other medications. So before you start something new, you should check with either Dr. Ferris or myself. And lastly, this medication can interact with grapefruit juice. So while you're taking this medicine, I would avoid grapefruit juice."
"Just so we know we're on the same page, can you repeat back to me how you are going to take this medicine?"
"Sure. I'm just gonna take one tablet of the cholesterol statin, uh, in the evening with all my other medications. And I guess I'll switch to orange juice. And if I notice any diabolical muscle pains, then I'll be sure to call Dr. Ferris right away."
"That's gnarly, Kaylie. I know we went over a lot today. What questions do you still have for me?"
I think you answered all my questions. Thank you.
"All right, gradeley. Well, here's your prescription. I even put it on autofill for you so it'll be ready at the same time every month for you. And if you have any questions later, our phone number is right here on the bottle, and you can call me at any time. Thanks so much. Have a coolio day."
"Hi, Dr. Martin. I heard you had a question for me. What did you want to talk about?"
"I'm sorry, but are you the pharmacist? I just had a question about citalopram."
"Yeah, I'm the pharmacist on duty. Citalopram, okay. It's an antidepressant and it comes in 10, 20, and 40-milligram strengths. It's excreted in the urine and it has a half-life of about 35 hours. For side effects, there are sexual side effects, heart side effects, and stomach side effects."
"Okay, but I just wanted to know if it interacts with phenelzine?"
"Oh, um, yeah, I think that should be hunky-dory."
"Okay, thanks for that. I have an appointment to run to."
"All right, thanks. Call me anytime."
"Hi, Mrs. Smith. I wanted to let you know that at this appointment, we're gonna be giving Lilly some vaccines."
"Oh, I-I don't know if I'm comfortable with that. I've been reading a bunch of stuff lately about them."
Hmm. Can you tell me more about your concerns about vaccines?
"Uh, yeah, well, I was just- I was reading that it's better to let them build up their immunity, like, natch and stuff in their immune systems."
"Okay, so you were thinking that maybe exposing Lily natch to these diseases would be a better choice than using vaccines to help her get stronger?"
"Well, yeah. I mean, I had chickenpox as a kid, and now I'm immune. Right? So."
"That's right. Having chickenpox as a chavvy means that you are less likely to have chickenpox as an adult because you've developed a-a natural immunity. Uh, but is it okay if I offer you a ickle bit more griff about the other vaccines that we're- we were going to give her Lily today?"
"Uh, okay."
"Okay. So, uh, before vaccines were developed, often when chavvies had a natural exposure to some of these diseases, they ended up with, uh, sometimes death, disability, measles caused brain damage and, uh, deafness and blindness. Polio caused, uh, paralysis in chavvies. And so, allowing chavvies to have natural exposure to these diseases, sometimes was a ickle bit of a punt, it could be dangerous."
"Wow, I didn't realize it was so dangerous. I've never heard of polio."
"Hmm. Some of these thangs I've mentioned to you, you're-you're not familiar with. Uh, and I think that's because we've done such a canny job of eliminating some of these diseases that a lot of peeps your age, and even my age, are unfamiliar with those thangs.  Um, so having shared this gen with you, what do you think about the baldy notion of vaccines for-for Lilly?"
"Uh, I guess it's okay. I mean, I just I want her to be healthy and safe."
It's really important for you to make sure that she's protected and that you make gradeley decisions and do your research before you make any medical decisions for her.
"Yeah, I just want to do what's right."
"Hi Mrs. Smith, my name is Terri, I'm one of the nurses who works with Dr. Fields."
"Well, I remember you. Yeah, we met once before."
"Yes, I think when you were in last time."
Yeah.
"And I know that, uh, Dr. Fields talked with you last time about maybe trying a tai chi class to see how that would go, and I wanted to-to check in with you and see how tai chi went."
"Well, I went once."
Uh-huh.
"Yeah and, um, it was very-very beautiful to see and the instructor was very canny, but I felt kind of self-conscious because I'm still in my walker."
Uh-huh.
"And I had to sit in the chair. I couldn't, you know, do what they were doing."
Mm-hmm.
"So, it's-- it was-- I simply felt self-conscious."
"Uh-huh. So, you thought it was beautiful and you liked the instructor, but you were a ickle self-conscious because you were in a chair?"
A lot self-conscious.
"A lot self-conscious, uh-huh."
Yeah.
"What were you hoping to achieve with the, um, by going to tai chi?"
"Well, like Dr. Fields told me, it helps with balance, and I'm still having the wobblies. So, I was really hoping that I could get to the point where I could benefit from what they had to offer. Um, yeah, mostly my balance, mostly my balance."
"Uh-huh. So, you're hoping that it would help with balance, but you didn't see the- maybe the results you were looking for?"
Not yet.
Not yet.
Yeah.
Uh-huh. What is your overall goal? What are you working towards?
I wanna go home.
Uh-huh.
"Yes, I really do."
"Mm-hmm, and what is it that's important to you about getting home?"
[sighs] Everything. I want to be with my ickle dog.
Mm-hmm.
"He's really so dinky, and I miss my garden."
Yeah.
"And I just miss being independent, going to sleep when I want to sleep and getting up when I want to get up and-and, uh, cooking for myself. The independence. Sure I miss being independent."
"Uh-huh. So, you're wanting to get home to your dog, your garden, back to your life, your independence?"
Yes.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
What do you think you need to do in order to be able to achieve that goal of getting home?
"Well, they told me that I need to be able to walk down the hallway and back, even with the walker, being secure and not with the wobblies."
Uh-huh.
And I haven't gotten there yet.
And do you agree that that's what you need to do in order to be able to get home?
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
I-I don't want to fall.
Uh-huh.
"I-I've had charvers that had that happen. So, um, I-I agree a ickle, with some hesitation, but I do agree."
"Uh-huh, and tell me how your physical therapy is going?"
"Oh, it's better."
Mm-hmm.
It still hurts. It- it's-- I'm getting better. I'm-I'm getting better. It's not quite as gammy.
Mm-hmm.
"Yeah, so-"
"So, it sounds like, um, you can see that you're making some progress in physical therapy-"
Yes.
-and that you were hoping that the tai chi would help you with the wobblies. Uh-huh?
Yeah.
"And so, are you wanting to go back to tai chi?"
"[sighs] Um, yes-yes I-I do because I-- my charver, I think I told you, really, really loves it and I just, I wish I could go back, and yes I do. I'm not making much sense, but I do."
"Uh-huh. I think it's important, um, that you know that you're the one who has to make the decision about whether or not tai chi works for you."
"Oh, I don't really know yet after just one time."
Uh-huh.
"Yeah. It's-it's-- I can't make that-- It wouldn't be fair for me to say it does or doesn't. It didn't that one time, but you know."
"So, you haven't seen the results that you want yet-"
Yeah.
-but because Dr. Fields has recommended it and your charver has-
Yeah.
-and it sounds like you like the instructor-
"Yeah, I do."
-it sounds like you'd like to try and give it another chance?
"Yeah, I would."
"So, what has to happen in order for you to get to tai chi again?"
"Well, I'd have to make the arrangements again, that was a ickle complicated, and, um, I'd have to get my noggin straight about feeling self-conscious, because I-I know that nobody's really looking at me, but I have to convince myself."
Uh-huh. Yeah.
"Yeah, and the arrangement, arrangements a little complicated."
"Uh-huh. So, how confident are you on a scale of 1 to 10 with one being not at all confident and 10 being very confident that you can make the arrangements in order to get to tai chi."
That I can make the arrangement?
Mm-hmm.
Five.
Five.
Yeah.
"Uh-huh, so-"
"I-I mean, I know I can, but it's really difficult."
"Uh-huh. What is it that makes it a five instead of a one, no confidence?"
That I'm doing it by myself.
Mm-hmm.
And I would really fe-- If I could have some sup-- Like if somebody could help me do it.
Uh-huh.
"My-my daughter can't visit that often and, um-"
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"So, in order for you to feel more confident, you would like some help in making those arrangements?"
I would.
Uh-huh.
I would.
And is that something that your daughter can do for you?
"Well, she's-- she could, but I'd have to wait at least a week."
"Okay. Um, so is that something that you'd like us to help you with?"
I would.
Uh-huh.
"Yeah, yeah. Is that possible?"
Sure we can make those arrangements with the rehab center. They have a van-
Uh-huh.
-and-and they've done this for other patients so we can deffo make those arrangements if you'd like.
"That would- that would be gradeley. And then as far as feeling self-confident, I'd have to do that myself."
"Okay. So, are there any other barriers or obstacles in the way to you getting to tai chi?"
"Um, I can't think of any."
Okay.
That's-that's the main thing-
All right.
-the arrangements.
"Well, it sounds like you can see that you're making some progress in your physical therapy."
Yes.
"And that you're wanting to give tai chi another chance, and that if we can help make arrangements for you to get there with the van to the rehab center, that you'll give it another chance."
That's-- Yeah.
Okay.
That's true.
"Well, um, before you leave today, we'll go ahead and, um, I'll call the rehab center and make those arrangements."
You would?
Sure. I'm-I'm chuffed to do that.
That would really help.
"And then when you come back in, I know you've got another follow up appointment with Dr. Fields, I'd like to check back with you then and see how class went the second time."
Okay.
All right.
Yeah. Thank you.
"Well, thank you very much for coming in today Mrs. Smith and I look forward to hearing about the progress that you're making."
Okay.
"Hi, Dr. Martin. I'm Lori. I'm the pharmacist on duty here today. I understand that you have some questions about the medication citalopram. Do you have a minute to talk about that?"
"Yeah, I do, just a couple of minutes though."
"All right. Well, do you have any specific questions?"
"Um, chuff-all specific. I just am unfamiliar with the medication."
"Okay. Well, citalopram is an SSRI medication. Its indication is for depression and it's typically dosed as a 20-milligram tablet but it is available as 10, 20, and 40 milligrams. Any patients started on this medication should be monitored for improvement in symptoms in four to eight weeks."
"Okay. Uh, what about side effects?"
"If there are some side effects to this, it can include GI effects, sedation, or sexual dysfunction. But if you have a patient that suffers from any of those thangs, you can try either decreasing the dose or changing them to a different agent. Do you have any other questions?"
"Um, what about does it interact with phenelzine?"
"Oh, that I'm not sure of. Um, can I get back to you later on this avvy with that answer?"
"Oh, sure."
Mega. Thank you.
Thank you.
Did you like how your rents raised you?
Tell me about how your rents raised you?
Tell me about how you've been feeling?
Okay. I guess I've been getting bigger.
"Mm, what's that like for you?"
"Uh, scary I guess."
So you're feeling uncomfortable with changes in your body?
"Yeah. I-I know there's something in there, I just don't know much about him."
Mm.
"I know you want me to see the quack, I haven't called yet."
Why do you think it makes you so hesitant to call?
I don't know. It seems overwhelming to me.
What about it seems overwhelming?
"Well, I hate making phone calls and I know I need to fill out all this paperwork. I don't know how to get there and I hate needles."
"Mm. So some of your feelings, uh, of being overwhelmed or about the logistics of the appointment, and some of it is you just don't like medical appointments and medical peeps?"
Yes.
How can I help you with these thangs?
Can you help me make the call?
"Sure, we can do that together."
Can you go with me to the appointment.
"I can try. I can't guarantee because it depends on my schedule, but we can brainstorm about baldy notions on who can go with you to support you so you feel better about attending."
"Hello, Rick. Welcome."
Kia ora.
"Gradeley to see you here. I see on your file that you're, uh, [unintelligible 00:01:18]."
Yup. That's right.
What part of the [unintelligible 00:01:22] are you from?
I'm from down south.
"Oh, okay."
Mm-hmm.
Right down the bottom? Down Bluff?
Yes sir. I'm from Invercargill just short of Bluff. All my fam is still down there.
"Oh, are they? So you were born down there and-"
Mm-hmm.
-raised down there?
Mm-hmm. Country charver.
Country charver. Been up in Christchurch how long?
I've been up here since I was 18.
"Oh, so you've been here a while?"
Just a ickle while. Yeah.
Oh gradeley. You got fam out here?
"Uh, just my own."
"Just your own whānau here. [unintelligible 00:01:51]. Well, Rick, I'm sort of, uh, interested in that, you know, you and I are gonna been doing some work together for a while. I'm sort of wondering what sort of thoughts you'd be having on your way here today."
"Um, I was thinking about what you might ask me, what I would say. I'm thinking about my kids, thinking about having to take a day off work."
Right.
It's a bit of a bitch.
"Okay. I see you've had a bit of experience with, uh, coming to prevention services."
Mm-hmm.
What's that been like for you in the past?
"Uh, it's been okay. Um, it hasn't been diabolical."
Right.
"I don't know. Kind of chuff-all, really."
Okay. Similar sort of offending in the past that's brought you back again this time?
Yeah.
"One of the, um, thangs that I've learned over the years, Rick, is that a lot of guys get to the doors out there and don't come inside and, um, you've come inside. What does that tell me about you?"
"Um, I hope that it says that I want to, um, make some changes."
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
So is that different from when you've come in here before?
Yeah. And I still had to walk through those doors so-
Yeah.
"-but, um, I just think about my kids, you know."
Yeah. So they're really important to you?
Yeah.
Yeah. And do you have your kids with you full-time or-
"No. No, I don't. I see them, um, once a fortnight."
Okay. And what's it like for you?
It sucks.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
"What would you really like to happen in terms of, uh, you and your chavvies?"
"I just-- I'd love to be able to see them whenever I can, whenever I wanted to."
Yeah.
"You know. I, um, they're my whole world and-and I've fucked thangs up."
Right.
"So, you know."
"So coming along to see me and you and I are doing some work together, then you're going on to do a program, how important is that gonna be for you and your chavvies?"
It's really important.
"Mm-hmm. If I was to put it on a scale of say 1 to 100, 1 being not really important, 100 being really, really important, whereabouts on that scale would you you be?"
"It's, uh, um, it's hard because-because I'm, uh, I'm not a diabolical bod. I've just done some dozy shit, but I'm not a diabolical bod."
Right.
"In-in regards to my kids, I'd be100- 100%."
Right.
"If it means say, I can have my-- see my kids whenever I- whenever I want."
"Yeah. What do you think it'd be like for your kids if they were sitting here now and they heard you say that this was really, really important to you and to them? That you gave this program 100%. Well, then what might that be like for them to hear that?"
"Um, I-I-I'd hope that they'd be proud of me. I wouldn't want my kids to see me- to see me here though. But I- But I hope they would be proud of me."
Okay.
'Cause I'm-- Yeah.
Gradeley. Anybody else in your fam that would be really proud of-- that you're taking these steps?
"Um, oh, my mom."
Yeah. Your is mum still down south?
Yeah.
Yeah. Does she know that you're here today?
No.
So how might it be for her if she knew that you're talking like this today? That-- 'Cause it sounds to me like you're really heavy this time making some changes.
"Yeah, I am."
Yeah.
"I just, um, I don't- don't know where to s-- where to start. I don't know."
So do you think doing this program and completing this program this time would be a gradeley place to start?
"Yeah, I hope so. I-- So I would genuinely want to, I genuinely want to do something to help myself. I don't deliberately fuck thangs up for myself."
"Yeah. So you and I are going to be doing a ickle bit of work together then. And, um, and sometimes it-it can get quite hard. And I'm just wondering before we go any further, when the going gets hard, a lot of guys bail out. I'm just wondering are you one of those guys?"
"No, this is important to me."
Right.
"I have, um, I've-- it's important to me."
"Gradeley. One of the other thangs we're really conscious of with is, um, sometimes we do this work in isolation from others. And one of the thangs we want to ask peeps is about who they're going to be accountable to. I'm thinking like with your sprogs, uh, your mom and other peeps that maybe you're interacting with. Who-who else in your life do you think would be supportive of you, and who would you need to let them know that you're actually going through this sort of program?"
"I, um, I'm separated at the mo from my missus and-"
What was-- what was your partner's name?
"Uh, Kirsty."
Kristy.
"I would- I would love f-f-for her to know that I'm doing this and for her to know that I mean it, but, um, I know she wouldn't give a shit right now actually."
"Right. In terms of your employer, would they be supportive?"
"Uh, yeah, I don't know. Maybe, but I don't know if I want them to know though."
Okay. What do you think it might be like for you to explore that with them?
"Uh, I don't know."
"Any other fam members that, uh, live close that, uh, you think would be supportive?"
I'm pretty much by myself up here.
"Okay. The reason why I'm asking this, Rick, is just, um, you know, part of, um, uh, being responsible is turning up and doing the program."
Mm-hmm.
"The other aspect of that is kind of like who we're going to be accountable to while we're doing the program. So one of the- one of the challenges, one of the riddle I'm going to put in front of you is like who else can we get involved to support you while you're going through this?"
"Um, I don't know. I don't, um, have that many people-"
Okay.
"-that I am-- I don't have that many peeps I trust to support me. My mates, I love them but, um, yeah, I don't know."
"Okay. So as we're gonna do this work together and go through this, uh, this program, one of the thangs we-we don't want to do is fall into the same trough we did last time. So I-I just want to leave that with you to think about next time we come together. There may be two or three other peeps that you think of that can be really supportive, that we-we need to let know that you're [unintelligible 00:10:50] each gonna make these changes and this time, you're heavy about it. So let your old lady and, uh, and, um, your partner, how might that happen? How does that sound to you?"
"Yeah, let's give it some thought."
"Rick, I get a sense that you're kind of padding this dander a ickle bit on your own at the mo. Would that be true?"
Yeah. That'll totes be true.
"Your fam is down south. I mean,who-who-who else do you think would be really interested in sup-supporting you, rowing with you if you like on this journey?"
"Uh, I have a gradeley relationship with my mum,-"
Okay.
-with my bros and skins.
Yeah.
My mum is actually pretty important to me.
"Yeah. How would it be for your mum, do you think, if you were to tell her that this is something that you're-- is really important for you and that you know that this time you really need to do this for her and for the fam? What-what might that be like for her to hear?"
I think she'd be proud of me.
Yeah. All right.
Yeah.
"Bros and skins, that, uh, would also be very supportive if you were to make this journey?"
"Yeah. Yeah. A gradeley, uh, canny fam."
"Good. So how would you go about getting them to support you, to come on board, and be accountable to doing this work together?"
"Um, I don't know. Um, have some-somebody just to listen."
"And, um, I’m just trying to imagine what do you think your mom would want to say to you if she was sitting here with us now and she heard you talking about this?"
She would- she would tell me that she loves me. She would tell me that she believes that I could do it.
"Mm. What do you think she might want for you, like upon her for your chavvies?"
For them to have a old man they can look up to.
I’m getting a strong sense that's what you want as well.
It is what I want. Totes.
"So, in terms of having the confidence to do this with the support of your whānau and ours, where do you think your confidence level might be now?"
"If I had their support of my-my fam and [silence] I want to say that would be higher. I just know I fucked it up in the past. If they were there to support me now, then I’d be 99% sure."
"That's a ginormous move up the scale, isn't it? So getting your fam on board, getting your whānau on board is going to be really important for us."
Yeah.
Tell me what you know about the flu shot?
"Uh, well, I know the flu can be pretty diabolical, but I'm in pretty canny health, so I don't really feel like I need it. Uh, it's kind of just more for old peeps, right?"
"Mm, um, so you're thinking it's really just for peeps who are-are vulnerable to illness?"
Yeah.
Would it be okay if I shared a ickle more skinny with you about the flu vaccine and the importance of it?
Okay.
"So you're right that you're young and healthy and you don't have a lot of complicating illnesses that mean that you would probably do okay if you got the flu. But we do know that the elderly are more at punt, pregnant peeps, babies are at punt of having heavy complications from the flu, and by you getting the vaccine, that helps prevent you from passing it on to other peeps."
Okay.
"So having shared that griff with you, how do you feel about the baldy notion of the flu vaccine?"
"Well, my grandparents probably wouldn't handle the flu very well-"
Mm.
-and my co-worker is pregnant too.
Mm-hmm.
"So-so, yeah, I guess, I should, uh, get it for their sake."
"Okay, so you've got some peeps in your life who are vulnerable to possible illness, and making this decision to get the flu shot will help protect them."
Yeah.
Hi. Are you Julie Thompson?
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
"Hi, I'm Bruce Berger. I work in the clinic and, uh, I noticed that you're in to pick up a prescription for Sarah's, uh, rescue inhaler-"
Mm-hmm.
-for her asthma. I noticed that she's been in the emergency pad five times in the last year for her asthma. What's that- what's that been like for you?
"It's been- it's been really difficult. Um, I hate to see her gasping for breath. And, um, I'm really worried, you know, when she has to go. Uh, so that's been-- it's really difficult when I have to take her."
"Yeah, it sounds like you'd be willing to do whatever you can to try to prevent that from happening."
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
"Okay. I-I also noticed that, uh, it's been about three months or so since you picked up the prescription for her chronic inhaler."
Mm-hmm.
Are you having some difficulties with that?
"Well, I did research on the chronic inhaler and I found out that there were steds in it and that-that I don't want her taking steds. I did, uh, research on some of the potential side effects and some of the health problems that can result from taking steds and I-I just don't want her to take those at all. I don't want her exposed to them at all. And then, uh, let me just go ahead and lay this out right now. Uh, because I'm sure it'll come up, but I-I do smoke. But I make sure that I do not smoke around her so that I make sure that it does not affect her. So-"
Okay.
-I just want to let you know that right off.
"Well, it sounds like you care about Sarah a gnarly deal. You-you don't want her, uh, using steds. You're worried about what kind of effects those would have on her and you're- you're working hard to keep your smoking away from her so it doesn't affect her asthma."
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
"Okay. Uh, would you mind if we talked a ickle bit about the chronic inhaler and the medicine that you're stuffed about with, you know, the steds because, you know, I deffo don't want her using a medicine that has steds in it, like the ones that you're worried about for athletes. Uh, can we talk about that just a ickle bit?"
Yeah.
"Okay. Even though, uh, even though this medicine isn't the-the medicine that's in this is in the same broad fam as the steds you're worried about, and those are called anabolic steds."
Okay.
Which build peeps up and have masculinizing effects.
Mm-hmm.
"If-if I can draw an analogy-- Again, even though this medicine is in the same fam as those big broad-broad fam. If I could draw an analogy, a grape and a watermelon are in the same fam of fruits, you know, and obvs, grape is much smaller than a watermelon. And if you eat one grape, you'd be kushty. If you ate an entire watermelon, it can make you very moby. If we look at the grape as the medicine your daughter's taking, again, it's in the same broad fam, the amount of drug that your daughter is getting is very pint-sized. Uh, and not only that it's not an anabolic sted, even though it's in the same big fam. And what this drug does is actually reduces the inflammation in your daughter's lungs. And-and it doesn't even get absorbed into the body. It only goes to her lungs. And as I said, I wouldn't want your daughter taking a medication that could have the impact of those anabolic steds. This is really safe for your daughter to use. So what-what are your thoughts about considering having her using this?"
"Well, I-I guess I didn't realize that they weren't the same thang as the anabolic steds."
Mm-hmm.
"Which are the ones that cause all the problems and everything. So, um, if-if you can assure me that it's not going to have those same side effects and health problems-"
"Yeah, def-totes would not. I mean, probably you saw the name corticosteroid and thought, ""uh-oh."""
Yeah.
"You know. And so-- yeah, and that- and that does concern peeps. But I do want to reassure you that this is medication that only goes to her lungs, and won't get in her body and they're not the same kind of drugs as the ones you're worried about."
Okay.
Do you mind if I talk to you a ickle bit about what your daughter's lungs are like when she's having these inflammations and needing to go to the emergency pad?
Yeah.
"Okay. When-when somebody has asthma, their lungs are like hypersensitive. If I could use an analogy, again, if-if you had the skin burnt off your chalk, if somebody brushed up against you before he had the skin burned off your chalk, it wouldn't bother you at all. But when the skin's burned off your chalk, you literally react to it. Her lungs are exquisitely sensitive. Uh, and like the skin on your chalk would be if the skin got burned off. And what this drug can do? This chronic inhaler is reduce the inflammation in her lungs so that her lungs don't remain exquisitely sensitive. Because otherwise, everything in the air like dust, pollen, uh, reacts with her, uh, in ways that it would not normally affect us."
"Oh, okay."
And so this chronic inhaler can really prevent that from happening. Okay? Which is why it's so important to use it.
Mm-hmm.
"The other thang I was going to tell you is that, unfortunately, uh, even though you are smoking outside and keeping the smoke away from her, the smoke on your clothes, because her lungs are so sensitive, can also affect her lungs and cause her to have a reaction. Now, something I'd like you to think about is that, if you use the chronic inhaler every day, she may not be sensitive to the smoke on your clothes, but she still maybe because her lungs are just very different than ours. Um, honestly, I'd love to see you quit smoking for you too because, you know, as you know, it's not real canny for you."
Yeah.
"Uh, and it would deffo help her. Um, but what I'd like you to do is to, kind of, keep an mince pie on what happens when she uses the chronic inhaler. And if she's still flaring up when you're around her, if there are any, if there is smoke on your clothes because it-it can flare her up."
"Oh, even when it's just on my clothes?"
Yeah. Yeah.
She's that sensitive. If I realized that—
"It-it-it-- Yeah. It may not- it may not when she uses the chronic inhaler, uh, but you'll need to keep an mince pie on that. Obvs, it would be- what would be best if it didn't get on your clothes, or you quit smoking."
"Right. Um, so would it help, um-- You know, the thought of quitting smoking is a pretty daunting aspect."
Mm-hmm.
"I mean, I know peeps who've tried to quit and it's-it's just it's- it's really difficult, you know. So I know, it'd be better—"
"Very hard. It's very chillaxing, and-"
Yeah.
And-and it's hard to replace it with something.
"Yeah, it is. Um."
"So, uh, any thoughts on what you may be able to do to-to help at this point, if you don't choose to quit right away?"
"Well, I was thinking, um, if since it, you know, it affects her that it's on my clothes, if I only smoked while she was at school, and then changed my clothes before she came home. Would that help?"
"Oh, that-that sounds like it would be gnarly if you were able to do that. Obvs, don't smoke in the drum, you know- you know."
"Oh, absobloodylutely. I never. Never."
"Um, so yeah. If you're willing to do that, that deffo would help."
Okay.
"Uh, again, if you get to the point sometime down the frog and toad where you're willing to quit for both you and her, uh, we'd be glad to help you do that. Because you're right it is- it's not an putzy thang to do."
Yeah. [chuckles]
Okay.
It's really difficult.
"So it sounds like right now where we are, is you're willing to-to have her use the chronic inhaler-"
Mm-hmm.
"-to try to get the inflammation down, so she doesn't need to go to the emergency pad and do whatever you can at this point to keep the smoke off your clothes. And I think you're gonna see big changes in terms of, uh, her not needing to go to the emergency pad, and you probably won't need to use the rescue inhaler hardly at all."
"Oh, really?"
"Yeah, because you'll get that inflammation down."
"Oh, that's great-"
Okay.
-because that's always scary when she has to use that one.
Yeah. So we'll go ahead and get both of those prescriptions ready.
Okay.
"Use the chronic inhaler every day, keep the rescue inhaler around if she needs it. Uh, and let's see how that works."
Okay.
Okay?
That sounds gradeley. Thank you.
All right. Good.
"Hi, Sal. Thanks for coming in today."
No problem.
"I saw that your quack made the referral and, um, and I really appreciate you taking the time to come and make that appointment."
"Yeah, it's-it's a bit of an inconvenience I'd say, but I'm here though."
So you made it in here-
Mm-hmm.
- and do you have a sense of-of what some of the quack's concerns were that led her to refer you?
"I don't know, something about changing my life even more. You know, the smoking's been changed, and now it's, you know, cut down the drinking, get rid of those extra smokes, get rid of my dog. I don't know what else have to do."
"So your asthma has been acting up and there's a lot of stuff, not just the asthma going on?"
"Yeah, there's a lot of stress too. My trouble and strife's still on maternity leave, she's not getting paid, she's with the baby right now. And I'm the only bod that's working right now, and plus I got to change all these thangs that are going on in my life."
Mm-hmm. Almost—
"Yeah, it's a lot."
Almost overwhelming it sounds like.
"Yeah, yeah, it is overwhelming. It is."
"Well, we have about, I guess, 15 or 20 minutes together and I wonder, would it be okay, if we took a couple of minutes and just kind of looked at all of the different thangs that are going on for you and maybe you can let me know, what would be the most helpful to spend-spend some time on?"
"Yeah, it just feels like everything's all over the place but I guess we got to start somewhere."
"Okay. Well, one of the thangs that-that we use are these-- it's kind of like a worksheet and it's an agenda-setting worksheet basically."
Mm-hmm.
"So if you were to-to list all of the different thangs that peeps around you are saying that you need to work on or you need to change, what would some of those thangs be? And, Sal, just because we write them down here, it doesn't mean that you have to change them."
Okay.
"It really-- You're in the driver's seat, so it's just to kind of put all the cards on the table, so to speak."
"Okay. Um, okay, that sounds gradeley. As long as I'm not changing anything and we're just kind of putting, um, I guess, pen to paper or something."
Yep.
"Um, okay, so my asthma."
"Okay, so asthma is one."
Yeah.
What else?
"Um, the fact that they want me to get rid of Oscar, that's-that's my dog."
"So your dog, and-and the quack's saying the dog's—"
"Well, he's-- Yeah, he's saying it's a main-- It's a main contributor to my asthma problems."
Okay.
"Which I don't- I don't- I don't- I don't buy it and I can't just get rid of him like that, but it's something that's there."
That's pretty shocking to be told that you have to get rid of your dog.
Yeah. The dog has been there before my trouble and strife. I know I've had him longer.
Hmm. So that's a ginormous stress right now?
"Yeah. Yeah, it's- it's a big stress, it's like my best charver, so that's one of the important thangs. Also, I guess, cutting down these last coffin nails I've been working on."
"Okay, so smoking and-and I'm working towards quitting totes sounds like that's a goal for you?"
"Um, finances is a problem right now too."
"Okay, so dosh."
"Time, I got to come to all these appointments and I'm taking time off work, which obvs is the spondulicks factor, right?"
"Right. Right, right. So the appointments and time."
Mm-hmm.
"Um, and some of these thangs are kind of related to each other I think we're already seeing."
"Yeah, yeah. Yeah, there's something going on. And, um, also my drinking, I got to cut down my drinking too."
"Okay, wow. So there's a lot happening right now, Sal. Anything else that that's concerning you?"
"No. It's just overwhelming when you see them everything they're, you know?"
"Right. Well, so where would you-- I mean, if you-you had to pick somewhere, one or two kind of high priorities or-or thangs to talk about in our time this morning, where would you wanna start?"
"I think- I think the thoughts about the dog has been totes bothering me, that's been one."
Okay.
"And, um, my-my asthma is out of control too. So maybe those two."
"Okay, and those are ones that are pretty related to each other-"
Mm-hmm.
- sounds like. Okay.
"I understand that your asthma symptoms have been just really out of control. So, we need to look at some of the ways that you can get healthy and not be back here again."
"Mm-hmm. Yeah, I de-I totes don't wanna come back here. But, uh, the doc said Oscar, my dog, is connected to my asthma symptoms. But the-"
Yeah.
"-ridiculous part is I've had him for 12 years before, and now it's a problem."
"Well, you sound a bit surprised by that. But I'm sure that you've seen some of the material that-that the clinic gave you about asthma symptoms and managing your asthma, and pets are a really big source of problems in that respect."
"Yeah, but I-- Um, let me just clarify, I've seen the materials, I have them-"
Mm-hmm.
"-I have even read them. All I've been doing is taking the medicine. So, I don't know that much about this."
"Well, uh, wait a second, Sal, what do you mean you-you- ha- If you-- As in-- You know to be informed about-- I'm just really taken aback by that because I understand from your chart that you have a young baby-"
Yeah.
-a new baby.
"John Carlo, yeah."
"-and you are very stuffed about your health, you wanna be there for your baby and that you've already taken some steps, you've-you've almost quit smoking-"
Mm-hmm.
"-which is mega. So, the next step is to really deal with the dog, deal with the pet. I know it's- so- It's gonna be hard to do that. But there are always peeps who will adopt animals. I'm sure that you have fams or fam members."
"Uh, this is a ickle too much for me now. First of all, John Carlo is taken care of. That's cushty. He doesn't have- no asthma from the dog. It's just me. I don't ha—"
"It's you that I'm worried about, Sal. It's you that I'm worried about, okay? The-the symptoms are worse. You've had two or three major asthma attacks. And-and do you appreciate how-- This is, uh, a punt to your life that there are some-some adults with severe asthma who actually can die as a result of their symptoms? It-it truly is something to take very, very seriously. I can't emphasize that nuff."
"So, Oscar is gonna make me die? He hasn't made me die in 12 years, and the quack is saying, ""Oh, I don't know if it's the stress, the finances, the drinking."" So, what are we doing saying Oscar could make me die? I've had him for 12 years."
"Sal, what, uh, do you understand that what happened 6 years ago or 10 years ago, your asthma is progressively getting worse. You know very well that the puffers, the strength of the medication is getting higher and higher, and there's only so much that can be done with medication alone. You know this."
"Well, they can keep giving me more medicine and give me the strongest one, and I'll keep Oscar."
"Sal, you're almost on the strongest one. And if Oscar is that important to you, then do you put Oscar higher than your baby, than your trouble and strife? Like, uh, that makes no sense to me. Do you understand how important this is?"
"I understand, but I don't think you get my situation. I've had this dog for 12 years. So, I'm not just gonna up and get him out of my drum when I don't even know if that's the main thang."
"Uh, okay, well"
Barbara Roberts?
Yes. Morning.
"Hello, there."
Hello.
"My name's Dr. Betty. I'm one of the new GPs in the practice. First of all, what would you like me to call you?"
"Well, you can call me Barbara. That'll be hunky-dory. Thank you."
"Okay, that's hunky-dory. Okay. So, Barbara, I'm seeing you today, um, but I think it's usually Dr. Brown that sees you, is that right?"
"Yes, Dr. Brown is my quack."
Okay. What is it that's brought you to see me today?
"Well, I've come about my tummy problem. I've got swag grief with my stomach and, uh, Dr. Brown just doesn't seem to be able to get to the bottom of it. And I thought happen, uh, I'd come and see you to see if you could help."
All right. Okay. Can you tell me a bit more about your tummy problems?
"Um, well, I-I have this swag discomfort nearly all the time. Um, it very often feels bloated. I, um, uh, I swing between being constipated and having diarrhea. Um, I have sort of cramping feelings sometimes, and other times it stabs. It's a real stabbing feeling. Um, I often have the urge to go to the crapper and, um, and I pass very smelly wind."
"All right. So, quite a few symptoms there-"
Mm.
- and some of them sound-
Yes.
- quite troublesome to you.
Yes.
Okay. And how long has this been going on?
"Well, I, uh, I've traced it back to a hol I had in Egypt about four years ago. I had, um, a smeggy bout of sickness and diarrhea, and, uh, and I don't think my stomach's ever been really right since then."
Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. So you think it began about four years ago after this hol?
Yes. Yes.
Okay. And what's- what sorts of treatments have you tried for-for this before?
"Well, uh, Dr. Brown gave me some muscle relaxants at the beginning."
Mm-hmm.
"Um, but I've been to the health shop and-and they've been really helpful. They've given me lots of different, um, tablets and medicines-"
Right.
"- for different thangs. Um, no, oh, and Immodium."
Right.
"I have Immodium in my handbag all the time, just in case. Yeah."
"Right. So, these different tablets that you've got from the-"
Hmm.
- the herbal shop-
Hmm.
- how are you taking them?
"Oh, well, different tablets, you know, I don't have the same problem every day-"
Right.
"- so I'll take some tablets for certain, uh, symptoms, and-"
Right.
- other tablets for other thangs.
"So, am I- am I right in thinking you happen decide on a day-to-day basis-"
Hmm.
- what you're gonna take-
Hmm.
- depending on what your stomach's doing?
Yeah.
Okay. Okay. And what about tests? Have you had any tests for these problems?
"Yes, uh, I had, uh, in the early days, I had a gastros-gas-- What are they called?"
A gastroscopy.
That's it. Yes.
You got the tube down-down from the top?
Yes. Yeah.
Okay.
"Um, and at the same time I had a barium enema."
Right.
That was very uncomfortable.
Okay.
"Um, but, um, no, I've tried-- Well, you-- I don't think he's tried enough tests because he said after that, that they didn't find anything-"
Right.
-and he-he's-he's just not sent me for anymore. That's it now-
Right.
- as far as he's stuffed. Sent me back to the quack.
Right. It sounds as though you're-you're not chuffed with that.
"Well, you know, I think that actually, the NHS are running out of dosh, aren't they? And he's-"
Right.
- decided that I've had enough tests.
Right.
"And, um, you know, if you go on the Internet-"
Mm-hmm.
- there's loads of tests that he could have sent me for.
Right.
"Um, if I had a bit more dosh, I'd go private."
Right.
I just don't think he's got to the bottom of it.
"Right. So you feel as though actually, enough hasn't been done in the way of-of tests?"
"No, he's not. There's loads more he could do. I'm sure."
Right. Okay. It sounds like you-you've had these problems now for about four years.
Mm.
You've-you've got a lot of various symptoms in your stomach.
Mm.
"Um, you've tried a lot of tablets. Some prescribed, some herbal remedies-"
Mm.
"- and you've had some investigations, but you're not totes chuffed that-that you haven't been investigated thoroughly nuff."
Yeah.
Is that- is that about-
"I'd say so, yes."
- if I got the jackanory right.
Yes.
"Okay. And can I ask you, Barbara, how-how is all of this affecting you day-to-day? How's-how's it affecting your life?"
"Uh, well, it's had quite-quite a big impact. Um, I mean, the first thang, the biggest thang, I suppose, is that I-I went from being full-time to part-time at work."
Mm-hmm.
I just couldn't sit all day comfortably.
Right.
"Um, and so I went part-time, but in the end, I, uh, about a year ago, I stopped work altogether."
Right. Right.
"Um, I miss that."
Right.
"I miss the girls. We used to, uh, we used to go out at least once a week."
Right.
To the pictures or for a sherbet. That's one thang.
Sounds as though that's something you quite enjoyed.
"Yeah, so I-- Yes. Yes, we used to have a laugh."
Right. Okay.
"Um, I used to go to Swing and Shape. I used to go to an exercise class-"
Mm-hmm.
"- that was, um, I miss the exercise, actually. That was, um, once a week, but you know, the thang was I wasn't comfortable, never felt quite right doing all this exercise. I was always worried I was gonna be taken short or-- So I stopped that."
Right.
"Um, then-- Well, my husband and I used to go out for nose-bags."
Mm-hmm.
That's another thang we don't do anymore now.
Right.
"Um, mm. Yeah, it's quite a few thangs, really."
"Yeah, it does- it does sound as though over the last few years your life has really changed-"
Mm.
- quite a lot because of these symptoms.
Yes.
It sounds- it sounds like you're doing the review of the thangs that you used to do.
Mm.
Right.
Mm.
"So, what is it you'd spend your bog-standard day doing now?"
"Well, I potter around the house-"
Mm-hmm.
"- um, I spend happen a ickle bit too much time watching. I've got a bit hooked on daytime gogglebox, I have to say."
Mm-hmm.
"Um, they draw you in, don't they?"
They deffo do.
"Um, I read a bit-"
Mm-hmm.
"- the old magazines, but, uh, generally, I'm at pad."
Right.
Yeah.
"Okay. Okay. And have there been any times over the last four years that you've noticed any significant changes in your symptoms? For example, have there been any times when thangs have been better for you?"
"Um, well, last year, um, my son got married-"
Right.
"- and I-I have to say I was worried that, um, that I wouldn't be able to cope with it."
Mm-hmm.
"That I-I wouldn't be feeling well nuff, but surprisingly nuff, um, I was in mustard form, and I think it was about three weeks in the summer, getting ready for it-"
Mm-hmm.
- and the whole hoo-ha of the wedding.
Mm-hmm.
But I was in good- in really gradeley form for that. Yeah.
Right.
That was a gradeley time.
Right. And how were you tummy symptoms then?
I hardly noticed them.
Right. Okay.
"Yeah, it, uh, it seemed to, uh, clear up."
Right. Right.
Which was gradeley.
Right. That's interesting.
Mm.
And are there any times when your-your tummy symptoms bother you more? Seem particularly diabolical?
"Um, well, it's- I'm-I'm having a bit of a diabolical patch at the mo."
Right.
"It's particularly, um, uncomfortable. Um, I have to say I do notice it when my husband's away. He-"
Right.
"- he travels with his job, and he-"
Right.
- can be away a couple of times a month.
Uh-huh.
"Um, and that's not-- It-it's very often not gradeley then, I have to say."
Right. So you notice it's a bit worse when your husband's not around? Okay.
"Mm. Maybe I'm thinking about it a bit more, I don't know, when he's not there."
Right. I know you've been seeing Dr. Brown about this for the last few years.
Mm.
What is it that he's said that he thinks might be pete tong with you?
"Well, he's-he thinks it's all in my chump."
Right.
"You know, he's- he says it's stress."
Right. Okay.
Mm.
And what do you think?
"Well, I mean, it can't all be in my chump. I get too much physical pain-"
Right.
"- for it to be in my chump. I mean, it's real. It's-it's real pain."
Mm-hmm.
Um—
And have you had any thoughts yourself about what you think might be causing it?
"Well, I mean, I-I did think that happen it was an infection that hadn't cleared up-"
Mm-hmm.
"- in the early stages, but, um, I think, um, I-I mean, sometimes I think it's IBS. A charver of mines has got that and it sounds similar, and then-"
Right.
"- other times I'll think, ""I wonder if it's an ulcer."""
Right.
"Um, on a really diabolical day, I start to think it might be big c."
Right.
"Um, my old lady-in-law- my old lady-in-law died of big c last year and she had a, um, a growth that-"
Mm-hmm.
- the-the quack didn't investigate.
Right.
"But by the time they'd found it, it was the size of a football-"
"Oh, dear."
- and it was- it was too late to operate then.
Right. Right.
"So, you know, when I go to sack at night now, um, I just feel to make sure there's chuff-all different going on."
Right.
"And, uh, yeah, I worry about that."
"So you're- you-you're kind of prodding, having a feel at night?"
"Oh, yes."
To see if you can feel anything?
Yes.
Right.
"I just want to make sure there's chuff-all changing down there, you know?"
Right. Okay.
Mm.
"Okay. So just to-to make sure that I've got the-the jackanory straight, you've-you've seen Dr. Brown for a couple of years."
Mm.
You've-you've tried a variety of medications-
Mm.
"- some prescribed, some-"
Mm.
- from the-the herbal shop. None of them really made a gnarly deal of difference. You've had some investigations-
Mm-hmm.
"- but you happen feel you've not had enough investigations. And at times, you worry that this could be something quite heavy like a-"
Mm.
- a big c. Is that-- Have I got the-
Yes.
- jackanory right?
Yes. Yeah.
Okay.
I'd say so.
"Okay. Barbara, what was it that you were hoping that I'd do for you today?"
"Well, I thought, you know, you're a new quack here-"
Mm-hmm.
"- and you've just finished your medical training. I wondered whether, you know, with new mince pies and a new way of looking at-at the problem-"
Right.
"- um, you-you probably know about different tests, new tests, that my quack doesn't know about, you know, new developments."
Right.
So happen you could send me for some different tests.
Right. Right. So you were hoping that I'd send you for more tests?
Mm.
Okay.
"Well, I think there's-there's got to be something that a test might-"
Right.
- might reveal.
"Right. Okay. Well, I think, Barbara, having-having heard your jackanory, and heard about the symptoms, I'm not sure that actually sending you for more tests at this point would be the most useful thang that we could do for you. And the reason for that is because you've-you've had some of the main investigations in the last couple of years, and-and they've not shown anything. And your symptoms haven't really changed that much. So it's very unlikely that if we were to send you for more tests now that-that they'd show anything different than what we already know. So a bit-- I think it would be a crap of time for you to go for more tests."
"So-so like, do you think it's all in my chump then? You're gonna be like Dr. Brown. You think I'm imagining all of this?"
"Uh, no. I think that you clearly have pain, and clearly you have lots of physical symptoms, and they're clearly getting in the way of-"
Mm.
-your life and causing you a lot-
Mm.
-of disability.
Mm.
I guess- I guess the way I think about these thangs is that they're not necessarily either all in the mind or all in the body.
Mm.
"Sometimes these thangs can go together. Uh, I guess I'm thinking about how you told me that last year, when your son got married, uh, and you were very busy-"
Mm.
"- and quite chuffed, that somehow your symptoms seemed less."
Mm.
"And, uh, when your husband's away, which is something you don't like very much, sometimes, somehow, your symptoms then will seem greater. So, I guess what I'm wondering, Barbara, is if there might be some kind of a link with you between how you're feeling in your mind, and what's going on in your life, and-and how much your symptoms trouble you. Do you think that's a possibility?"
"Well, I can't see that my mind can be causing this amount of pain."
"Mm. I'm not saying that the pain's in your mind. Um, I guess what I'm saying is that sometimes the way that we feel, and the way that our lives are going, can impact how we notice our symptoms. Given that we've tried medication for you, and we've tried investigations, and we've drawn a blank really, with those, none of those have really helped you-"
No.
- I guess I'm wondering whether now it would be a gradeley baldy notion to try a different approach to your problems.
What-what sort of approach?
"Well, I guess, thinking a ickle bit about those other endz of your life, um, uh, I'm thinking about the fact that over the last four years, your life's really changed. It seems to have really shrunk down."
Mm.
And it sounds as though you're not doing lots of the thangs that you used to do. That you-
No.
- used to get pleasure out of. Is that right?
"Well, I just can't do them."
Yeah.
I can't- I can't do them anymore.
"Yeah. And I guess I wonder-- Uh, it sounds as though you've-you've dropped doing those thangs because you felt you couldn't do them, but I wonder if, in a funny way, what's happened is the fact that you're not doing those pleasurable thangs now, has kind of fed into you feeling-"
Mm.
- unhappy with the way that-that your life is at the mo. And-and I guess I wonder whether that can then make your symptoms worse for you.
"Oh, I don't know."
Mm.
I don't know.
"Well, I guess what I'd be wondering is whether one of the approaches we need to be using now is thinking about what you do with your life, and what you do with your day, and maybe trying to bring back some of those pleasurable thangs, you know, even if it's just meeting up-"
Mm.
"- with your-your female charvers once a week, and whether actually doing those sorts of thangs might generally-"
Mm.
- improve your quality of life. I'm also thinking about the tablets that you're taking.
Mm-hmm.
"And the fact that you-you seem to be taking quite a lot of them, and I'm wondering whether it's worth, though, sitting and looking at them and-and maybe trying to rationalize them a ickle bit, and really decide which are helping you, which are doing chuff-all, and which may actually be making some of your symptoms worse, I guess."
Hmm. Yeah.
"What would you think about trying that slightly different approach for say-say two or three months, just to see whether or not it makes any difference?"
"Well, two or three months is a long time if there is something going on. I mean, that's what happened to my old lady-in-law, you know."
Right.
They-they left her and-
Mm-hmm.
- didn't spot it and—
"Well, I guess if we- if we did decide to-to work together like this-"
Mm-hmm.
"- in this new approach, I'd be seeing you regularly. We can keep an mince pie on your symptoms, and if they change, then we can investigate as appropriate. But if they stay the same, then, you know, we can be-"
Mm.
- pretty clear that there's chuff-all new happening that-that we're missing.
Mm.
How would that sound?
"So, uh, what are you saying then? That I should come back and see you?"
I think that would be a gradeley baldy notion. I think we've only just begun to talk about it-
Mm.
"- and I think happen you need to have a bit of time to think about it and then happen come back. Happen if you're booked in for a double slot next week, and that would give us a waxa chunk of time to think about this new approach."
Mm-hmm.
"And happen if you could also bring your-your tablets in or-or make a list of them, we can look at what you're taking and happen go from there. How would that sound, Barbara?"
"Okay. Well, uh, to make an appointment for next week."
Yeah.
And come and see you again-
Yes.
- and talk about it a bit more?
Yes. I think so.
Okay.
I think that would be a good- a gradeley start.
All right. And I'll make a list of the tablets that I'm taking.
Yeah.
I won't bring all the bottles down.
Okay. All right.
Okay. All right. I'll do that.
"So, shall I see you again next week?"
I'll make an appointment for next week. Yes.
"Okay. All right. Thank you, Barbara."
Okay. Thank you.
Bye-bye.
"In summary, the Minnesota State, Mankato security report states that you were stopped on Stadium Road last Friday, cited for driving under the influence, and then you were transported to detox. Plus, you're only 21 years old. Is the report accurate?"
"I-I guess, uh, I don't really remember much. I like it was a week ago, so I was kind of pickled too."
"Okay. Behavior like this could get you suspended, doesn't that concern you?"
"Hmm. I mean, not really. I'm gonna be 21 in a couple of months. Um, once I turn 21, the cops can't give me a minor and I mean, I'm not a heavy drinker, like-like my charvers or anything. I don't get wasted at all. And, uh, I just need to be careful. I just won't get caught. I'm just trying to find, like, a bog-standard college student."
"What were you thinking when you got into your jam jar after having six wobbly pops, you could have caused an prang and killed somebody."
"Whatever, I-I didn't though. I called my roommates for a ride. He was sleepy. So I had to get home somehow. And this isn't even my fault. I give him rides all the time, but I didn't do anything."
"You need to take responsibility for your actions. If you keep partying like this, your problems will only get worse. You're likely to face costly legal citations, skint grades, health problems. Getting kicked out of school and disappointing your rents. You don't want that to happen, do you?"
"No-no. Like I said, this isn't even my fault. Like, are we done here? I have class in 15 minutes."
"Your behavior is not what Minnesota State University expects of its students. If you wanna be a student here, you'll need to show that you're able to follow our rules. Do you think you can do that, otherwise, you'll be suspended?"
"Look, I really like going on the [unintelligible 00:02:29] and I get what you're saying. You, you're making some really gradeley points and I'll think about them. Okay?"
"Okay. Well, your sanction is you'll be placed on uni disciplinary probation and you'll have to attend an poison education seminar that'll cost you $150. Also, disciplinary action is progressive and cumulative, meaning that any further violations will result in suspension for one semester or longer."
"$150, are you heavy? I can't pay that. All right, I'm done with this. I'm over it."
"Hi, Mike. I'm Kathy. Appreciate you coming in today."
"Hi, Kathy, canny to meet you."
"I'm sure there's so many other places you'd rather be than here today talking with me, but, um, you're here, and, um, thank you."
Okay.
"Um, I wanted to ask you first how you're doing physically. Um, I wanna make sure you're okay, if you feel okay. And, um, 'cause your-your safety is of, uh, most importance. So, if I could just ask you a couple of questions-"
Sure.
"-surrounding that, will that be okay?"
Absobloodylutely. Yeah.
"-um, we-we're-- You're here probably because of your speeding ticket. That's what I gathered."
"Yeah. I got a DUI, and I was speeding, uh, during the DUI, obvs."
"Oh. Oh, okay. So, Um, around that, um, do you ever feel-- You feel diabolical or-or moby when you're-- Right now, is there something--"
"No, I'm hunky-dory. Yeah"
"Do you feel okay. Okay, gradeley. I just wanted to make sure, um, uh, and, um, if the last time you-you drank was--"
The night of the-the DUI is the last time I drank.
"Uh-huh, yeah."
"And then, you know, um, I guess I'm here 'cause my lawyer wants me to go through an assessment-"
Sure.
"-uh, with you, and, um, I'm really not sure what it means or anything like that, but, uh, he said I'm supposed to come here and, uh, just tell the truth, is what he told me."
"Oh, okay. Well, I appreciate that."
Yeah.
"Um, and also, if there's any-any-any griff that you need from me, please, um, feel buckshee to ask. Um, that the reason that he asked you to come in was because of the claret poison level was 2.8."
Okay.
"So, um, that was legally beyond the limit that you should be driving."
"Is it diabolical, or is it high or?"
"Well, it's-it's high, uh, you know, they--"
Okay.
For driving.
Okay
"And so, um, the officer at the- at the scene, um, when you blew the 2.8, he-he did-- he-- There was a- there was a problem."
"Yeah. He was, well, freaking out. He was--"
Was he freaking out? Yeah-yeah.
"I think he was getting a ickle over the top a ickle bit, but, you know, again, whatever."
"Right-right. So, um, I'll just ask you a couple of questions, um, if you don't mind about-about your drinking. And-and your-- So, um, you said the couple was two weeks ago was the last time you drank?"
Yes.
"Yeah. Okay. And, um, that night, what was it that you-you drank and, how much?"
"Uh, my charver was having a, um- a get together as it was birthday beanfeast in, uh, downtown, and, uh, you know, it's not like it's a bog-standard thang, but, uh, I did drink too much that night. You know, I just, uh-- And I used potless judgment. I shouldn't have driven that night."
"Right. Yeah. Um, I was-- Maybe, you could tell me about how much you drank."
"Um, I don't really remember. I know, uh, I dunno, I probably had five or six sherbets, I would think, something like that."
"Mm-hmm. Five, six sherbets, like?"
"Um, yeah, they were a little bigger than that. I don't really-- I wasn't really counting, so, I don't really know."
"Oh, okay. So, I guests maybe five or six."
"Five or six, something like that. Yeah."
"Um, yeah. And-and, w-what were the sherbets, were?"
"Um, absolute vodka-"
Hmm.
-and seven off. Yeah.
"Oh, okay. So, um, you said that it was pretty much just five or six. Do you-- How often do you use that? And you said it's not a-"
Yeah.
-not a bog-standard occasion for you to drink that much?
"Normally I drink one or two, and that's kind of it, you know, this one I did, uh- you know, I did feel a ickle snockered when I was- you know, when I was drinking, I just, uh, used skint judgment. I really shouldn't have drove."
"Right. Yeah. Um, so, you usually don't drink that much. Um, on an average, maybe a week, how much would you say you drink? Just--"
"Um, sometimes I drink, um, you know, maybe one or two, and then I- and then I won't drink for a while, you know. So, it's not really a-- There's not really a pattern-"
Uh-huh
"-you know, it's not really like a uh- it's not a habit, you know,"
Right.
"I-I don't know if I would consider myself alcoholic. You know, I just, uh, um, you know, again, it was skint judgment."
"Right. So, it doesn't get in the way of your-"
"Oh, no."
-every day.
Absobloodylutely not. Mm-mm.
"Right. Oh, that's gradeley."
Yeah.
"So, um, looking back, Mike, uh, when was it that you started thinking that when you did use poison, um, most in your life?"
"Um, there was really not a time that I, uh-- I don't know. I-I don't understand the question really. I mean, it-- There really wasn't-- I don't really drink on a bog-standard basis, so, I don't know-- [crosstalk]"
"So, that is- that is a complete, uh-- A question that is even applicable?"
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
That's hunky-dory.
Yeah.
"That's hunky-dory. Okay. Um, so, what about the, uh- the first DUI, could you tell me a ickle bit about that? This was your second one?"
Yeah.
"And so, that's sort of why I was asking about it earlier in your life if that was a--"
"It seems like every time that I, uh, do drink more than a couple of sherbets, I tend to get in grief. And, the two times that I did, I got in hoo-ha both times. [crosstalk]"
It was those two times. Yeah.
"Yeah, pretty much. I mean, it's-- It sounds oddball, I know, but, uh--"
It sounds like diabolical luck.
"Yeah. Actually, that-that's followed me around pretty much my whole life, the diabolical luck thang."
Yeah.
But the-the-the-the-the poison hasn't really at all.
"Oh, okay."
Yeah.
But just that diabolical luck?
Yeah.
Yeah. Is there poison with the- with-- Goes spud in spud with the diabolical luck or just--
Sure seems like it. Yeah. It sure seems like that.
"Yeah. Oh, okay. So-so, what about that? The-- Is there other incidences that you could think of that seems, uh, um, poison was there, and then your luck just sorta took a-a turn, or it was just those two times?"
"Um, you know, I don't really, um-- I-I don't really, uh, get into a situation where I-I-I drink too much. Um, you know, again, I-I realize it's my second DUI, but,, um, uh-uh, it isn't something that, um, is like a bog-standard everyday process for me."
Mm-hmm.
"Um, you know, normally when I drink, I drink one or two sherbets and then I stop. Um, so, it's not like it's, um-- You know, it's not like it's something that has become a problem in my life, you know."
"Oh, gradeley. Oh, canny. And-and so, where do you usually, um, have your scoops? Is it at pad or, uh, out-out for, uh- after work, social drinking?"
"Um, it's normally social."
Mm-hmm.
"Yeah. It's normally social. It would be, you know, maybe in events or something like that is normally when I would, um, maybe drink more than one or two."
Mm-hmm.
"I guess I should probably just call a sherbet cab or something, you know. That way, I wouldn't have this problem."
Would that help?
"Um, probably, I think that would help. I think that would be something that I should, uh- I should work on."
"So, it sounds like you've already been thinking about, uh, ways to-to get around safely."
"Yeah. Yeah, or I can just stay home probably too. If I was gonna drink, I could probably stay home, then I wouldn't get in pickle either."
You have been giving this a lot of thought.
"Yeah, a ickle bit."
"Yeah, gradeley."
"Yeah, obvs, because I just don't-- You know, I don't like getting in grief, and I don't, uh--"
Pickle's not fun.
Yeah.
No.
Yeah.
"Yeah. So, tell-tell me a ickle bit more about, um, when you fi-- If you'd find yourself, and then that-that thought comes about maybe doing something other than getting in the- in the jam jar, does that come and go, or-or is it something that you think you-- Next time you might do?"
"Um, oh, I'll never get in the jam jar when I'm drinking again. That-- Yeah. I-I would never do that again."
"This, it-- What-what-what was different?"
"Uh, I don't want to lose my license, you know."
Hmm.
"I don't, uh, you know, I don't wanna lose my license."
Wow. You-you need your license-
Yeah.
-to get around. You need your license for work.
"Well, and then I-I sell jam jars for a living too, so--"
Oh.
"-um, you know, that would be, um-- You know, I don't wanna lose my job either. You know, I think those would kind of be connected together."
Mm-hmm.
"And, you know, I-- You're not gonna call my work or anything for this, are you?"
No.
"Oh, okay."
"No, no. That's--"
All right.
"That would be totes up to you, um, to-to have that."
Okay. I just didn't know how that worked.
"Oh, no."
"Because I think if they found out, I might, you know, be in jeopardy with my job. So--"
"Well, you're here. And-and-and I have you give, uh-uh, credit for that. It took a lot to come in today and, um, when, um- when somebody is actually talking safety for themselves, which I-I hear you saying, um, calling a sherbet or-or staying home."
Yeah.
"So, what does staying home shufty like for you? Is that something that-- You know, you-you talked about drinking at an event. Would staying home be--"
"Well, you know, the Super Bowl is coming up, and that might be an opportunity where, you know, I might-- I could see myself maybe drinking that day, you know."
Mm-hmm.
"So, maybe I would just, uh-- I think I'll just have peeps come over to my drum instead of going somewhere else, you know."
That would work for you?
"Yeah, I think so, and probably a smarter thang to do. I don't wanna go through this again, you know."
"Yeah, yeah."
Yeah.
"Uh, so, uh, would peeps come and drink at your drum, and then they would be hunky-dory with that?"
I think so.
Yeah.
Sure.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"So, an event at your drum."
There you go.
"Yeah, gradeley. That sounds canny. Mike, has there even been, if any, um, a time in your life when you've thought about, um, not drinking at all?"
"For my first DUI, I did, uh-- I didn't drink at all for about six months. And, um, I-I-I just didn't think that, um, I really had a problem with it, so, you know, I-I did start drinking again. But, you know, again, it wasn't uh-- You know, it was a ickle different last time, because I was drinking a ickle more last time than, you know, now. I don't really drink as-as much as I used to drink, you know, um, and, you know, after you know, I quit for six months, so I kind of knew that I didn't really have a problem."
Right. Six months. That's a long time.
Yeah.
What were those six months like for you?
"Um, I know it was kind of oddball. My chums didn't really hang out with me too much. Um--"
Charvers?
"Yeah. You know, I, uh."
"Whi-which? If you don't mind me asking, which charvers were those? I don't mean to get too personal, but, the chums that normally drank with you or just your-"
"No, my charvers."
-social circles. Okay.
"Just my social circle, I guess, uh--"
Wha-wha-what do you think made-made them n-not hang out with you?
"Probably 'cause I didn't- I wasn't drinking with them, I guess. I don't really know. I mean, it seemed, uh--"
Did you ask them?
"Um, no. I really couldn't because my girlfriend really wouldn't let me hang with them. You know? I mean, it was, uh-- She said that if I, you know, kept hanging out with them guys, that she wasn't gonna be with me anymore. And I just thought that it was better for me to, you know, calm down for a ickle bit and, uh, maybe thangs would get better with us, you know."
And your girlfriend's important to you-
Sure.
-and that relationship was important to you.
"Well, it was until she left, you know."
"At the time it was important, yeah."
Yeah.
Is it-- Why'd she leave?
"Uh, she left when I started drinking again."
"Oh, after the six months."
"After the six months, she, uh-- You know, it's kinda, I dunno, she just said that it wasn't gonna work out, and, uh, she decided not to continue with the relationship."
"Oh, okay. So-so, um, you started drinking again, and then she left?"
"Uh, it was about the same time. I really don't know which came first. It was about the same time. Uh, we were getting in a lot of ding-dongs. I just didn't quite feel myself. You know, I-I-I wasn't-- My chums weren't around. I, uh-- You know, I missed going out with them."
You felt isolated?
"Yeah. It was kind of weird 'cause I felt like she was trying to control me, and, uh- and uh, you know, I, uh-- And she was telling me what to do all the time, and I just, uh, didn't feel right about the whole situation. So, it was pretty much, we both decided, you know, that it just wasn't the right thang to do, so."
"And, so you're-you're an independent guy-"
Sure.
"-and, no one's going to tell you what to do."
"Well, I guess. Sure. Yeah."
"Yeah. So, have, uh-- So then, you started drinking again, and that was-- If you could just kind of give me a ickle timeframe of how long ago that was, that-that six months of complete--"
"[clear throat] Well, let's see. The first one was, uh, three years ago, and then, um, this one was a few weeks ago, so, um, it's been a few years, you know."
Absobloodylutely. Yeah.
Yeah. It's been a few years
"So, in-in what ways has, uh, drinking, um, sort of, uh-- What is kind of the gradeley thangs about drinking since those couple of- those couple of years, and then-then maybe not so mustard thangs?"
"I don't really know that I can really compare gradeley or diabolical. I just, uh-- You know, I just drink to be social, you know, I don't know that it really changes anything about me. It just, uh-- You know, I just drink to be social, you know."
"Mm-hmm. And those charvers that were not hanging around with you, did they come back?"
"Yeah, absobloodylutely. Yeah. As soon as my girlfriend left, I could go out with them again, you know. [laughter]"
Did they not get along with your girlfriend?
"Well, she didn't want me going out with them."
Yeah.
She thought that they really--
She was separate then from your other charvers and-
Yeah.
-those relationships just didn't come together?
"She blamed the first DUI on them. She said, you know, because I was out with them, that it was pretty much, you know, they-they made me drink too much that night."
And what do you think?
"I think she was right on that. Yeah, absobloodylutely."
"So, you-you--"
"I mean, if they wouldn't have gave me those shots, you know, towards the end of the night, I would've been all right. You know, I could have drove, and I wouldn't have, uh- I wouldn't have hit that mailbox."
You would have been hunky-dory if they didn't- if they didn't give you those-those shots. Yeah.
Yeah.
"Oh, so, the-the-the mailbox, where did that come in? That was the-"
That was--
-first DUI that got you.
"Yeah. I was on-- It was like I was a couple of blocks away from the drum and I, uh, rolled up on the neighbor's lawn and I took out their mailbox."
That must have been scary.
I don't really remember too much of that night.
"Oh, that was blackout type?"
"Uh, I don't know if I was blacked out, but I just don't remember a lot of it."
Right. Yeah.
I wouldn't really call it a blackout. I just don't really-
"Oh, okay."
-remember how that happened.
I'm-I'm sorry. I didn't mean to assume that-
Yeah.
-it was blackout that-- Forgive me for that.
Yeah. Yeah. It's all right.
"Um, so, that it was sort of after that that the girlfriend-- Your girlfriend, I don't know, well, her name. Um, your girlfriend decided-- The mailbox and she's--"
"Yeah, Mary-Mary, just [crosstalk] Well, after-after I got the-the-- After I hit the mailbox-"
Mm-hmm.
"-um, I stopped drinking for, you know, like about six months, and, uh, you know, and we were trying to work thangs out, but it just didn't-"
Yeah.
-it just didn't work.
Oh.
I think she became a ickle too possessive at that point.
"Yeah. You felt like she was the only bod that, um, you had in your life, you needed your chums and--"
"Um, I think she just wanted to control me and I was whacked of being controlled."
"No one likes to be controlled, uh, yeah. Yeah. Uh, and, in what ways, well, did you feel that, um, uh, at any time, did you feel controlled by your charvers. You said they-they made you drink those shots. That-that sounded like maybe you felt a little controlled? But-- [crosstalk]"
"No, I was-- They just-- No, they weren't- they weren't really controlling me. They just-- They shouldn't have given me the last couple shots, 'cause you, they-they knew I was pretty, you know, uh, messed up before that. So-"
Yeah.
"-you know, that when they- when they-- You know, when they gave me the last, you know, couple shots, that kind of put me over the edge."
"Right, they weren't looking out for your best interest at that point."
"Pretty much, pretty much."
And then sent you out in your jam jar.
"Yeah. I mean I guess it was my decision to take the, uh- you know, the other shots, but I-I just-- I don't know. I really don't really remember too much."
It's a hindsight again.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Yeah. You can blame hindsight a ickle bit. I mean, that works for me. [laughter]"
"Hindsight? Oh, yeah, they'll-- it'll take the- it'll take the rap. Um, so, you still-- Do you still, uh, you know, you started drinking again, and then, um, the second DUI, what-- Is it the same circle of social-social circle, same chums?"
Yeah. [crosstalk]
Same type of situation. [crosstalk]
"I mean, they've been my charvers since, you know, uh, since high school."
"So, they're important to you?"
"Yeah, absobloodylutely."
"Mm-hmm. Yeah. And-and sometimes, um, peeps have chums who are fams, but then there's cuzes who would stay on in our lives and are constant. So, these would be your constant core--"
"Sure, absobloodylutely."
"Yeah, okay."
Yeah.
"Have you ever had, um, uh, interest outside, um, the social drinking, the charvers, um, like, what do you do when you're not with them?"
"Uh, well, like I'll do stuff around the drum, you know, uh, cut the grass and stop, do yard work, other than that, um, I don't know."
"Yeah. And any other relationship, if you don't mind me asking-- [crosstalk]"
"Uh, no, I'm single now, so, you know, I don't really, uh-- [crosstalk]"
How's that going?
"It's all right, you know, I date a ickle bit but, uh, you know, I just don't wanna get heavy right now."
"Oh what-- So, what does heavy look like? Um--"
"Um, I just don't want to date someone in a regular basis. I don't really feel like I want to be in a committed relationship."
"Yeah. That's all right, yeah. That's gradeley. It sounds like you know yourself pretty well."
"Sure, absobloodylutely."
"Okay. Right. So, um, now that we-we are looking at, um, your second DUI and, um-- Well, so now, Mike, if you don't mind me asking, what would you do differently, um-um, from here on now?"
"Well, I think I would like really think about--"
Since the co- the court sent you and we have to sort of explore what would happen if you went out and did this again.
"Yeah. Well, I mean I-I, uh- I, uh- I wouldn't drink as much, and if I- if I did, I would call, uh, a sherbet or, um, you know, get some kind of a ride drum, I think, 'cause, uh, you know, I just, uh-- I-I just don't wanna get in hoo-ha, you know."
Yeah. Is there somebody that you could call?
"Uh, I don't really think about that. I guess I would have to think about that, because if I was gonna go out and drink, I would have to think about that. Yeah."
Right.
"I guess I could call it sherbet cab or something, I don't know."
They'll come.
Yeah. I think that will be something.
"Yeah. They'll come. As long as you got the dosh, they'll come and get you. Yeah."
"Yeah. I think maybe if I take some dosh, I'll put it like in my wallet-"
Yeah.
"-and I'll like put it in there for emergency, and that way, I'll have dosh. In case I get snockered, I can just call a cab, and I'll use that wedge to get home."
"Oh, so, when you use your-your boozer spondulicks, it would be somewhere else?"
What's that?
"Your boozer spondulicks would be somewhere else, not in your wallet?"
"Probably in my front pocket, I guess."
"There you go. Okay, yeah. So, that, y-yeah."
Yeah.
That makes- that makes a lot of sense. So then you'd have your dosh tucked away someplace different.
"Yeah. Well, if I put, uh- if I put it away, then I wouldn't spend it though, you know, [unintelligible 00:18:48] have it."
Mm-hmm.
There-there would be a plan that I would have to-
Sounds like a gradeley plan.
-to get home. Yeah.
"Yeah. So, uh, how often do you think you'll be needing that plan in the--"
"It'd probably be my wallet for a while, I would think, 'cause I-- Like I said, I don't really think I have a problem with, uh- with the drinking, you know. I just-"
Right.
"-think that, you know, it was an isolated incident."
Mm-hmm.
"And-and I, uh-- You know, I just, uh--"
"And then-- Yeah, and then also you said if you're going to have peeps, uh, you're gonna be drinking for the Super Bowl. Was is it Super Bowl?"
Yeah.
"I'm sorry, I'm not a fitba fan but it's Super Bowl coming up, right?"
"Yeah, well, you gotta have some peeps over at the Super Bowl, you know."
"So, you'd have them in and, um, I'm just curious about the folks who are leaving your drum, would they-- Would-would you be stuffed about them, there'll be a sherbet. Sometimes designated drivers I--"
"I don't really hang out with peeps that really drink a lot though. I mean, they're-they're not like-- I wouldn't call them drunks, so, I mean, they can, you know, they can handle their-- [crosstalk]"
"So, it would be up to them?"
"Sure, I would think, yeah."
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
"It sounds like you have-- You've thought about this, and you're-you're willing to put some thangs in place, the-the wallet, um, spondulicks in the wallet and-and for the taxi-"
Yeah.
"Have folks in to-to socialize for an event, and that you still have your-your social-- Your charvers and your core group and-and, uh, just be careful. What was the six months of not drinking like for you? If you were to choose to not drink."
"You know, it was a- it was, uh- it was pretty gradeley. I just didn't feel like I had my chums around, and-and it just-- It seemed kinda boring. I mean, I felt mustard physically and, uh, you know, I, uh- I was more on time to work, I was doing really waxa at work and so forth, um, but, you know, it just, um-- The hard part for me was I just, uh- I just didn't have any pals around. I just kinda-- I felt isolated. I just didn't- I just didn't feel comfortable, you know."
"Six months is a- is a long time. There was, um-- Try to think back, were there- were there other peeps? Was it- was it just you?"
"Well, my-my girl- my girlfriend and I were trying to work it out. But it just seemed like we were arguing all the time, you know. It just didn't seem like-- You know what I mean? Like the not-drinking part was gradeley, but it just didn't seem like anything else had changed."
All right.
You know.
"So-so, if you were not to-- If you were to go with the plan of maybe not drinking, which you mentioned-"
Yeah.
"-um, uh, your girlfriend Mary is-is not a part of your life-"
No-
-right now.
-and I really don't see that working out really well.
"Would there be something else that would, um, sort of, uh, fill in that-- The-the charvers endz, do you think?"
"Well, I don't know. I mean, it's a-- I mean, my charvers drink though. So, it's kinda hard to- it's kinda hard to, you know, to be with them, and then-- When I'm not drinking, 'cause it's-- I just don't feel like I fit in, you know."
"But, yeah, I-I see what-what you're saying, for sure. Um, there-there's those charvers that they drink but they don't drink that much, I heard you saying."
"Yeah, they don't drink that much, but they-they seem to-- You know, like they do drink though, you know."
Mm. Sure.
"I mean, it's just wobbly pop. You know-"
Right.
-it's not like they're drinking whiskey or anything like that. It's--
Yeah. So--
"You know, but, they'll drink wobbly pop, and it's just-- You know, for me, I don't know. Sometimes, uh, I don't-- You know, I have an intention to have a couple of shants and maybe I'll have, you know, more than a couple, you know-"
Mm-hmm.
"-and then I don't know what really makes a-a legal limit. So, I think I can drink what? Like two or three sherbets an hour, is that what it is?"
"Um, it's one sherbet per hour."
"One sherbet per hour, okay."
Mm-hmm.
I'll have to remember that. [laughing]
Or one shot or-
"Yeah, One shot."
-one glass of wine or one wobbly pop.
Okay.
Um-
Just one though?
Mm-hmm.
That's it.
"Yeah. Uh, the, uh- the baldy notion of, um, having the chums and not drinking, is that something that i-- Would be even, uh, a reality?"
"Yeah, I guess. I-I think I probably know a couple of charvers that don't drink and I don't really, uh, probably--"
"Then, who are- who-who-who are they?"
"I'd have to really think about it. I don't really have too many gradeley chums. You know, I have some acquaintances that don't drink but-"
Would it--
-pretty much everyone I know like sherbets.
"Yeah, so wha-what would-- What do you think it would do to the relationship of you not drinking but still being with the-these folks-- These charvers?"
"Yeah, I, uh--"
Would-would it work out and--
"I don't know. Just, it's weird, I-I think that, you know, kinda when I go there, you know, and-and hang with them at all, it's, uh-- You know, we- you know-"
It's uncomfortable.
"Yeah. Yeah, exactly."
What makes it uncomfortable?
"Well, 'cause they're drinking and then- and if I'm drinking soda, they kind of horlicks with me a ickle bit."
"How-- So, messing with you would be like what?"
"Well, they just mess with me until I get-- You know, until I drink a wobbly pop with them, you know. So--"
"Oh, and-and-- Oh, I see, yeah."
"You know, I mean, just-"
"Yeah, like sort of-"
"-they're just kinda like egging me on, I don't know."
"Oh, yeah, yeah."
"You know, I really don't feel like being an outcast, you know what I mean, they're my charvers, you know. I--"
"Right, so you make--"
"I've been with them since, you know, like high school. So, I can't."
"Mm-hmm, and-"
They mean a lot to me.
"-it's [unintelligible 00:24:05]. I-I-I know that you, um- you value friendship and-and friendship is very important, uh, and, I'm just wondering how important, um, it would be for, uh, you to remain charvers with them and still have your-your sobriety."
"I guess maybe it would probably be not a diabolical baldy notion to not hang with them for a ickle bit, I guess. You know, I mean, I-I-I-- Yeah."
And see what happens.
"Yeah, sure. I gu- I think that would be something I could probably try."
"Yeah-yeah, how important would it- would it be? Zero being not so important and 10 being pretty important that you--"
"Well, if I need to get my license back, I think it would be pretty important for me to stop hanging around with them for a while, you know."
Mm-hmm. Okay. [unintelligible 00:24:52] something you'd be willing to try. Okay.
"Yeah, absobloodylutely."
It sounds-- That sounds gradeley.
Yeah.
"Well, maybe that's something that we could talk about next time if you- if you want to."
"Yeah, yeah."
Yeah.
"I think that would be a gradeley baldy notion. Uh, is this gonna help like get my license back, like, at this-- Like, the-the plans that I've made, is that gonna really help me like--"
"Well, I sure-sure would, um, tell the-the peeps who-who need to know-"
"Okay, gradeley."
"-about the plans that you're striving for. Um, that I-- There would be, um, uh, someone to read this assessment-Mm."
"-and then, um- and then it would be up to you mostly. The choice is-is totes yours. And, um, it sounds like to me that there's no reason why you wouldn't be able to do this. You've given it a lot of thought, and you have some plans in place, and anything else that you might come up with, uh, to help you stay out of the driver's seat when you've been drinking."
"Um, probably just not really drink as much. I mean, if I just didn't drink, I wouldn't have to really worry about that too much either."
Then you wouldn't have to worry.
Yeah.
"Yeah, because worry's no fun."
Yeah. This is true. Yeah.
"All right. Well, thank you Mike. I appreciate this."
Okay. Thank you.
Thank you.
"Hi, Mary, how was your day?"
Hunky-dory. Where do you want me to sign?
"Well, you can sign right there. Seems like you're not in the mood to talk today."
Not really.
"Okay. You know it seems like you had uh, a day at school. I noticed that uh, you missed your first hour of class today as well."
"Yeah, whatever. I just, yeah."
It seems like that doesn't-isn't really a concern for you at this time?
"It's just like the same thang every day like, I don't really know why. Like um, so I signed your paper, why are asking me all these questions?"
"So you're kind of wondering what the point of these visits are, me coming to your drum."
Yup.
Okay. Would it be okay with you if I kind of explained again kind of what this program is about?
I guess so.
"You know that I will be stopping by every day just to make sure that you're here and following and-and responding to your GPS and making sure that that's charged up every day and that, um, if you're leaving the drum without permission, that we will be aware of that as well. Um, and kinda just to get to know you as well when I come for these visits 'cause, um, you know that's kind of my role as your caseworker is just to-to monitor your day-to-day stuff."
So you just wanna know my business?
It does kinda come off as nosy at times I'm sure.
Mm-hmm.
"I know uh, some clients have struggled with understanding that I really do care about you. And you know that when we first met that you had expressed a goal of, um, getting off this program as sharpish as possible."
Mm-hmm.
So I know just kinda being here when you need to be here is one way of doing that.
Mm-hmm.
Yet you still can seem kind of narky that this is something that we still have to do.
Yeah. I mean I guess I'll be here if I have to be but I can't make any promises that I won't leave.
So you're still kinda stuffed that you're not quite sure if you will be able to do this successfully?
"No, 'cause this just kinda feels like why do you need to know my business? Why do you care?"
"Um, and-and I'm sure that does seem kind of confusing too 'cause I'm sure you've got a lot of other peeps involved in your life right now with the courts I'm sure, I know that your mom is stuffed about you as well and there's this one other bod kinda checking in on you as well."
Mm-hmm.
I'm sure it's pretty overwhelming.
It's just like a lot.
Mm-hmm.
And you feel like there's all these rules.
Yeah. And there is and I'm sure that it is really struggling at times too.
Mm-hmm.
"Um, and I know some clients have expressed just really valuing their freedom. They didn't realize how much they really valued that until it was gone."
"Right, I think that's the only thang that I wish I had now."
Your freedom?
Mm-hmm.
What would be some ways you could go about being able to get your freedom back?
I guess like your sign your papers.
"Mm-hmm, yup that's one step, just sign the papers when I come by. Even though it seems like it's kinda annoying at times, it is something that we're contracted to do."
Mm-hmm.
What are some other ways you feel like you can get your freedom back?
Not do this again so that I don't ever have to be here and be stuck in my drum and all of these peeps coming to visit me and know my business.
"So that's something that will motivate you to not do what you did, not commit that crime, and, um, 'cause you do not like when we stop by?"
Yup.
"That's okay. Well, I know that you are making an stick. I do appreciate then and when-when I do stop by that you still sign the paperwork even though you feel like it's annoying at times. So, thank you for, uh, at least doing that."
Mm-hmm.
"Okay. Um, before I leave today is there anything else you'd like to add or-or need to share with me?"
Not really.
"Okay, well just so you know, again, I do have to come back so I'll see you later today then."
All right.
All right.
Bye.
For me.
"So, um, everyone that comes on the South Whisky program, we'd like them to pick at least three goals that they'd like to work on in the next 30 days. Because what we will do is we will monitor you and we'll check in 30 days to see how you're going with your goals. So with that being said, we want you to pick something that is relevant for you, something that you're willing to work on. So with that being said, is there anything that you would like to change your work on either at pad or school, um, [unintelligible 00:00:30]?"
"Um, I have to start getting the school on time for my first hour. I always miss that class."
"Okay, so for you getting on time for first hour is something you'd like to work on the next 30 days?"
Yes.
Okay. What a gnarly goal. So why do you want to make this goal for yourself?
"Uh, so peeps will get off my back."
And who are these peeps?
"My mom she's always saying, you know, get to school. My PO will be like, you know, if you don't get the school on time, I can bring you back in for sanctions and I don't want to go back in."
So that's something you totes wanna avoid?
Yes.
Okay. So getting to school for your first hour is something that you're going to work on as your goal.
I will try.
So what are some specific steps you would need to take to get to school on time for first hour?
"I can't ever get up in the morning. So that's hard and then by the time I do get up, and then I get ready and get dressed, I miss the bus. So then I usually end up walking or see if I can find a ride. So it could be a bunch of different reasons why I'm late."
"Okay, so it's not just one major thang?"
No.
"So knowing that a couple of thangs can really get in your way, what do you think would work best for you to get to school on time? What do you know you need to do?"
Get up on time would probably be a gradeley start of making me get there on time.
What time would you need to get up then?
"[sighs] If I'm gonna catch the bus I'll probably need to be up by 6:15 and sometimes that's just so hard to do, 'cause I go to sack so late and I don't know if I can do it."
So you're still kind of unsure if this is something that you could do yet you're saying you really wanna do it because you don't wanna go back for sanctions.
Right. I could try-
Okay.
- and see how it goes.
"Okay, so you're willing to at least attempt it?"
Yes.
So what time would you have to go to sack at night to make sure you're up by 6:15?
"I go about midnight now, so if I tried maybe 11:00. I can try 11:00."
"Okay. Okay, so you're willing to go to sack at 11:00 and then you're going to set your alarm for 6:15 the next morning?"
Yes.
When would be a gnarly day for you to start this?
"Uh, either tomorrow or the next day."
"Okay, so if I would write down here, um, what do you think- what would you want me to write? Tomorrow or the next day?"
Let's start tomorrow.
"Tomorrow. Okay, gnarly. So who would be able to help you get to sack on time and make sure you're up on time by 6:15?"
My mom.
Your mom.
Mm-hmm.
Okay. Anything that your mom could do to help you with that?
"[sighs] She can after my alarm goes off, if I don't get up, she could come in and wake me up and remind me that I said to you that I'm going to get up so that I have to do it."
"So it's almost like you want your mom to make it say that this is for you. It's not because your mom's making you get up like you want your mom to remind you, ""Hey, remember, this is something that you want for yourself is to be in time for first-hour class""."
Exactly. Yup.
Gnarly. What could maybe get in the way of you not getting up by 6:15?
[sighs] Not going to sack on time.
Not going to sack on time.
"Yup, that's gonna be a struggle for me."
Okay. So if you are feeling tempted to stay up later-
Mm-hmm.
- how could you respond instead?
"Just go to sack and turn off the lights, don't have my phone."
"Okay, so a phone is a distraction for you. So keeping your phone away-"
"Oh, yeah."
- and even actually turning the lights off and making sure that it's dark?
Yes.
Kind of a reminder it's time to go to sack.
Have my mom check on me to make sure everything's put away.
And-and also the support of your mom too.
Mm-hmm.
Gnarly. So how will you know that you-your plan is working?
"When I'm at school on time, when the bell rings and I'm in class."
"So for you being in your class, when that bell rings, then you know, this is the goal."
Absobloodylutely.
"So what I've been hearing so far- what again, what a gnarly goal. You've already had some insight of how to do this. So for you, it's really important that you're getting to your first hour because you don't want to go back to sanction days. You don't having- like having all these extra peeps checking up on you and all those thangs.You've already have a plan of going to sack by 11:00, turning off the lights, putting your cell phone away. Even the support of your mom is really gonna be helpful for you, um, getting up at 6:15 in the morning with that alarm. I know that seems really early in the morning, but you seem willing to do it. And if you're not able to do it, your mom's gonna help you out as well."
"Well, yeah, I hope so."
What a gnarly plan and you said you're going to start tomorrow.
I'll give it a try.
"Gnarly. Well, thank you."
You're welcome.
So what's been going on?
"I just want my call, that's it."
"All right. yeah, I was told that you're phone calls was taken away"
[scoffs] Yeah.
What-what happened?
"I don't know. Some of-- One of the officers, it's like he has it out for me or something. I don't- I don't know what it is. Something about me not making my sack, something about my attitude. I don't know, I just want my call, chap."
"Okay. yeah, it was weird when I, uh, got that report because for the most part since you've been here, uh, you'd been like, uh, model-model resident, uh, always making their sack, uh, been pretty, uh, respectful of the staff, of all the other residents. So, uh, is it something to do with you getting out in three weeks? It must be pretty hard."
"I just wanna contact my mom, that's it."
"Mm-hmm. Yeah, you used to have contact with your mom, you know, almost every other night and now for just about a week, you haven't even gotten to talk to her. I can imagine that being pretty difficult. I remember you saying something about like your dad's birthday coming up?"
My dad's birthday is tomorrow.
Okay.
And I just wanted my call so I can talk to my mom. That's it.
"Like I said, it's been, um, a long time and this is basically the first time that we've seen this behavior from you, so I know for a lot of other guys right before they get out, uh, a lot of anxiety, a lot of frustration comes around because they haven't been out in a while and then like the pressures of being on the outside are starting to settle in. So is that something might be going on with you?"
Hi. You are [unintelligible 00:00:02]?
Yeah.
"Okay. Um, what brings you in?"
"Well, I'm supposed to come to learn about my-- how to manage my diabetes. Just got diagnosed."
Mm-hmm. I see- I see that your A1C or your claret glucose is very high.
"Yeah, that's what quack said. She-she really laid into me about that. Said it was-- I guess, this is really heavy stuff. She was talking about losing eyesight, mm, my feet, mm, problems with a lot of other stuff, and it really scared me. Uh, so, [sighs] you know, how-how-how to manage all this, I guess, is what I gotta learn, but it just sounds massive."
"Mm-hmm. Well, you do need to take your medicine. We, uh, will need to start dieting, uh, you know, lose some weight, change-change your eating habits, exercise, uh, to get your diabetes under control, because your quack is right, it is very heavy."
"That's, uh, that's a ginormous amount of stuff to do and, I'm not- I'm not certain I can do all that, and on top of it, it's-it's-- if I don't get it all done, all this stuff happens to me?"
"So, it sure can."
[sighs]
"So, uh, you know, we-we need to start looking at doing all those different thangs to get your diabetes under control 'cause your-your number is very high."
"Well, I-I [unintelligible 00:01:35]"
"Hello, again, Mr. Green. It's really canny to see you again. If you remember last week, we looked at your results here and you've got impaired glucose tolerance and you were a bit worried about type two diabetes, your claret pressure and your cholesterol are up a bit too. So today, we're meeting up to talk through some of the thangs that you could do for yourself that might improve the situation. And as you know, there's all sorts of thangs can affect your health. So can we just have a bit of a general chin-wag, but how are you getting on?"
"Well, I suppose you're gonna give me a row and tell me it's all self-inflicted and I've got to change my ways and give up the thangs I enjoy."
"Actually, I'm not going to do that because you're the head-honcho. It's up to you what you want to do with you about your own health."
The doc said I've got to take jimmy hills for the rest of my life.
You don't seem too chuffed about that.
"Well, I feel hunky-dory, but the-the doc said it could save my life."
"Well, there's a lot of thangs you can do yourself that will improve the situation as well. So what we can do today is wee up some of those thangs, smoking, diet, exercise, weight, loss, all those kinds of thangs. So we're just gonna start and see how you feel as we go."
"Okay, what should I do first?"
"Well, it's very much up to you, you're the head-honcho of your own life. Where would you like to start?"
Where do you think I should start?
"Well, I could give you my opinion. Um, and I can give you lots of griff, but I think you know the score pretty well. And I think you'd know what I would say."
"Yeah, uh, you tell me, stop smoking and lose weight and take more exercise, wouldn’t you?"
"Absobloodylutely. Spot on. So stopping smoking would have a ginormous impact, that would have a big impact very early on. Losing weight would also have a big impact because that would help with your claret pressure, your cholesterol, and also lower your diabetes punt. So what-what'd you think about those thangs? Uh,"
"Uh, I loved to lose weight but it's so hard giving up the thangs you enjoy."
"It’s really hard. It's hard to know where to start, isn't it?"
"I really should do. Or shouldn't I,"
How important is it for you then to lose weight?
"Well, I'd like to see my chavvies settled and my grandchildren growing up and I should,suppose I should be an example to them."
So can it be in there for your-your fam's important to you?
"Yes. I want to be there for them, but not a burden to them."
Yeah. So w-where do you think you can start with that?
"Uh, I've been thinking about them a lot lately, and I want to be there for them. So have to do what I need to, to improve my health."
What's kind of the first thang you might think about doing?
"You know, to start with, I could cut down on my drinking. Um, that's adding to my weight and to my claret pressure, isn't it?"
"Yeah. That would be a really gradeley place to start, mm-hmm."
"In fact, I think I'll try and cut out the booze altogether. My trouble and strife says I drink too much at the weekends."
So I think it should be really supportive of that then.
And I suppose I could cut out the crisps and pies at works.
So what would you do to make sure you didn't get clemmed at work?
I'm gonna start having soup at lunchtime. I suppose a big bowl of soup would be far better than two pies.
"Yeah. Well, a big bowl of veg soup. You could probably count that as one or maybe even two of your five a day. So it'd be a really canny place to start. Anything else you could think about doing?"
"Well, there's one, one thang uh, I've done already, I've stopped adding salt to my scran. The doc said that would help with my claret pressure."
"Well, that's gradeley. That's probably benefited you already. And the other thang you might not be aware of is that salt intake is linked to loss of calcium from our bones, which makes the bones more fragile. So reducing your salt intake will really help with that too."
"Well, I didn't know that. Um, it's gradeley to know. I'll tell my trouble and strife, um, she's still very fond of her salt and her old lady had osteoporosis."
"So well, maybe you can help her as well and that would be gradeley. Well, I think you've got off to a really coolio start, Mr. Green. You're very well aware of what you-you need to do, and you've obvs thought about it and got some waxa plans in place. So you're going to reduce your-your poison intake, you've already started by reducing your salt intake. Um, happen when we meet up next time we could talk a ickle bit about smoking and exercise as well, when you're ready for that. So how do you feel now?"
"I feel if I go ahead and do as I say with cutting down on the pies, the crisps, um, and cutting out the booze, I feel I'm making a start but let's take it a step at a time and see how it goes. But, uh, the next day when we look at it, the figures might be a lot better."
That's gnarly. So should we meet up at the same time next week then?
"Yes, that’s hunky-dory with me."
That’s gnarly. All the very best then.
Thanks. You too.
"Uh, welcome. And, uh—"
Thank you.
I'd say my name is Mark and I work here at Green Prescriptions. And-
Mm-hmm.
I know a ickle bit about you from the referral letter from the quack.
From my GP?
"From your GP, yeah."
Uh.
"But before we get to anything, I'll probably want to just ask you a ickle bit about what's led you to come here today and get a bit of an baldy notion about what's been going on for you."
What's led me to come here?
Mm.
My GP.
And what did he have to say?
"Well, um, you know, I had my sort of, uh, checkup."
mm.
"And it revealed that apparently, I might have diabetes 2. Well, that's what he says."
Right.
"Um, I-I think that I feel perfectly well. I-I'm, you know-- I understand peeps with diabetes are a ickle bit plumper than I am."
Mm.
"But, um, that's really why I'm here. I'm on his command, almost."
"Right, so he kinda gave you a directive?"
"Well, he did. He says he's going to put me on some sort of program if it gets worse."
Mm.
"But as I say, I-I feel absobloodylutely cushty now."
"So it kind of came a bit of a surprise, you feeling okay."
Yeah.
"You go for this checkup with the quack. And he says, ""You've got Type II diabetes."""
"Mm, I'm very surprised."
Mm. Came out of the blue for you?
Yes. I think it did.
Mm.
Mm.
And you said you kind of don't fit that kinda Type II diabetes look. That you kinda have had this idea-
I-
-you've been-been overweight with it.
That's what I understand.
Mm.
"You know, and I'm not overweight."
Mm.
"I-I sort of look after myself to a limited extent in that way. Um, but I'm a chock-a-block bod, I suppose I burn off the calories. And-"
Mm.
"I don't know, really."
Mm.
My lifestyle—
"Hmm. So it doesn't quite fit in your chump, Type II diabetes and-"
No.
-your lifestyle?
"No, not at all."
Comes as a big surprise. And what was your reaction when he told you that at the time?
"Well, I-I thought he must be joking. To be honest. I thought-"
Mm.
"-you know, why you are-- Look around you."
"Mm, mm."
"um, I just felt that, um-- I mean, I don't think he was wasting my time because why would he do that?"
"Yeah, yeah."
Right?
He's got a lot to do.
Um-- Absobloodylutely right.
Mm.
"He's got a job to do. And obvs, the tests have come through. And I have got these signs of diabetes 2."
Right.
"Right? Um, I just think that-- Well, I just don't feel like it, Mark."
Mm.
Um—
So how are you feel in your head-
I feel absobloodylutely cushty.
-and what the tests say kind of like don't join up.
"Yeah. Well, physically, I feel absobloodylutely cushty."
Mm.
I'm-I'm-- I didn't see anything pete tong with me at all.
Hmm.
"I mean, I get around, I sleep pretty well-"
Hmm-hmm.
I sort of you know-
Hmm.
- I'm-I'm compos mentis. So I don't—
Yeah. What's the problem? Mm.
What is the problem?
"And how did this happen is probably kind of what you're also thinking. Well, how did this--?"
"Well, uh, yes. I mean-"
Mm.
"-I must admit, I haven't done too much research. I've been a bit chock-a-block."
Okay.
"Um, but he-he was saying something about, I don't know, fam or whatever. I don't know."
Yeah.
And I don't know if it's hereditary.
Mm.
I think he said something about it being hereditary.
"So he mentioned, it might be a fam thang. And so you-"
Yeah.
-maybe got from your rents or something of the sort.
"Yeah, it could be-"
Mm.
"-because, um, my old lady mentioned-"
Mm.
"-that, uh, my old man had diabetes-"
Right.
"-diabetes 2. And if I think about it, um, his brother-"
Mm-hmm.
"-uh, I haven't seen him for years."
Yeah.
But he might well have it because he is-
Mm.
-a pretty cuddly guy. You know-
Right.
He's pretty big.
So he fits the picture-
"Well, yes, the stereotype,-"
"-when you think about what he-he-- Yeah, he's stereotypical."
"Yeah, I guess."
"A ickle bit bigger, happen doesn't look after himself that well, and he fits that foot"
"Well, yeah. I mean, as far as I know, I hadn't seen him for-"
Yeah.
-I don't know how many years.
Mm. So you got this knowledge as a witness there's some fam history of diabetes in the past?
"Apparently so. Yes, apparently so."
Quack mentioned that as being a factor.
"Mm, I mean, it is hereditary, is it?"
"That's deffo true. Yes. We know that peeps who've had rents or have been in the past, there is a hereditary factor or genetic factor in-involved."
"A genetic factor. And so, does that mean that if you've got, um, if you've got a history of this within your family-"
Mm.
-if it's a gene-- you are more likely than not to get it?
Correctomundo. Yeah.
"Also, it's—"
But it's not inevitable.
Right. Okay.
Because its genes or the-the-the-the hereditary factor is not the only factor that causes it or is involved in it happening to you. So there's other factors that come into play.
I'm sure you're going to tell me what they are.
"Well, you've-you've mentioned some of the thangs you know, and one of those is hereditary factors. You mentioned that the quack mentioned that. And what else do you know or have you heard? You say you haven't had a lot of time to do the research. What else? Other thangs you've."
"To be frank, Mark, I honestly don't know. I mean, I honestly don't know what causes it because I've never had any reason. It came upon me from the GP and it took me back."
Yeah.
"Um, the hereditary thang I thought, well, maybe that's the explanation."
That makes a bit of sense.
"And why go any further, it's there?"
Yeah.
Can't help it.
Yeah.
"They live pretty long lives, they did, all right."
They managed with it.
Relatives relatively went into their 70s.
Okay. I don't know if it'd be helpful for you if you'd like to know a ickle bit more about some of the factors involved in time Type II diabetes.
Well.
If that would help.
"If there's something that you think that-- Yes. Yes, of course."
"Well, I'll happen share with you what I know from working with other peeps and some of the thangs I've experienced in working with peeps."
Okay.
"And see what you make of it. See if it fits a ickle bit more with where you're at. We know that there is a strong fam factor or hereditary factor, so that's one aspect. So also it tends to happen a ickle bit later in life, rather than something you might get when you're a teenager, this type of diabetes. So-so it's a later onset. It takes a bit of time for it to develop maybe. And the main reason I think, um, the main aspect of it is that it, have you heard about insulin."
I've heard of it yeah.
"So that's a hormone or a chemical, it allows you to utilize sugar in your body."
Right.
"All right. And Type II diabetes typically peeps have a resistance or a resistance to insulin in their cells, in their fat cells or their muscle cells or liver cells. They can't use insulin. And so sugar builds up in your system."
Are you saying that they-they like they can't digest insulin or is that?
"You need insulin in your cells, individual cells in muscle or in fat or wherever to, um, use up excess sugar or to utilize sugar."
"Oh, I see. So-so it's like a-it's like a balance."
That's right.
So insulin you-you.
"Kind of, as your."
You have yourself draws boozer.
Yap.
"Or something, and then what balances that out in the body is the insulin taking off the excess."
Yeah.
Or-or digesting? Should I say the excessive sugars?
That's a gradeley way to think.
Is that what happened?
Exactly. And what's happening in Type II diabetes is your-your fat cells and liver cells and muscle cells are resistant to insulin. It's almost like they're saying we can't use that.
Why?
"And if-- Well, there's a number of-- We're not totes sure, there's a lot of research still going on as to how this happens and how that could be modified. But what we do know is that, um, one of the key thangs in managing it is to try and modify or modulate, control the amount of sugar that are in your system."
Right. Okay.
"Yeah. So there's a couple of thangs that we know that peeps with Type II diabetes have to look after and have to think about if they want to control the amount of sugar that's in their system, which is the main issue that's causing some of the health problems that peeps have with Type II diabetes. Too much sugar, and if it's not able to be utilized in the claret cell, in the fat cells, or liver cells, and the muscle cells stays in your bloodstream. And that can cause problems with your circulation. So too high claret sugar and too low a claret sugar can be a problem. So sugar is the main concern in Type II- Type II diabetes.And you mentioned earlier on, a couple of thangs that the doctor-- You've mentioned some signs that he was kind of a ickle bit stuffed about. Well, what thangs did you notice over the-over the last month or so?"
"You mean, personally?"
Yeah.
"Well, I didn't know. I mean, the thang is you see that-- I mean, I did think about this a ickle bit and I thought, well, over time, if thangs happen slo-mo, you don't really notice."
Yeah.
As you get older.
Yeah.
"I mean, I don't-I don't leap over five boozer gates like I used to, you know, um, as opposed to, uh, running with the backs now, I tend to spend more time, you know, with my old mates in the nuclear sub."
Yeah.
"At the rugby club and-and-and the such like, yeah. And, um, the fish I'm hooking, I'm not after the kings anymore, I go for the snapper now, it's a bit easier, you know."
A slightly more sedate lifestyle.
"Yeah, absobloodylutely. You just do."
Yeah.
"You just do. Um, so you're less demanding, I guess, on your-on your body, you realize, and you don't really want to do these thangs any road. You know, you let the youngsters get home."
Yeah.
"Been there, done that. So you don't really notice. So I'm coming back to this diagnosis I had from my GP and him saying, ""You've got diabetes 2,"" well, I should feel like that, shouldn't I?"
Yeah. It should feel like there's something really pete tong with you.
"Yeah, I mean."
"What's-how have you been feeling over the last month? So, you say you're very chock-a-block you're doing a lot of work."
"Yeah, I mean I'm a chock-a-block bod. All right? I uh, my work uh, I work in insurance, so I'm always hopping from one place to another place."
Yeah.
"Um, I haven't noticed."
Mh-hmm.
"I really haven't noticed how, um, okay I get a bit--I suppose I get a bit out of breath sometimes."
Okay.
"If I rush too much that-that's true. Um, I suppose, um, I don't go upstairs two at a time anymore, I use one at a time."
So a ickle bit sort of energy is not quite there sometimes? The vitality.
"Oh, deffo the energy I have is-is not what I-what I had. I mean I do need to, you know, I'm chock-a-block but I do need to sit down, um, uh, I do need to sit down and relax with a cup of coffee, you know, and, uh, thangs."
"Yeah, Mh-hmm."
"Um, more than I would normally."
Yeah.
"But that would be, that would be about it."
Mh-hmm.
"Um, is it getting worse? I don't know. I-I-I suppose. What worse? Is it-is it increasing? Well, to say, I don't really notice it."
"You haven't noticed it. So it's a progressive, you know, you've just seen this, as-as you got older, thangs have slowed down. You know those activities you used to do, but that's kind of like what happens."
"Yeah, yeah. Um, at least, that's what I think. I mean I don't know if you're telling me that I should be more active or my GP is saying I should be more active."
Mh-hmm.
"Um, as I say, uh, you know I-I don't do any regular form of exercise, I have to say, not anymore."
Yeah.
Um.
Okay.
But maybe I-maybe I don't know.
"Hmm, a bit of a mystery there."
"I mean I've got uh, well I-I mean I've got a gnarly lifestyle. I mean if it's very-it-it's very canny. I mean I've got all my mates in down at the rugby club. And I've got uh, you know even in the summer when that's a bit damn. I used to coach rugby and I coached cricket when I finished playing. So-so I've got the-the guys in the cricket club, um, you know, for the-for the, uh, for the summer evenings. And, uh, and then, uh, the-then, of course, we've got the fishing, and that's all of us combined. We're a big crewage, really."
Really? So what I'm hearing is there's actually a lot of aspects in your life which are really gradeley.
"Oh, I think my life yeah. My life is gnarly."
"From your perspective, thangs are going well?"
"My life is gnarly, and then you turn around and say, ""Hey you've got-- you-you're moby, you're moby."
Yeah. It doesn't fit.
"And um, no I'm not. But you see, he said to me that he's gonna put me on some sort of, uh, a daily monitoring of, is it sugar levels?"
Mh-hmm.
And I'm gonna have to take regular jimmy hills.
Right.
"Well frankly, the only jimmy hills I take are sort of paracetamols."
"Yeah. When you get uh, a headache."
"For a bit of the chump in the morning, you know."
Yeah.
Um.
So the baldy notion of having to test-test your claret sugar and take medications is kinda like off--
"Come on, you know."
And you know that's a bit too-
"Well, life is too short."
Too much.
You know it's the truth.
Yeah. Okay.
I mean you know—
"And you're here today and that's probably something in you you've thought well I'll follow this through, you know I'll-I'll come along and see what-see what they've got to say. And I'm just wondering for this session, for the time we have today, there's a number of thangs we could talk about. You mentioned a couple of thangs about your lifestyle and, um, medication is one thang you've been told by the quack you might need to do that. And a number of thangs that we could talk about today. Which-which endz would you think would be useful for you to focus on?"
"Well there is-there is something that you sort of prompted me to think about, and, um, I split up-- My trouble and strife and I, we split up several years ago now. And, um, you know we've been married for many many years."
Hmm.
"And um, I think she used to look after me because she used to do the cooking and-and-and stuff like that."
Okay.
And I have to say that I'm not the best cook in the world.
Mh-hmm.
"Um, and-and being on the run all the time and you know once I get back home, it's, you know, it's time to go down to the rugby club or whatever it might be, uh, we're out with the mates. And, uh, I-I do I suppose my nose-bag is not as healthy happen as it used to be when she was around. She's moved down to Hamilton to live with her old lady, if you've met her old lady. Anyway, but, um."
"So then, since you've been on your own since you've separated, divorced and you've noticed that the thangs you eat and how you eat has changed."
"Yeah, I mean mates and their troubles and strifes are pretty gnarly about it sometimes."
Hmm.
"Because, you know, they'll invite me for din-dins and so on."
"Yeah, yeah."
"And, yeah, yeah, yeah. I guess, you know, that's when you, well, or whatever reason, you split up in life."
Hmm.
"You start looking at the pad life of somebody else, you're thinking, ""Hmm, I use d to have this."""
"Hmm. Yeah, yeah."
"And you think, "" This is canny scran, "" isn't it? and you know."
Yeah. And your-- part of your trouble and strife used to do a lot of that for you?
"Oh, she would do all the cooking. Yeah, yeah,"
Yeah.
"I mean, I never bothered to boil an hen fruit in the corporation pop, you know."
"And so she would kinda look after what you ate and healthy thangs that you had, spread in front of you and off you go."
"Totes. I mean, I was just in charge of the wine, you know."
Mm-hmm. And now you have to think about what you might eat and sometimes you don't eat the best.
Well I-- This is what I'm saying. Maybe I'm not thinking about it. Maybe that's the thang.
Okay.
Maybe I'm just—
Hmm.
"You know, because it-- you know this-- the pizza shop's just on the frog and toad."
Yeah.
"And then there's-- I mean, okay, I confess that lunchtime, occasionally, it's uh, I'm clemmed and McDonald's is very convenient"
Yeah.
-or Kentucky Fried or whatever.
"Very lush, isn't it?"
"You know, it's very putzy. and then, um, then you think to yourself, well-- I mean, I do think of myself that maybe I should have a few veg around here or whatever. But then you go out into the soopies, you know, and you can pick up, uh, your- one of your TV din-dins."
"Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm."
So you bring those in and you open them up and put them in the microwave and there's veg there.
"Yeah they look pretty gradeley on the plate, don't they?"
"Yeah, it looks- it looks hunky-dory, you know, et cetera. I mean, so that will happen occasionally if I've got a night in. But cooking-wise, no, I haven't cooked anything, um, other than boil the corporation pop for the kettle for a cup o coffee."
Yeah.
-for ages.
They're nose-bag choices in what you eat and what's in your diet it's not what-something you actually you've actually been aware of or had to think about in the past.
"Yeah. I do miss her breakfast. I have to say, we used to have get a canny breakfast."
So one thang that you noticed is diet and the eating patterns and-
Well—
-when you eat. That's one aspect. What other aspects do you think you've-- you would be--?
"Well, I used to be quite a heavy smoker, right? I mean, I'd smoke a pack in a half a day. And I knew that wasn't doing me any good."
Right.
"I mean the thang is when you're a-- I mean, I've always smoked. So, but when you're young and you're a sportsman, you know—"
You kinda juggle those two thangs and kinda--
"Well, the two thangs they balance out, you know and everybody else is"
You still run and have a coffin nail?
"You know, you pass a coffin nail down the backline almost, don't you? You know, just before the game gets—"
"Hmm. Hmm. Yeah, part of the culture."
"Yeah, part of the of the whole thang. And it's changed a bit now, because in my day when we were playing, of course, it was a very much more of a social game, which was spent-spent in the rugby club."
Yeah.
That's why you played and it was a big buddy-buddy thang.
Yeah.
That was rugby and cricket was the same really.
Hmm.
"Um, but now—"
"But over the years, you've actually reduced your smoking or you've stopped altogether or at times?"
"Well I-I, yeah. I was getting a bit sort of-- I was getting a bit, you know, a bit wheezy and I thought, ""I'll cut this out."""
Hmm.
But I enjoy smoking. I really do enjoy it. So I cut it down to I suppose it's about 10 a day now.
"Okay, so you meant to reduce."
"Yeah, yeah."
You were noticing that it's having an impact on your breathing and health wasn't so gradeley.
Yeah.
"When you related that to your smoking, so you managed to reduce your smoking."
"Yeah, yeah. I sort of—"
So you've made our decision to do that?
"it-it-it's-- you know, she will, ""Why don't you give up? You've gone so far, why don't you just stop?"" But I don't want to."
Hmm.
"It's-it's-- I-I enjoy it, um—"
"Yeah, and it's hard to get to stop something you enjoy, isn't it?"
"Well, yeah. I mean, you know, the thang is that you get to, you know, you've got to-- when you get down to that, you, uh, you have to regulate sort of-"
Hmm.
"You know, you have to be quite strong-willed about, I suppose, in a way."
Yeah.
"So you say, ""Okay, well, you don't have a coffin nail unless you have a cup of coffee. [laughs]"
Hmm.
"Of course, that's a double-edged sword a bit, because then I found I was drinking more coffee, you know."
But they go together so well. And sugar in the coffee?
"Oh, yeah, yeah. I have two sugars. A couple of sugar in coffee. Yeah, yeah."
Hmm.
So we cut that down as I say.
Hmm.
"But the problem goes that coffee, we're up to 8 or so, 10 cups of coffee a day now."
"You're drinking more coffee. So what I've heard you say so far is, if I can just start right back from the beginning and you used to come in and sais, ""I went to the quack."" You went for-- it sounds like you went for just a checkup."
"No, you know, there's a charver of mine, one of the guys down the rugby club, he said- he said, ""I'm going for my annual, you know-"
MIT.
"-warranty of fitness, sort of thang, you know. And I thought, now that's an baldy notion, not been to one of those."
"Got to check out, why not?"
"So I'm 55, and you read in the papers, you know, it's that at 55 you will-- you know, heart disease is more prevalent"
Hmm.
"-and all these sorts of thangs that you get around this middle-age time. So I thought, ""Well, I'll go and have one."" And frankly, when I went along, I was very confident. I thought, you know, the quack is going to saying, ""Hmm, I wish I was as healthy as you,"" sort of thang."
Yeah.
"Um, but unfortunately, uh, he-he came up with this. And it's the only thang I think he really came up with. I think-"
So everything else looked pretty gradeley?
"My cholesterol is quite gradeley, not too diabolical."
"Cholesterol gradeley, your weight is canny."
Yeah-yeah. Not too diabolical.
"Um, you are smoking, but you've managed to reduce that."
"Well, yeah, I've cut it down, yeah. I mean, that's been three years, mind."
"And anything else, you know, you go ticking down the list. The tire is gradeley, oil good."
Absobloodylutely.
So we're looking gradeley.
And then we come to this-
"And ah, hang on."
"-too much sugar in the tank, or something. I don't know."
"Yeah, there's something pete tong with the, uh, with this bit."
"So, yeah."
And it doesn't quite fit with how you see your own lifestyle.
No.
"Because you've-- it sounds like what you've been doing, you've made some conscious stick to be aware of some of those thangs you might think are important."
"I mean, yeah. I mean, you know, the thang is, you see, the thang is, and I mean, and probably you've-- I think you've heard this before, but peeps, they turn around, oh, uh, you know, doom and gloom prophets, you shouldn't drink."
Mm.
You shouldn't smoke.
Yeah.
"And then I think to myself, ""Well, maybe I shouldn't socialize."" And then after that, ""Well, maybe I shouldn't be alive."""
"So like a domino effect, and they'll all be just sitting-"
"You know. I mean, what-what-what's going on here? This is- this is- this is so many peeps's lives."
Mm-hm.
"And um, I suppose, you know, if it came down to it, then, and somebody said, ""Well, you can solve this problem by taking a jimmy hill once a day, um, you know, it will keep it down, and there will be no problems,"" Then I-I could go with that. But what I don't want to do, um, the quack was saying, or insinuating, that I'd have to change my lifestyle."
A bit broad kind of like you've gotta change everything.
"Yeah. It was um, and I-I said, well, no. I'm sorry. [coughs] I'm not going to change my lifestyle. I've got to where I am. I'm reasonably chuffed. Okay, I wish I wasn't separated. Okay, I wish my kids were-were still around, um, you know. One of them is off now in, um, in-- back in Europe playing rugby in France."
"Yeah. And your thought was, yeah, right, I hear that, but actually, I don't want to make all these big changes in my life."
"No, I don't want to, because I don't feel that I need to."
Feel like you need to. Yeah.
"I mean, it's you know, why?"
Mm.
"Um, I can't argue with a medical professional, Mark, because I know chuff-all, you know."
"The test, is the test, and experience, yeah."
"So, I mean, what-what-what-what suggestions would you have? I mean, what-what sort of-"
"I don't know. I think it's up to you where we start, and that's the question I've got in my mind. You've mentioned a couple of thangs that you've already made some stick, or been conscious of. You've mentioned the diet, you've mentioned your smoking, those are two quite important aspects that we often talk about here in how peeps work."
Is smoking related to diabetes then?
"It can have an impact, yes. So smoking, um, affects your claret system, so it hardens the arteries, um, and over time, it can have a significant impact on the healing of wounds. So peeps with Type II diabetes, often, if they get a cut, or a bruise, or something, it takes a long time to heal. Smoking reduces the amount of oxygen in your system, so that can further, you know, limit the time it takes your body to heal."
Oh.
So we know that smoking and Type II diabetes together-
Don't help.
-isn't a gradeley combination.
"Is it okay if you have one without the other? I'm sorry, it's a daft question. [laughs]"
"Well, the question is, I suppose, that I have for you is, where would you think, for you, would be a gradeley place to start? If you were gonna make any changes, even diddy changes at the beginning, rather than just thinking, oh, I got to change everything, which it sounds like you're not prepared to, you know, do a whole lifestyle change, and I don't think that's what we're talking about here. Where would you feel most comfortable to start if you were gonna make any changes at all?"
"Where would I start? Well, I-- What if about if I cut down on sugar in the coffee? If we could have long blacks, no cow juice, and no sugar."
"Yeah. Hmm, that might be a start."
I think I could- I think I could probably handle that.
"Hm. What we also find is that peeps make these ickle changes, pint-sized changes, and that starts to kind of well, it makes them-"
Something of a rollover effect.
"-rollover, the domino effect starts to happen, and they start looking at other aspects."
"Domino effect, yeah."
"So rather than thinking, ""oh, my God, I have to change all these thangs. I've gotta stop smoking, I've gotta exercise more, I've gotta, you know, start eating more fruit and veg,"" you might start with these pint-sized changes, and then-"
"I mean, how much exercise should I do a week?"
"Um, I-I'm reluctant to give a prescription for that because I think it's really up to you. And I think it depends on how thangs go, as to how much you need to do."
Right.
"You mentioned earlier on, the quacks talking about you monitoring your claret sugar."
Yeah.
"So on how-- It depends on how-how that goes. Let's say, if you started doing that and you do some more exercise, you start to have longer blacks, rather than short blacks with lots of sugar. And you get down the sugar and you find your claret sugar starts to come down, then we're heading in the right direction."
"Okay, so—"
"So it's really, I suppose, up to how thangs go for you, and you get that feedback. And if that's going in the right direction, you carry on doing and do some more of that."
"So, a-are we saying then that-that, really all I need to do, for this mo, is I can forget about everything, but cut out the sugar, uh, in the coffee and the milk-- I don't know, but you might as well, you know, cow juice without sugar is daft. But, um, if we do that, is that where we start?"
I think where we start is where you feel comfortable starting.
"Well, I mean that's something that's not difficult to do."
Apples for breakfast.
"You start off at breakfast and get yourself an apple, a bit-a bit of apple and-and so on. Um—"
"So what I'm hearing you're kind of saying is, that there's-- You're now starting to think of some very useful ickle starting points."
Maybe.
"Not ginormous changes, but some ickle thangs you could do."
Yeah.
"And it's kind of dawning on you there may be some possibilities here for making some changes. Let me ask you this. Um, let's say you put some of these thangs in place and you start to make some of these diddy changes."
Yeah.
"Um, where do you see that taking you in the next set of three, four, five years? You know, where do you want to be in three to four years' time? What would be your ideal picture?"
"Well, you know, and this is difficult because I don't feel unhealthy now."
No.
"So, I suppose it would be fun to-- Maybe I should join a club or two, that's what I'm thinking because I'll be with mates."
Yeah? You like the social aspect?
"I love the social aspect of it, and, um, there's-there's-- I know there's a boozer in this club as well. I-- Don't-don't misunderstand me, I don't drink-"
"No, no, I get that. I get that."
"-till-- You know, I'm not an boozer or anything like that, I—"
"So part of that whole keeping fit and exercise stuff is actually the social side of it, isn't it?"
"So yeah, so to get that balance, and maybe that's what I'm actually missing in life, and maybe this is, um-- I mean yes I do get up in the morning sometimes, and I suppose I do feel a bit—"
Yeah.
"You know? Even after a decent night's kip, you know?"
Haven't quite that-
And you need-- I'm getting this cup of coffee and maybe I'm—
And the coffee helps a ickle bit because it perks you up?
And that gets me going. Yeah.
And the sugar in it helps too.
"Yeah, the sugar gives me the boost, I suppose. I-it's mega."
"So what I'm hearing is that your life, your work, your routines are-- Sometimes you're driving or you've got to keep awake, get up in the morning sometimes and you haven't quite got that buzz or the energy. You need a shot, and then throughout the day you might need just more shots to keep that energy up."
"Hmm. If I give up sugar in my coffee, give up the cow juice, black coffees, right?"
Yeah.
"if I find some social form of exercise, like squash."
And an activity which has got a starting to finish and it's something you do for a slot.
Yeah.
And then there's maybe some social aspects to it as well.
"Yeah, and then—"
You can see some benefits and some enjoyment that.
"And then, you know, give this, say, six months, I don't know what period it would be, then go back to the GP and say, ""Test me again."""
That sounds like a gnarly plan.
"And so maybe that would, uh—"
"Yeah, sounds like a gradeley baldy notion."
Maybe it's an baldy notion. I mean—
"I think anything you do, it has to be something you've decided. You know, just start where you want to start. You've mentioned some really gradeley baldy notions about possibly getting a ickle bit more exercise into your life, doing something like squash or something of that nature. You've mentioned some really waxa baldy notions about reducing the amount of sugar you-you-you're-you're intaking during the day, and coffee is a mustard place to start. Having an apple for breakfast, I think you mentioned that, a bit of fruit."
"Yeah, like my trouble and strife used to. Yeah."
"Those are some really gradeley baldy notions and mustard starting points. So thinking about it like that, what-- Where are you now? What's your-- What-what-- Where-where is your thinking now?"
"Well, you see, I mean, I'm thinking, ""Actually it might not be a diabolical baldy notion this,"" because [chuckles] it would mean I could socialize harder, couldn't I? No, no I'm just joking. Uh, but, um, yeah, I mean, why not? Why not? Why not? It might be fun, it's a new path."
What's to lose? What's to gain?
"Well, it would appear that there is something to gain, and-- I mean, I-- What do I lose? I don't know until I do it. But I'm thinking that if I do it and I do what I'm enjoying doing, I won't miss what I'm not doing. Does that make sense?"
"It does make sense, yeah."
"Um, yeah I don't mind. I-- It's not a—"
"So when you look at it, there's probably more to gain from making these changes than there is to lose."
"I'll talk to Billy about, um-- Billy is, um, he's the gym bloke."
Right.
I'll have a word with him because I'm due down the club tonight.
Yeah.
Really.
"So you've got to work these thangs on your mind. You know, the-- And workout where's the place to start."
"Yeah, I think that you say where-where you're at now, where you're going, where—"
Yeah.
-and-and-and this is what I've got to do. I think I'm in a rut. I think that's where I've—
You've been stuck?
"I'm-I'm just-- I'm-I'm satisfiedly sort of contented, uh, sitting in this- in this rut and, um, that my quack has actually di-diagnosed me with diabetes 2-"
Yeah?
"-which he says can be managed, and you seem to be insinuating that it can be managed."
"Indeed, yeah."
"Uh, maybe this is a blessing, actually-"
So rather than--
"-because I think to myself, ""Well, if someday, I am diagnosed with diabetes, I'd just carry on and-"""
Carrying on.
"""-sitting in the corner of the boozer, and chat, and talk and probably get fat."" I don't know, and make it worse. And, yeah, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe."
"So it's been a bit of a-a bit of a shock, but now you kinda reflect on it."
"Yeah, that's gnarly."
Maybe this is the-
That's really gnarly.
"-bit of a shake that I needed, you know, just sort of remind me. I might feel okay. I might-- From my perspective, your perspective, you're thinking, ""Well, what's the problem? Everything's hunky-dory."""
Mm.
"But now you seem to be thinking looking and thinking, ""Maybe thangs weren't, or aren't, as canny as I thought they were."""
"Yeah, I mean, I think you're quite right. I think you just—"
Thangs could be better?
"I don't know, you become sedentary, don't you? No, it seems that-- No, actually, this is quite exciting. It quite [unintelligible 00:31:28]"
"Yeah, I sense that. I sense that in you that you're--"
"I think to myself, I think, ""Oh,"" I think go—"
Quite invigorated with the baldy notion of--
"Yeah. I mean, this is- this is- this is gnarly, it's like an old challenge again."
Making some of these changes. Yeah.
"This is gradeley. And, um—"
You're up for the challenge?
"I think I am. I mean, I never thought about it, but when I think about it now it's, ""What am I doing here?"" Why am I like this? Why am I just chuffed contented to drift?"
So think about when you were-- This-this is an interesting question to see what you think. You were- you were a coach. You-- Maybe you'll be a coach again.
Yeah.
"What would you say if you were talking to yourself, if you like, you know, if you were the coach saying, ""Right--"""
"Oh, so if I was obs- if I was sort of-"
"Yeah, what-what would you be saying?"
-observing as it were?
Yeah.
"Watching myself, what would I say? I-I-- Well, I would say, you know, are you chuffed?"
Yeah.
That-- Are you contented with that performance of you and your team?
"And, I suppose, our own personalized a ickle bit like that, there's lots of different aspects that need to be tweaked."
Yeah.
"Modified and looked at, to get the best out of ourselves, to get the best out of the opportunities we have."
"I think you're- I think you're right. I think, um-- And again, you put them together and it's-it's-it's becoming-- It's-it's a sort of a-an individual team job, isn't it really?"
"Yeah, yeah."
"That, okay, do a bit of this and do a bit of that."
"Some gradeley thangs I'm- some thangs I'm waxa at and there are some other aspects we think, ""Well--"""
"Yeah, but I don't have to give up anything really, do I?"
It's not about giving up your personality or-
No.
-changing who you are fundamentally.
No it's not. It's not.
"It's just tweaking thangs. Just fine-tuning a few endz and being a bit more aw-aware of one aspect of your life a bit more, like the nom nom choices or whatever. Well, Mike, I-I've really enjoyed listening to your perspective, and your jackanory a ickle bit, and it's helped me a lot to get an baldy notion about where you're coming from, and a ickle bit about who you are, and what's happened in your past. And-and we've also talked a bit about what's going to happen next. And you've come up with some nang baldy notions. What I hear you saying is that, you know, before all this, before you met the GP, thangs are going cushty.Well, as you would of-- As, you know, as you'd seen it, you were just doing your thang, and getting on working, and being chocker, and being successful, and then suddenly this diagnosis, this quack tells you that you've got a problem."
Mm-hmm.
"It comes along to me and talk today a bit about how you felt about that. Initially, it can be quite a bit of a-bit of a shock. It didn't quite fit with how you saw thangs."
"True, true."
"And as we've been talking, I'm hearing you're saying that maybe if you look back to where you were before you went to the quack, thangs weren't quite that right, maybe. Thangs weren't as waxa as you thought they were."
"Now that I think about it- now that I think about it, maybe."
Yeah.
Maybe they were.
"And what I also hear you saying, it's possibly the-- It's now possibly more possible, in your mind, that you could make some of these changes, rather than bring broad-brush, you know, ginormous changes to your lifestyles. It's not about changing who you are, it's not changing ginormous facets of your life, but maybe pint-sized steps that need to be taken."
"Yeah, you see—"
What you're kind of thinking about what those might.
Mm. When your life comes to a halt-
Mm.
"-your fam splits up, or whatever, and you don't have anymore, I-I think you stop caring really. Uh, y-you know, you stop caring about yourself"
Yeah.
Because everything is just f-
Nobody there too.
"Nobody there, [crosstalk] it's true and so,-"
Yeah.
"-you know,-"
Mhm.
-you don't care.
So now it's time-
So that's maybe [crosstalk]
-to think about looking after yourself a bit more.
"Maybe, a bit selfish but maybe why not?"
Why not?
"Why not? Yeah, that's a gradeley baldy notion."
"Yeah. So, we've run out of time but I also want to ask you a final question, where to from here, what's next?"
"Oh right, well, wha-what we talked about. Now, you know, uh, okay, uh, coffee. Right? No sugar."
You'll start with that?
I'll start with that.
Yeah.
"Um, I'm gonna, um, I'll be talking to Bill, uh-"
The gym.
-about the gym but-
Yeah.
"-I like the baldy notion of, actually again doing squash-"
Yeah.
-or something else-
Yeah.
-and I'm gonna go down to the rugby club and I'll- I know that will be accepted. I'll offer my services again because-
Yeah.
-it was reasonably successful.
Yeah.
"And, uh—"
And you also mentioned you'll happen go and- back and see the quack and just give him a bit of an update as to-
"No, [crosstalk] oh, well, okay, yeah I didn't- yeah, I'll go back and say-- Well, look, I'd-I'd rather not go back to the quack and say, ""I'm gonna do this, this, this-"
Yeah.
-this and this.
Mhm.
This is between you and me.
Yep.
All right?
It's hunky-dory.
"But this is what I'm gonna do. All right? And like I said, I'm gonna make the inquiries, I will start there-"
Sure.
"-I will give up, uh, I'll give up the V drinks,-"
Mhm.
"-I think, um, look for some better wine. [laughter] Um, and-and I-I'd take an interest really."
You are gonna make a start?
"I'll take an interest really and-and, uh, but it is quite exciting, Mark."
"It is. Well, just to help you, because there's probably a lot of other questions you might have, other questions that might come up after this session."
Yeah.
"-before we go, I'd like to just-just give you a lot of- some griff that might help-help you."
Not too much.
"Not too much, just some stuff that might just give you a ickle bit of background skinny on-"
"Yeah, yeah."
-some of the thangs that have-
"Just give me a bit of background, really."
"-around type- around Type II diabetes and some,-"
"Oh, yeah, and what it is-"
[unintelligible 00:36:53] some of that.
"-because I don't really know. Yeah, yeah."
"Um, and I'd like to us- for us to meet again, so to catch up with you and make an appointment before you leave. Just to see how thangs are going and-"
Okay.
-see what sort of ickle changes you've managed to make. I'd be really [unintelligible 00:37:07]-
"Wha-what are we talking about, sort of few months down the line?"
It's really up to you. Probably a ickle bit sooner would be canny.
"What, in about a month's time?"
That'd be gnarly.
"Yeah, okay, I'm up for that."
How does that sound?
"I'm up for that. Yeah, now-now that's putting me, um, that's very gently putting my chump on the block"
Because you don't know the timeline?
"-and I don't mind that because, um, yeah, that's gnarly."
Mhm.
"Yeah, yeah. I'll see you in a month."
Yeah.
No worries.
"Phat, grand. Thanks, Mike. [croostalk]"
And I appreciate it. Thank you.
"Hi, Mr. Stowe."
Hey.
How are you doing today? I'm Bruce Berger.
Pleasure to meet you.
"I, uh, I'm a case manager with your health plan. I understand that you came in today to talk about your diabetes."
"Yeah. I'm supposed to learn how to manage it. I just learned that I got diabetes and apparently, it's pretty diabolical 'cause, uh, she said my claret sugar was sky high, and then she laid all these ginormous consequences on thangs that can happen. That just sounds so disastrous and, uh, and then she told me I gotta do all this stuff. And bloke, I'm just sort of gutted right now."
"So you just- you just saw the quack and, uh, you know, you sound like you just got blindsided, uh, with, uh, not only how, how hairy this seems that you have diabetes and that, uh, she-- you say she told you a whole lot of thangs that can happen with your mince pies and circulation and all those kinds of thangs."
She mentioned my pins having griefs and-
"And so you're really kind of reeling right now from, uh, all of that. And you sound a ickle bit pretty, pretty scared actually."
"Well, that's, yeah. It's not just being scared, you know. I don't want that to happen to me, but then when I, when-when she reels off all these thangs I gotta do and I'm sort of going oh, oh, you know, I'm not certain I can even get it done. So it's sort of sitting-- well, you know, I'm sitting here thinking that, oh my God, this is- this is what's gonna happen to me."
So it sounds like-
"And it is discouraging, just like discouraging."
"So it sounds a lot like, uh, on top of the fact that you've got something you're really scared about having consequences in terms of everything that can happen, what worries you also is all the different thangs that she told you you're going to need to do to get it under control. Can't imagine doing all those thangs, so you almost feel like all that diabolical stuff's gonna happen."
"Yeah. It looks like a massive task that I'm may not be able to handle. And then, yeah, all this smeggy stuff happens to me. I mean, it's- it's a bleak-looking situation and a lot worse."
"Okay. And I-- And what I want to do is help you kind of break this up into some-some doable chunks so that we can get your claret sugar down. I, you know, on the one spud, your quack is right, you know. Your claret sugar is very high and we do wanna get it down so that we don't have those consequences happen. Uh, and-and there are a number of thangs that you need to do in order to-to get your claret sugar down. Um, you know, on the other spud, we can take this a step at a time, so it's not so overwhelming."
"And I'd like you to be able to tell me what kinds of thangs that you can do right now. You know, for example, there- there's basically three thangs that need to be worked out with diabetes. Taking your medicine as prescribed. And honestly, if I was gonna work on one thang right away, given that everything seems so overwhelming would probably that-that first, because that'll have the biggest impact. How-how does that sound so far?"
"Well, I don't think too much pickle in taking the medicines, especially since I understand my claret sugar is really high. and-"
So that's putzy to do.
"Yeah, I'm pretty- I'm pretty gradeley at taking drugs."
"Yeah. 'Cause it looks like you need to just take your medicine, uh, uh, once a day from-from the prescription. So that sounds doable right now."
Yeah. I think I could probably do that.
"Okay. The other thangs that need to be worked on over time deffo would be changing your eating habits, you know, to eat- eat healthier, uh, not necessarily less, but healthier. And the other thang would be getting, um, some more physical activity. And by the way, that doesn't mean going to a gym. That means thangs like more walking, maybe using apples and pears instead of an elevator or an escalator, stuff like that. Uh."
"Well, she also mentioned monitoring my claret sugar and all this. And that just seemed like a lot of mumbo jambo to me."
Yeah. And that really is to give you feedback about how those other thangs are doing so that it keeps you on task.
"Oh, okay."
"So it helps you know that when you're taking your medicine, when you're changing your eating habits, that it's really having an impact on your claret sugar 'cause getting your claret sugar down is going to keep you from having all of those other problems. How does all this-- where does this leave you now right now in terms of how you're feeling?"
"Well, I like it that I, you know, that-that we can do it at a step at a time. I mean, that's-- that relieves some pressure."
Okay.
"And being able to talk with you and do this as we go along rather than-- I-I wasn't certain I could just, wham, put this ginormous program in[chuckles] into effect. Uh, but doing a step at a time and I, you know, that-- getting on the medicine, I don't think that's any big problem. That I can do I am pretty sure."
It sounds like you're very committed to that.
"Yeah. I think I could do that. Uh, as long as there's no big-time side effects, but, uh-"
"Well, Mr. Smith, that's your medication sorted out."
Good.
Claret pressure's a ickle on the high side.
Yeah.
Okay. I wonder if I could raise the subject of your weight.
What?
I wondered if we could spend just a couple of minutes talking about your weight.
"You are joking, aren't you? I mean, look, I've made time in my day to come here."
Yeah.
I'm kept in your waiting room-
Yeah.
-for 45 minutes.
Yeah.
It's not acceptable.
Yeah.
You know?
Yeah.
If I make an appointment with a client for 10:00-
Yeah.
"-I expect them to start at 10:00, not 10:45."
"Right, and you-- so you're chock-a-block nuff, and—"
"Yeah, I've got other thangs to do. I've got accounts to do."
Yeah.
I've got clients they're coming in.
"Yeah, yeah."
You know?
"And it wasn't essentially putzy for you to make the time to come down, and you had to wait in the waiting pad, and now I raised the subject of weight just when you're thinking of going."
"Yeah, I mean, okay, fair nuff, um, I've got to have my claret pressure-"
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"-medication changed, but I really haven't got time to talk about my weight. I mean, you know, I'm aware of my weight."
Right.
"I'm aware of the problems, and I'm also aware of the solutions."
Right.
"Um, so I don't really need a palaver, it's- it's just I've got too much to do at the mo, you know?"
Right. And so it-it-it's been a bit of a rush for you coming in.
Yeah.
"And, I- I'm sorry about the wait in the waiting pad."
"Well, it's b- it's diabolical form, you know?"
"Yeah, yeah, that's, um, and that- that's not putzy for you, because you- you'd like to go really soon, and here I am asking you to spend just a couple of minutes with me."
"Yeah, but basically I've got thangs to do."
Yeah.
I gotta get back to the office.
Yeah.
I've got a pile of work-
Yeah.
-that I've gotta deal with.
Yeah.
And every time- every mo out of my day-
Yeah.
-means that I have to work in the evening-
Yeah.
-or the weekends.
Yeah. It counts.
"Well, when you're self-employed, you haven't got a choice, you know?"
"Yeah, exactly. Exactly. It's up to you, just a couple of minutes."
"Well, I'm here now, so yeah, okay, if it's a couple of minutes, yeah?"
I promise.
"Okay, because I really must get on."
I want- I wanted to simply ask you how you feel about it?
"About what-what, losing weight? Well, obvs, I-I want to."
Yep.
"Um, yeah, I mean, who doesn't? I mean, I'm aware that I'm over my, uh, uh, b-b-b-balance weight, but I now know that it's causing problems. I mean, obvs, I get out of breath if I have to do something a bit howering, and I realize that I'm on this claret pressure-"
Right.
"-um, and-and maybe that's probably contributing to it."
"Right. So you can see the links between your weight and your health, and you'd like thangs to be a bit better."
"Yeah, I mean, there are rather other thangs, but I mean, yeah, the weight is a- is a- is a- something I would like to get hold off. You get on [inaudible 00:03:17]"
"You'd like to, if you could?"
"Yeah, I mean, I know, um, th- the theories of bit of exercise on a regular basis, um, a balanced diet. Um, but unfortunately, because of my lifestyle, because of being self-employed as an accountant, it's finding the time, uh, to exercise, but also, finding the time to sort of think, ""Okay, I'm gonna go shopping for this, that, and the other""-"
Yeah.
"-""I'm gonna prepare a nose-bag."""
Yeah.
"With me, it's very often—"
"Ready nose-bags, and that sort of thang."
"Yeah, yeah. Nose-bag on the run, you know?"
"Okay, yeah."
Grazing.
"Let me see if I can summarize what you've said, um, and then we'll see what next. Um, you lead a chock-a-block life."
Yeah.
"Um, you run a business, and you've got a lot to do."
Yeah.
"Yeah. Um, you're- you're- you're aware of the- of the links between your health and your weight, and you are stuffed, to some extent, about that, and ideally it sounds like you'd like to do something about it, it's just that your life is chock-a-block and rushed, and you tend to use convenience noms noms in order to get the work done."
"Yeah, I mean, I, to a certain extent, because of my lifestyle, nose-bag is just fuel."
"Yeah, yeah."
"You know? Um, because I'm juggling all these balls, and I don't want to drop any."
"I get it. I get it. And so, if you could fit it in, you would like thangs to be different, but that's not so putzy."
No.
Okay. Can I suggest that you come back and see me in a couple of weeks time just to chat about this?
"Um, okay, I'm up for that, but it's gonna be the same problem of, A, finding time-"
Right.
"-and B, if I can make an appointment-"
"Right, right."
-I don't expect to be kept waiting for half an hour-
Exactly.
"-or whatever, 'cause it's—"
"Exactly. I'll tell you what might be a canny solution, is if you come down first appointment, and I give you an appointment at 8:30-"
That'd be gradeley.
"- and then there'll be absobloodylutely no waiting. And, the purpose of that- of that visit will be to have a squiz at how you really feel about how you could move forward, and somehow fit in a more healthier lifestyle into the chocker work life that you've got."
"I'll maybe have a shufty at my schedule, see whether anything-"
Yeah.
"-can be arranged, or I can pass something on-"
Yeah.
"-to something on to some-- and-and so it's not a wasted interview. So I can come here and say, okay, I've looked at my schedules, I've looked at things-"
Good.
-whatever.
"Gradeley. And see if you can fix it up, and also give some thought to what we've talked about."
"Yeah, of course."
Gradeley stuff. Okay.
"Okay, thanks. Sorry, I went off a bit."
"Well, I'm glad we figured that out and I think you'll feel better over the next few days."
"Oh, thanks so much quack. I'll just take it putzy for a couple of days."
"Well, since I have you here and we still have a few minutes left, I'd like to bring up another topic. I noticed that your claret pressure and your weight have been climbing a bit over the past few years. We haven't really had time to talk about this much before and I may be able to offer some useful strategies. Would it be okay if we discussed weight and health for a few minutes?"
"Yeah, I suppose. I know my weight is a problem, but every time I try to take it off, I end up gaining it back. I don't know what to do."
I know how you feel. Managing weight can be frustrating. Maybe we can just start trying to figure it out together and I'll be here to help you through the challenges.
"Okay, thank you quack, but I'm just stuffed about how I can possibly lose weight now since work is so chocker and the kids take up so much of my time."
"Yeah, that's deffo understandable. We both know that there's a lot that plays into weight management, but there's no need to figure it all out today, especially since thangs are so chocker for you right now. Maybe we could put our loaves together and think about something tiddly that fits reasonably into your life and then we can take further steps when you're ready."
"Okay, that sounds gnarly. So, what should I do?"
"Well, let's see. One of the thangs that's involved in managing weight and health is being active. Physical activity benefits the whole body. It's healthy for our joints, our stress levels, and especially for weight management. Happen we could talk about some ways of adding activity that fit into your life."
"I knew you were gonna say that, but I don't have time in my schedule. I can't afford to take an hour to go to the gym every day."
"Well, I understand that. I don't have an hour to go to the gym every day either, but one of the gnarly thangs about physical activity is that any amount in any type of activity can be very helpful. For example, let's think about some activities that you enjoy doing."
I like to walk.
Me too. Walking is gnarly exercise.
"Wait a minute, isn't walking too mild to help you lose weight, though?"
"Actually, even just a few minutes of walking is really healthy and worthwhile, and then when you have time to do even more, that's gnarly. Walking is also coolio because you can do it anywhere, it doesn't need to be at the gym."
"Oh, wow, that sounds gradeley. You know what? Come to think of it, I have some time before I have to go back to work and I saw a canny park on the way over here, maybe I can take a short dander after this appointment."
That sounds gnarly.
"And you know what? I used to really love to dance, but I haven't done that in such a long time."
"Well, dancing is a gnarly exercise, especially because it's fun."
Hmm. And I know my fam would support me if I could just find some place where I can go dancing.
"Oh, that's gnarly to hear that your fam is so supportive. And I bet there's a dance class somewhere around where you live or maybe even a dance fitness class at the gym."
"Yeah, and you know what? I really like to try that."
Would you like to do some research on this and give it a shot?
"Actually, I really would. I'm kind of stoked about it. What else you got?"
"Well, piddly steps can go a long way. So, even thangs like taking the dancers instead of the elevator every once in a while or parking just a bit further from the door when you go to a store can be ways to increase movement in your day."
Mm-hmm. I can do that.
How about we start there and let's plan to follow up in a few weeks so we can see how it's going and then maybe talk about some other strategies that might help.
"Diet, the D word."
"Not necessarily. What we eat is deffo important for weight and health, but just like we did today, we can talk about some diddy steps that can fit into your life, and especially ones that you feel mustard about."
"Yeah, I like that. Okay, I'll make an appointment and I'll start dancing right away, doc."
That's gnarly. I'll see you soon
". So, um, tell me about the exercise."
"Well, um, since we spoke last, I've been to the gym a couple of times."
You have?
I have.
That's mega.
"Yeah, and actually, my pants feel a ickle better too. I'm very chuffed with it."
"So, what else have you noticed other than your-your pants are fitting better?"
"Um, I do feel better."
Mm-hmm.
My back—
Your-- my what?
"Well, my back doesn't hurt nearly so much."
Wow.
"And, um, but it seems like it's, um-- but it's still hard. I'd like to go more often or I-I guess that I'm-- I just need to be a ickle more patient with myself because it's, um, I'm not, uh, I'm not-- I wanna be able to like spend more time at the gym but right now, it's um, not, um-- Well, I guess I need to build up to it."
Mm-hmm. So and what would you-- What would- What would help you get to building up to it? Spending more time there.
"Um, well, I guess just sticking with it and not getting, um, sidetracked."
Mm-hmm.
"Like last week, I-I didn't get there at all until like Thursday during the week,-"
Mm-hmm.
-so it was- it was a frustrating week like for the gym that way.
Mm-hmm.
"I was kinda chock-a-block with some other thangs, but, um—"
Mm-hmm. But you made it-- You made it one day-
I-I got—
-instead of zero days.
"Yeah, and actually, I made it again on Saturday too. So."
That's mega.
Yeah.
"Even with this, you know, pretty horrendous schedule going on."
"Yeah. It's been a ickle-ickle hectic, you know. And, uh-- But, I-I don't like it too much because there's all these younger guys that can lift a lot more weight than me or they can stay on the treadmill longer and it-it-it's a ickle discouraging, you know. 'Cause I don't know if you've noticed, I'm not buff and they are. And it's-it's a ickle discouraging to think how much work it's gonna take to get, you know, kinda back towards that."
So you-you'd like to get buffed?
"No, but, um, when-when I'm not at the gym, and I am my bog-standard rational self, I realize that I'm, you know, way, way past the age of where I would really even want to do that, let alone want to spend the time it takes. But then while I'm at the gym, and I see the buff young guys, you know, lifting a lot of weight and all that stuff, then you know, the-- I don't know, the urge to be buff comes up in me."
"So, but for right now, it sounds like the-- just having the pants fit better-"
Yeah.
"-sounds really, you know, like it's making you feel gradeley about yourself and—"
It is.
What other positive thangs have you noticed about the exercise?
"Well, I noticed-- Well, I-I still need to work on my diet a lot. I haven't-- I-I'd like to say that by working out at the gym, I have, uh, I've -I've modified my diet, but I haven't very much. I've gotten a ickle bit better with that, but I'd like to do a lot more."
In what way have you gotten a ickle bit better?
"Um, a ickle bit less tat nom nom. Um, like at times, when I'm like I feel like, ""Oh, I think I'll just go have a ket all time loser,"" or some duff thang like that I'll actually have second thoughts before I do it."
"So you're at the second thought part. And what do you think would-- might take you, uh, over to actually doing it if you wanted to?"
"Well, I think, uh, when I really start seeing some results at the gym, it's kinda, uh, I think the way it works in my mind is if I've worked out really hard and I've- and I've-- say I've lost a pound that week-"
Mm-hmm.
"-you know, and then as I'm looking at that double or triple fudge four-decker of ice cream Sunday thang, you know, that somebody is eating, I would say, ""Wow, that would be about two hours on the treadmill."" Then-then that would be probably-- the-- that would keep me from actually ordering one of those."
"Oh, okay. The payoff just wouldn't be worth that two hours of treadmill versus that double fudgy browny thingy."
"Right, decadent-- Why do they put the word decadent in nose-bag?"
"'Cause it is decadent, it's lovely."
Okay.
"Yeah, yummy, so-"
"Okay. But it seems to be going so far so gradeley. I-I guess, you know, I can like, you know, um, I-I'm-I'm pretty chuffed with who-- how it's going on. Um, I'm really-- I'm glad we talked that last time 'cause it-it was the impetus to get me to go the first time in a long, long time."
"So, Liz, what's something that you'd like to change or maybe that you're feeling two ways about right now?"
"Um, I really want to start working out again. Totes wanna get back in it, have a routine, and just be healthy."
"Okay, and-and why would you want to make this change?"
"Um, I'm moby of feeling the way I do. I feel kinda sluggish. Especially with the winter coming, I think I want to have more energy."
Mm-hmm.
"Um, I don't like the way my clothes fit or don't fit me."
Mm-hmm.
"Just, I don't feel comfortable."
"Yeah. So, you're not feeling comfortable with the way that, you said, your clothes fit."
Mm-hmm.
"What are some of the reasons why, um, it would be gradeley for you to kinda make this change?"
"Um, I know exercise is-- in the past, has always made me feel gradeley. I felt canny about myself, and just in general, exercise, I know, makes me feel mustard. I want to be a waxa example for my kids. I want them to feel like that's a part of life-"
Mm-hmm.
"-exercising. So, I want-- I really just want to go get back in a routine."
"So, to heal-- feel healthy for yourself as well be a gradeley role model for your kids?"
Yeah.
"So, if you did decide to get exercising more into your daily routine, how would you go about doing it?"
"Um, I don't know. I'd probably have to sit down maybe with my husband and try to figure out a gradeley time for me to be able to do that, where he'd be home with the kids and I'd be going to do that, whether it's morning-time, evening, maybe the weekends."
Mm-hmm.
"Just to find the time to be able to do it, or what works in our schedule."
"So, it's that balance of doing something for yourself, but it sounds like you don't want that schedule to affect too much into your fam routine."
"Right, yeah."
"So, on a scale from 1 to 10, 1 being not important and 10 being very important, where would you rate yourself on how important it is to start exercising more?"
"Mm, I would like to say a seven or an eight, that that's how important it is to me."
"Okay, and how come not at like a five or a six?"
Because I'm really moby of being overweight.
Mm-hmm.
"Not ha-- I just don't like being unhealthy. It doesn't make me feel gradeley, so I'm motivated to change, it's just getting there."
"So, to summarize, it's important for you to do this. You're starting to feel sluggish, you're not feeling healthy, and you know that you've got other peeps in your fam watching you, and you want to be a mustard role model for them to know that this is gonna be just a part of your life, is your exercise. Yet for you, you're struggling just a ickle with the logistics of when to schedule time for you so it doesn't interfere too much with your fam."
"Exactly, yeah."
"So, knowing this, what do you think you'll do next?"
"Mm, I'll probably, I don't know, find-- Now, while it's still somewhat okay outside, maybe pick days I'm gonna go for danders or runs, um, maybe look for a gym close to the drum so that I know I can go there sharpish or maybe that has daycare, um, yeah, maybe I'll just start to look for that, and find ways I can do it first."
That's gnarly. It sounds like you've got some options and leads on how- on how to get that done.
Yeah.
"I don't know, I'm just having a lot of hard pickle trying to lose the rest of the weight. Um, right now, it's like no matter how much I try to exercise, run, or whatever, it doesn't matter like chuff-all else is coming off."
"Right, so you've hit a plateau in your weight and despite all the thangs that you're trying to do to increase your activity, it doesn't seem to be working on the scale?"
"No, and I don't know what I'm doing wrong because I keep trying the exercise but chuff-all's happening."
"Right. So you feel like you're spinning your wheels, you're doing more exercising and it's not showing results on the scale?"
Yes.
And you're not feeling so gradeley about that?
"No, and even when I'm coming home, like, I'll go to the gym and then I'm noticing chuff-all is happening and I'll come home and I try to talk to my mama about it or even my old man, and no one even cares about it. Like no one wants to support in it any road."
"Uh, so you feel like you're doing this all alone?"
Yes.
At pad or you think that they'll be supportive but they're not giving- they're not giving you what you need?
"No, and specifically my old man, he just-- Not only does he not want to support me with it but at the same time, he feels like I need to be gaining my weight back."
"Oh, okay."
So I—
Tell me about that.
"It's as though by me losing weight, it's like I'm somehow disconnecting from my fam, and he thinks that I'm trying to form myself to fit into like this champion American picture and I just want to be healthy, I just want to have a mustard body and he doesn't think of it that way."
"Hi, Natalie. I'm Dawn."
"Hi, Dawn. Canny to meet you."
"Canny to meet you, too. Thanks for coming in today."
Thanks for having me.
Yeah. Tell me a ickle bit about yourself.
"So I am, um, 28. And I moved out to Arizona about six months ago. Um, I really enjoy spending time with my fam and hanging out with chums whenever I can. Work keeps me pretty chocker. Um, But I'm really, um, looking to kind of make some changes to my diet and physical activity. I'm not really chuffed to buggery with where my weight's at right now, and, uh, so I thought it'd be ream to come and talk with you about some of that stuff."
"Yeah, you're feeling a ickle bit dissatisfied with your health patterns?"
"Yeah. Um, I'm really starting to notice how I feel more sluggish and just not-- My mood is shifted a lot too, which at first, I thought was because it's getting colder outside, um, but I do also think it maybe has some relation to my activity, or lack thereof, and also kind of the nose-bags that I'm eating."
"Okay, so you're feeling some low energy and you know, in the past, when you've been more active and eating differently, you've had more energy?"
Right. Yeah. Especially during times when I'm more active is when I noticed the biggest cha-change in energy and mood.
"Yeah. Tell me more about that, those previous times that you've been active."
"Yeah. Um, well, I played sports in college, so that kept me pretty chock-a-block, and that was really fun, um, and I just think back now to, as much that I would cram into a 24 -hour period, and like, wonder how I did that, but I think that part of it was because I was so active physically, um, I just had way more energy throughout the day, mentally and physically to, um, you know, go to school full-time and-and still socialize with chums and do all that stuff. Um, so when I think back to like, probably like the peak of my life of when I felt my best physically, mentally it was that time."
"You had energy, and you were like the Energizer Bunny, just keep going and going and going."
"Yeah, yeah, exactly. And now it's not so much the same. Um, like when I get home from work, I'm pretty slaughtered, uh, it takes a lot for me to want to be physically active when I've spent all day staring at a pooter and thinking and working. And so, um, yeah, that's probably been my biggest, uh, issue is like when work ends, going home and not really doing anything. Um, just trying to like unwind by watching Netflix or something else, right?"
"So your days are just as full now that you're working and a career bod, um, and your energy level isn't what it used to be. What-- Do you have any baldy notions about why that might have shifted?"
"Um, well, I think part of it is that when I was in college, it wasn't really an option to go, like, I had to go to practice or I had to do those thangs because that was, in a sense, my job that was paying for school, um, and now there's not that same commitment to other peeps or to scholarship wedge. So that totes has shifted, um, but I-I do feel like a-an urgency to go it just doesn't seem that like the step that's missing is for me to actually go to a gym or somewhere to be more active. Like, I think I want to it's just the doing it that seems to not happen."
"Right. So in the past, it wasn't up to you whether you had the choice to go be physically active. Now it is up to you, and-and you're looking back at the last few years and saying, I wanna do thangs differently."
Mm-hmm.
I want to be more physically active than I've been.
"Yeah, yeah, I think so. Um, that's not to say like, I wanna go run a marathon but I do think that it would help me a lot in terms of just having a better outlook on life, um, and better energy to- if I were to pick up some type of activity."
Gnarly. And you've noticed a mood enhancement effect of exercise.
Mm-hmm.
Tell me more about that. What do you notice specifically about your mood on the days you're physically active?
"Just, I'm-I'm just happier and more upbeat and I think that even my outlook is more positive. So like, if I'm sitting in traffic, and I haven't been physically active, I'll probably grumble about it but if I'm sitting in traffic, and I have been, it's like, I just have a different outlook on thangs and I already feel like I've gotten something accomplished that day. So it just kind of like helps with that ripple effect into my day of like getting more thangs done."
"Yeah, you feel more accomplished and-and you feel less salty by the diddy stuff."
"Mm-hmm. Yeah, exactly."
"Gnarly. Well, let me see if I've got this all. You came to Arizona six months ago, you're trying to figure out new rhythms and patterns for yourself. You're looking back at the past few years, and in college, you were real active because you were an athlete, and now it's more up to you about making that choice of physical activity, and you're discovering that, um, not being active has affected your energy level and your mood, and that's something you're looking for more of, both of those thangs, energy and-and a mood booster."
"Yeah. And then also to, um, like I mentioned, I'm not totes chuffed with my weight, um, and so hoping too that that would have some impact there and-and maybe help me, um, if my activity kind of gets resolved or improves, then my nutrition also, maybe would go along with it and get better."
Yeah. Tell me more about your weight concerns. When did you start feeling dissatisfied with your body?
"Uh, probably about three, four months ago. Um, yeah, just my clothes started fitting tighter, which wasn't as comfortable, and, um, yeah, just not really super chuffed with my appearance, which has never really been an issue, um, in my life up until now. I've usually been pretty okay with that, and then in the last three months, I just feel, um, like I've had a lot more of a negative outlook on it."
"Mm-hmm. Okay, so it sounds like a sort of a vicious cycle and-and maybe the lacking physical activity has made you feel less confident in yourself. I wonder if that's also a piece of this puzzle since you mentioned that's been a big difference from what was happening in the past."
"Yeah, I think- I think the activity piece and then also to like, the nose-bags that I'm eating, I don't think are that coolio. So that also kind of does the same thang, I think, to my appearance or the way that I viewed myself."
"Okay. So you had a pretty strong self-confidence, pretty strong body image all the way up until a few months ago and, um, you're hoping to kind of get back to that place where you feel gradeley about yourself."
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Gnarly.
"Well see, my-my trouble and strife's been getting on me a lot lately about trying to improve my health habits, and I really don't see what the big problem is. I mean, I've been working real hard. Sometimes I can't come home for din-dins, so I'm having to go out to eat at Applebee's or something like that, so-- but she seems to have a bigger problem, I really don't see what the big deal is."
"Okay, and so what I'm hearing is that you don't feel like your health is concerning you right now, or anything like that?"
I-I-I feel hunky-dory.
Okay.
"I mean, my-my work is really chap-manual labor-intensive so I'm usually working out in-in the hot currant bun the majority of the day, so I'm usually sweating out any like diabolical thangs I put in my system, so—"
"Okay. Have you noticed putting on any weight, or anything like--?"
"Well, a ickle bit, but chuff-all too-- you know. I'm not blo- I'm not bloated or anything."
Okay. Okay. And how about going to see the quack? Have you gone to-- for a visit or anything recently?
"Well, yeah, I've been to the quack about maybe last year for a physical, but-- I mean, everything showed up to be cushty, so—"
Okay. But you feel that you feel gradeley?
Yeah.
"Okay. Um, and so what I hear is that you're-- you feel like your trouble and strife might be, uh, overreacting to this?"
"Well, I mean, not really overreacting. I know that she loves me and I know she-she wants me, uh, you know, live a long time and be healthy, but just sometimes, especially if you work a hard job, like kinda going out to eat at these places kinda makes you feel a ickle bit better about your situation."
"Sure. Sure. Okay. Um, and so one thang I'd just like to do is maybe give you some skinny on, um, maybe obesity or diabetes if you're interested or open to that. If you're, you know--?"
Sure. [unintelligible 00:01:33]
Okay. Good.
"So, again, I hear your overall goal is really, to not give up these thangs you'd like but to cut back on how much you have-"
"Yeah, I guess so."
"-on that. All right. So, I'd like to ask you, uh, kind of a scaling question about this 'cause I'm hearing that this feels really important to you that you'd be way up there on the high- on the high end of importance."
Yeah.
"So, I'm gonna ask the question this way, on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is not at all confident, and 10 is like, ""I'm very, very confident,"" where would you put yourself on a scale right now of confidence in starting this new plan?"
"Right now, I'm probably-"
Mm-hmm.
-gonna say a six.
A six.
"But I know when I go home and I see the nose-bag, it's probably gonna drop back down to a four."
"Okay. All right. So, let's talk about that, um, so we should just assume we're gonna be at a four."
Right?
Okay?
I guess.
"So, why are you at a four and not even a lower number? Why are you not like a zero or a one?"
"Because I've been wanting to do this for-for years, like-"
Okay.
-ever since I started becoming conscious of my body.
Okay.
"Like ever since I started being a teen, like this has always been a goal of mine, like, especially 'cause all my charvers play togger, and like-"
Uh-huh.
"-hike, and are like super stick-thin but really healthy and active."
Okay.
"And so I'm just sort of like, well, I'm not."
Okay.
"But I want to be like-- I don't want to be like stick-thin, but I really want to be like really healthy and really active."
Okay.
"And like be able to look canny, you know."
"Okay, all right."
I wanna be able to look canny.
"Okay. So, what would help increase that confidence? What-- Because that sounds like where we really need to focus on. What's gonna help you feel more confident about this?"
I don't even really know-
Mm-hmm.
"-honestly. Like, I mean, I know I'm gonna have to keep like telling myself like-"
Mm-hmm.
-like this is something that you want- that you've wanted-
Uh-huh.
-for years.
Uh-huh.
"Like, you can do it. Because like-"
Okay.
I know I can do it. Like I can do anything.
All right.
I can do anything-
All right.
-I know that. But it's hard getting to the point where I-
Okay.
-do something.
"All right. Well, if it's okay, just for a mo, let's put the- let's put the changing the eating pattern off to the side, and let's take a squiz at some other time in your life that there was something you really wanted to accomplish and you did. And what is it about you- what was it about you? What kind of strengths did you bring to the table that allowed you to tackle something that felt like a challenge and-and allowed you to be successful?"
"Hi, Liz. Well, thanks for meeting with me today."
Sure.
"So what's something that you'd like to change or, um, work towards?"
"Well, [sighs] I've been thinking about working out lately. I really want to start working out again. It's-it's been in my mind, I know I need to do it. It's just getting the motivation to do it."
And you've been talking about that a lot lately. So I really-
Mm-hmm.
"-feel like this is something that you need to do soon because, um, a lot of times, you're just a lot of talk. And then, there's no action. And if you really wanna see results, I think it's something that needs to be done. And, you know, stop being lazy about it and just do it."
"Well, I don't know if I'm really being lazy about it. I think it's just that I have a chock-a-block schedule."
Yeah.
"I just need to find the time to do it. And, yes, I might be lacking a ickle bit of motivation, but I think it's more timing and trying to fit it in."
"And that sounds like a lot of cop-outs to me. So I feel like you had shared with me before that you do have a gym membership. So I think that's something that you just need to fit in your schedule. So for you to really see results that you want, my guess is you need to go about three to four times a week and really fit in that hour workout, um, on a daily basis."
"But I think that part of the problem is that I-I don't have three to four times- three to four times a week to do it, or an hour even. I mean, hour is a long time because if I'm working out for an hour that means I'm leaving home to get there-"
Mm-hmm.
"-time there, time back. I mean, it's not just an hour, it's like two hours, realistically."
"And it seems like if you really want to see the results you have to put the time in. And if it's gonna take you two hours, then it's gonna take you two hours. And, again, if you want the results that you want, you need to start, and you need to start now."
"Well, oh, um, okay."
"All right. Well, um, I look forward to talking to you tomorrow. And I'm hoping that you're gonna be able to tell me that you went to the gym."
Okay.
Thanks.
"Hi, Mrs. Smith. I'm Denise. I'm the social worker here at the clinic work that's working with Dr. Fields and the rest of the team. And, um, I know you were here to see Dr. Fields today, and I-I just wanted to let you know, I usually work with peeps who are similar to- have situations similar to you, and that have gone back home from rehab. And, uh, so I'd like to find out a ickle bit if you would, if that's okay, about how it's been going since you got home."
Pretty gradeley.
Yeah?
"Yeah. Um, I'm glad to be there."
Yeah. What are you really glad about?
"Uh, well, I'm glad to see my dog, he's very dinky, and it just feels canny to be home."
Yeah.
"Yeah. And my garden is coming along, and my neighbors have stuff-- It's-it's gradeley. It's canny to be home."
"I know, I-I understand that it was really-- That was your goal. That was a really important thang for you to be able to get home and it sounds like you've been able to really en- enjoy parts of it, and I know you've been going to the- both the physical therapy and the Tai Chi and how's-how's that going?"
"Well, um. I-I didn't get- go to physical therapy this week, and the- or Tai Chi, actually."
"So, I'm wondering if something happened that that led you not to go. You look a ickle, um, down."
"Yeah. Well, um. Actually, I-I had a ickle semi fall, I didn't fall down, I didn't fall down totes but I-I did-- I guess I still had the wobblies and I was hoping that the physical therapy and the Tai Chi would be- get me further along than it has, and I-I still don't have the balance. So, I'm thinking that maybe I was pushing too hard, that maybe I should cut back, you know, and kind of not try so hard to-to keep moving like that."
Mm. So you've been working really hard-
Yeah.
"-through this whole thang, you worked really hard to get home."
Yes.
And you- you've continued to work really hard with both the physical therapy and the Tai Chi and taking care of your drum and doing all those thangs.
Yeah.
"And you had this fall or semi-fall, and you're feeling like maybe- maybe you were pushing too hard?"
"Yeah, yeah."
Yeah.
"So I'm-I'm-I cut back, and I-I don't know if I should really even continue the Tai Chi because it's-it's very demanding."
"Yeah, yeah. It's a lot of work."
"Uh, it's beautiful and-and- but, um, yeah."
What are you stuffed about?
That I'll- that I'll fall again.
Mm-hmm.
"I'll really fall and hurt myself, and this way, if I don't move around so much, there's less chance that I will."
"Yeah, yeah, yeah. And- so you don't want to hurt yourself."
No.
And what are- what are your concerns about-- It doesn't sound like you-you feel like you hurt yourself in this fall.
"No, I didn't- it was just more scary, and it was like a-a signal that maybe I'm doing too much."
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
"Yeah. And, what are you concerned will happen if-if you get hurt or if something-"
"Well, yeah, if I- if I lose my balance and fall down, I could- anything, you know, really get hurt, and then-then I wouldn't be able to be home anymore, and that's not what I want. I want to stay home. So I want to do what I have to do to-to-to stay home."
And it feels like the only way that you can really stay safe and not fall is to not do anything to kind of just hunker down.
"Yeah. [laughs] Yes, you've put it very well, hunker down-"
"Yeah, yeah."
"Watch the TV and pet my dog. I-I, you know, not to that extreme, but yeah, I think- I think maybe, um, yeah, I was-was going- pushing too hard."
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
"And I'm not sure about the Tai Chi anymore. I-I think the physical therapy, I can understand that, but I'm not so sure about the Tai Chi."
"Yeah. So the physical therapy is can- you can kind of still see that it's helping you to build your strength, which-"
Yeah.
-might have probably helped you break your fall this time.
"Right, right."
"Um, I'm wondering what you remember about what-what Dr. Fields said about the Tai Chi in relationship to falls. Did she talk with you about that?"
"She did. Sh-- Yeah, that's right, that's right. She said that they did studies and that they found that it was really preventative. I think she's- I forget the-the percentage, but yeah, she was really mad keen and she does it herself."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Yeah. So you're feeling a little betrayed like it didn't-- ""Look, and I did this, I was doing my Tai Chi, and all of a sudden, I- here, look at this, I fall."""
"That's a strong word, isn't it, ""betrayed"". Um, wow. A ickle, but-but I-I know, I know that it's true. I mean, my chum who does Tai Chi, she just- she loves it. Maybe it's just not for me, you know."
Right.
"But, um-"
"So you're just starting to question a ickle bit about whether or not it might be what is useful and, you know, it-it does really come down to what works for you and what-wh-what you decide will help you stay safe. And I'd like to work with you as I know Dr. Fields would, to-to help build a plan that will help you feel as safe as you can in your home-"
Right.
-and to keep you there and to keep you feeling safe.
Yeah.
Wh-what do you think about that?
"Absobloodylutely, that- because I don't- now I'm-I'm feeling-"
Yeah.
"-really a ickle frit that what if- what if I fall down and-and-and nobody comes around and I'm lying there for two days, you know. I may have heard about that."
"Yeah, right."
"So, um, 'cause I am alone."
"Yeah, yeah."
So—
So it really kinda strikes you that you're- that you're there alone and this could happen and--
Yeah.
"What thoughts do you have about that? What have you heard that others have done, or what are- what are- what thoughts do you have?"
"Well, the-- I think that there's some thangs that could be done to-- I know peeps who live in-in residence, they have a cord they can pull, but how do they get to the cord? Um, is there any- anything else that I could do just to communicate if-if-"
"Yeah, yeah."
-if something does happen?
"Yeah, yeah. I know what's worked for a lot of the-the folks that I've worked with is there's like- it's called a lifeline and they can wear it around their gregory and it's hooked up and- so that if you need help, you can push the button."
I think I saw something like that on TV.
Mm-hmm.
Is it- does it really work?
It does really work.
"'Cause you know that they sell so much stuff on TV, it's like you could- [crosstalk]"
Right. Right.
"It's daft as a brush, it's gaga."
"No, it is something that there's a couple of different of, uh, you know, a couple of different products out there, but it-it does- it can really help, uh, and-and it kind of gives- might give you this sense of security that you have at your fingertips."
"Yeah. I guess so, feeling a ickle scared-"
Mm-hmm.
"-you know, about that happening and-"
Yeah.
"So, yeah, it's probably a signal to-to make some-some changes."
Mm-hmm.
"Like I don't wanna go back to the hospital, right? I really don't. Do I have to?"
We- we're gonna work with you to help you stay home as long as you possibly can and be safe.
Yeah.
"So what do you think that will take, um, because you're the one that really knows how you're feeling about in the drum and how you're feeling about your safety. What do you think? The lifeline is a possibility, that's something you can consider."
That I will definitely- I totes wanna do that.
Mm.
I totes wanna do that.
Mm-hmm. What else do you think it would take for you to feel safe?
"Well, I- maybe they-they-- When I first came home, they had somebody come and show me some thangs in-in the drum, but maybe a refresher of that, and they told me that I should exercise and-and, um, I guess I could-- Maybe support, maybe I'm looking for-for maybe a buddy or something, some way that I could be reminded. I'm feeling a ickle, you know, I was moving along and thangs were feeling more positive, it's sort of like two steps forward and-"
"Yeah, yeah."
"-one step back, but now it's to step forward and three steps back. [laughs]"
Mm-hmm.
"So, um, is there, yeah, like a support somehow? My daughter is very gradeley and she calls me, but you know, she-she lives in Seattle, she lives-"
Yeah.
-far away.
Yeah.
So- and I don't wanna impose on my neighbors or my charvers.
So you'd like to have a ickle bit more support-
Mm-hmm.
-and a ickle bit more connection maybe that-
Yeah.
"-that-that, um, that has to happen. Would you like some suggestions about that?"
Yeah.
"Um, so one of the thangs that- that we also have here, we-we have- we can get some case- what they call case management services and that might be someone who comes in and checks with you at drum and helps you figure out some of the thangs that might need to be done like you were talking about, give you a ickle refresher on safety at home-"
Right.
"-and, uh, and-and also might help you organize and connect up with other services that might be out there or do thangs, um, like that. I don't know. What it- how does that sound to you?"
"Yeah, that would be gradeley. Do you think I should try to go back to the Tai Chi?"
"Yes. I was going to say the other thang that I would say- that I would consider because the senior center, and I know you were really active in the senior center before-"
"Yes, gnarly place."
-and I'm wondering if you feel like there's support there. They have a lot of activities going on at the senior center that- and I- and I don't know what was in the Tai Chi included that might be- not only serve the purpose of the exercise but really help with some of that support.
"Yeah. I guess I've kind of gone to the extreme. I tend to do that. [chuckles] Yeah. So, keep moving?"
"Yeah. It sounds so daft as a brush, doesn't it? Like the- it- when it feels like inside, what you're- what I'm hearing from you is that it feels like inside like moving is unsafe."
Yeah.
"And-and yet, we know we can't make champion safety, but we know that the more you move and the more active that you stay, the less likely it is that you're going to fall and the more safe you're going to be."
Really?
Yes.
"Oh, okay."
Can't prevent all of it-
Uh-huh.
-but we can make it less likely.
"Okay. Okay. Okay. I-I'm willing to start again, so to speak."
Mm-hmm.
Yeah. It's scary.
Yeah. Takes a lot. Takes a lot. And you're the only one that'll- that can know what it is you're willing to work through that fear for.
"Well, I'm willing to work through my fears and difficulties to be in my ickle drum with my ickle dog and my ickle garden. I've been there for- since my husband and I got married, and that's where we lived, and I don't want to give it up yet."
"Mm-hmm. And that's a strong enough motivator for you and gives you enough purpose that you're willing to like kind of push through that fear that even though it's there and that, that sense of-"
Yeah.
-concern about being safe.
Yeah. I-
Yeah.
-I-I am. And I feel like I have some help.
"Yeah. Yeah. Well, we can totes talk about it when you come in again like-"
Okay.
"-again, and-and-"
"So, am I being a baby?"
Not at all.
Okay.
Not being a baby. This is a pretty normal- this is-
Really?
"-very bog-standard. Absobloodylutely. It's an absobloodylutely bog-standard thang to feel that, and especially when you've suffered something that you have and suffered to it, the stroke and the trying to get rehabbed and trying to find a way to get back home and going through the wobblies, this is perfectly bog-standard."
Really?
"Yes. And actually, you-you have really demonstrated to me any road, a lot of strength and bottle because you have continued to persevere and work through this and not everybody does. And you have found a way to get home and you seem really committed to staying home. So you-you've got a lot of strength there that you're working with."
Thank you. Thank you.
"And we can work together to make sure that-- And-and Dr. Fields too, I know, is very interested in that. We can work together to do what we can to keep you there."
"Well, and she- she's not going to throw me back into the hospital?"
Not yet.
Not yet? [laughs] Okay. Yeah. I was sort of- I-I was sort of hesitant to tell you-
Mm-hmm.
-about-
Mm-hmm.
"-this, but, um, uh, I'm sort of glad I did. I'm very glad I did."
I'm really glad you did too. I really appreciate it because that's the only way that we can work together-
Yeah.
- to help you feel safer. And I hope you're going away home today feeling safer.
Yeah. So the-the caseworker is gonna be able to come and refresh-
Mm-hmm.
-me?
We'll get you hooked up.
And-and that's-- Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
"I mean, that alone, to know that I have communication that I w- that was my biggest fear that something-"
Mm-hmm.
-would happen and I wouldn't have any-
Mm.
-any way to tell anybody.
"Good. Well, you've got some gradeley plans and we'll go check it out and make sure they happen."
Okay.
All right. Thanks.
"Oh, hello Scott."
Hi.
"Um, we were talking a ickle bit earlier, and you said you wanted to talk about exercising."
I do.
What's going on with that?
"Well, I just can't seem to get back in the gym. I don't wanna-- I-I used to work out quite a bit, and in the last, I dunno, couple of years I've just-- I stopped going. I got chock-a-block, and now I'm out of the habit, and I-I really, I dunno, I feel like I need to get back."
"Well, I mean, I think you just need to maybe sit down and write down a list of reasons why you need to get back to the gym, and then on the other side of the list, put down, you know, um, baldy notions about what's going to help you get there."
Okay. Um. All right. Um—
What gym do you belong to?
"Uh, I belong to the-the Sport Fitness Center."
Okay. And-and how far away is it from your drum?
Just a couple of miles.
"Just a couple of miles. Mm. So you-- you know, you could, like, ride your bike or walk there, and it would be [unintelligible 00:01:12] too."
"If I walked that far, I probably wouldn't even need to go to the gym, right?"
"Well, I don't know about that. Um. That-- you know, it's really important that you get your, um, not just your cardiovascular-- that's a gradeley baldy notion for the cardiovascular, but also, you know, your, um, weightlifting, the [inaudible 00:01:32] [crosstalk]"
[inaudible 00:01:33] training.
"Yeah, yeah."
It-it-it would be important.
"Yeah. So why-why do you want to-- what do you wanna do with that? You want to look different, or--?"
"Well, I-I-I-I would feel better. My-- I'd-I'd be able to wear more my clothes. I've been growing around the middle and I'd like to, uh, you know, go back to where I was, you know, get into a 34, 36 waist, you know."
Okay.
I-I'm more comfortable-- I feel better. I think that's the main thang.
"Okay. Yeah, because your-your health really, to me, it's more important than your-your shufties. I mean, don't get me pete tong, I understand what you're saying, but, you know, it'd be coolio to get back in those steve mcqueens, but—"
"Yeah, yeah. It-it-it-- I-I am- I'm not getting any younger than I [unintelligible 00:02:18]"
"Mm-hmm. Well, I think you know what to do. You've done it before."
Yeah.
Yeah. Just a matter-- You just gotta do it.
I've gotta make time.
Yeah.
I've gotta make time.
"Yeah. And so that might mean, you know, like giving up an hour's kip, getting up an hour earlier in the day, and going there and getting it done then. That's what I do."
Yeah. Okay.
Yeah.
All right.
"So when I see you next time, you know, that's what I'd like you to do is to, uh, experiment with getting up an hour earlier and, um-- You know, 'cause, uh, getting healthier is more important than kip, you know. I mean, I know kip is important, but-- And then bring that list back that we talked about."
Okay.
Okay?
Okay.
"All right, so I'll see you next week."
Okay. Very gradeley. Thanks.
All right. All right. Bye.
Thanks for coming in. Tell me what's been happening since we last spoke.
"Well, I, um, I did get an interview for a job. Um—"
"Wow, that's so gnarly."
"Yeah, but I wasn't able to go, um, cause my kids, I didn't have any one to watch them. And, um, you know, so the- that was sort of game over. I just, I had to cancel the interview and this, it's too diabolical because it was a really, a- actually was a job that would have been canny, but I don't know."
You sound gutted.
"Well, yeah, because it's- it's, you know, I didn't really have a choice. I guess I have to be- I have to make sure my kids are taken care of first. And, um, you know, I'm worried that this is gonna keep happening."
It's gonna keep happening that you have to turn down opportunities.
Yeah.
"Mm-hmm, okay. Well, tell me, um, on a scale from one to 10, how important is it for you to get a job?"
"Um, it sits about at a 10 because yeah, I mean, I'm the only one supporting my kids and, um, you know, it's just, what I'm getting from welfare is just not cutting it. So I really need to have a job and soon."
Yeah. You're-you're-you're it.
Yeah.
You have to provide for your chavvies.
Mm-hmm.
"Um, and tell me on a scale from one to 10, how confident are you that you could get a job?"
"I mean, right now, I think I'm about at a three. I just seems like, you know, even if I'm able to get into the interview and get childcare, you know, when I show up, I've got this resume that it's- it's not stickin' out and it's got all these gaps of employment and I'm not as educated as other peeps going in for the same job. So I just feel like I'm not, um, I don't know, that employable."
"So, it sounds like, you know, the childcare issue has been getting in the way, and so finding something that would work for you would be really helpful."
Yeah.
And then also it sounds like you're kinda feeling not so gnarly about your resume and your experience.
"Yeah. Yeah, because it's so limited and I've been out of the workforce and even when I was working, I mean, it's not, I don't know, it's not stuff that I feel like can lead to the job that I want now."
Okay. What is it that you- what is it that you want?
"I just want something that is- is gonna be steady and where I can be, you know, even if my kids are in childcare during the day, that I can be home every night and spending time with them and, um, know you really like to get something where, um, I'm just making gradeley spondulicks and- and I don't have to worry all the time about wedge."
"Yeah. Yeah. So, if you had- if you had consistent work, it would change your life in a lot of ways."
Yeah. It would be ginormous.
Mm-hmm. It would provide the income that you need and you wouldn't worry so much.
Yeah. And it'd be canny to just know what I'm doing and just have my routine.
Right. So every day you know where you're going.
Yeah.
"Okay. And you know, what's- what's happening for the- for the day, for the week."
"Right. Well, it would be gradeley if I knew, you know, that my kids are taken care of too-"
Yeah.
- so I'm not worried about them while I'm at work.
Right. Yeah. Because you're- you're the kind of rent that wants to make sure your kids are doing well.
Right.
"Yeah. Um, so tell me, what would it take to get you to like a five in confidence, to feel a ickle bit more confident about getting work?"
"Well, I mean, being able to make the interviews would be the priority."
"Okay, Yeah."
"Um, so chi- you know, taking care, having some childcare, having-"
Mm-hmm.
- having someone I trust that I can call when I know I've got an interview.
Yeah. Because you totes need to go to an interview in order to get the job.
Right. Yeah.
"So having taken care of that part, having some reliable childcare would totes help."
Yeah.
What else would get you to a five?
"Um, I just wish that I had- I had more experience or, um, you know, more education. It seems like everyone's got a college education and I don't have that on my resume."
Okay.
I get asked about education and training and –
"Mm-hmm, mm-hmm."
"- um, you know, I just, it, as soon as I asked about it, I just feel just like I'm not gradeley enough-"
Okay.
- since I don't have that.
"Yeah, so if you had something on your resume that was around education training, maybe a certificate of some kind of a field that you're interested in, that you would feel proud of yourself."
"Yeah. Well, something I could talk about in the interview too. You know, even if I was some type of certification where I could say, I could, you know, with confidence talk about- about that."
"Mm-hmm. Okay. What-- do you have any baldy notions as to what fields you might be interested in getting some more education, more training?"
"I mean, I guess, I just don't really know what it's gonna be because I need to have a job now so I'm not really sure."
Like what's going to be fastest.
"Right. I almost feel like that's more important than what I'm interested in, you know, because I'm like, I'm not going to go back to school for four years right now."
"Okay, and so if- if you were, it sounds like if you were going to do something you'd wanna to do something really sharpish like a short- a short certificate."
"Yeah or something-- yeah, something that I could get immediate skills that would, you know, get me into some kind of a job now, even if it's not my long-term goal or, you know, career just- just get me into something and then I can always focus on."
"Yeah, sort of like a short-term or transition into something else."
Yeah. Gnarly. Exactly.
But that would be steady and pays well?
Mm-hmm.
"Okay, and allow you to afford everything you need to afford."
"Yeah, because even those jobs right now don't feel accessible for me. They seem like, you know-- seems like if-- maybe if I were better on the pooter or you know."
"Okay, so specifically getting some pooter skills will help?"
Yeah. I think so- I think so because I don't-- I can't-- I don't really have anything on my resume that talks about—
The technology.
Yeah.
"Mm-hmm. Okay. So whatever and so far it sounds like getting a job is really important right now and you really need the dosh and you really need to take care of your chavvies and it sounds like you have some baldy notions as to how you could get to these interviews for one, and then once you're there at the interview, feeling more confident about your skills, um, getting some child-- reliable chavvy care deffo sounds very important."
Yeah.
"Um, as well as maybe doing some sort of certificate or getting some classes and training in pooters?"
"Yeah, that would be gnarly."
Okay.
That would be gnarly.
"So what would you like to do next, you think?"
"Well, find the childcare resources-"
"Okay, okay."
- is- seems to be- that seems to be the—
That's a priority.
The priority 'cause I can't even do an interview without that.
Yeah.
"And then, um, I mean-- I guess getting into some type of- some type of a training program that's, you know, short-"
Yeah.
"- like maybe there's a weekend, I mean—"
"Hi, Hannah. Canny to meet you."
Hi.
So I understand that you were referred to me by your GP because you've been experiencing some anxiety difficulties.
"Yeah. Um, yeah, I guess it kind of- it kind of started like five, six years ago."
Okay.
"Um, it kind of escalated a bit. Um, I've just recently moved out, um, from living with my rents. So just made it a bit worse, I think."
Okay. Is this the first time that you've left home?
"Yeah, I am- Yeah. It's the first time actually, yeah. Um, I was going to a few years ago. I just thought it'd be easier to stay at pad, so."
Okay. So it has been quite a big step and a big change and it sounds like that that was what led you to go to your GP.
Yeah.
"So how has that, uh, changed thangs for you?"
"Um, don't know, it's kind of, I haven't really told anyone, so, I mean, it's made it like better in sense. I feel, hopefully this is, this is it like, it- it'll help, but I don't know. I don't like thinking that I've like have to do this. I never thought I'd like be the kind of bod you'd have to actually go and like get help if that makes sense."
Okay. So how do you feel about being here today?
"It's like scared. I don't know. Hopefully, it will help."
"Okay. So you'd, you're feeling a ickle bit wired about today."
Yeah.
"Okay. So I guess just going back to why you went to the GP and how you've ended up kind of coming here today. So it sounds like you've been experiencing anxiety for quite a few years. Um, but just recently you moved out of pad for the first time and, um, and that was what kind of led you to go to the GP. So how did that change thangs? How were thangs after you moved out?"
"Um, I thought that they'd be better, but 'cause I thought I'd have to kind of be independent and I suppose actually a lot worse. So I'm-I'm just kind of staying in the drum a lot. I don't really have any chums or anything. I mean my fam come and visit a bit, but it's not-- I don't know. It's kind of scary because I've just been kind of-- that should just end the flight by myself, which I always thought I'd like, but I don't actually like it."
Okay. So what other kinds of difficulties that you have been experiencing?
"Um, I mean, I'm-I'm a photographer. Um, so I kind of-- It's-it's been stopping me a bit, my anxiety, from being able to get work and because every time, you know, there's, uh, an opportunity that is kind of involving me having to interact with peeps, I just tend to just turn it down. So it was kind of making thangs hard in that respect and um, just kind of fams wise and everything. I just feel like I'm just kind of increasingly more alone. So it's kind of stopping me from making cuzes and, you know, like relationships and stuff."
"Okay. So you said that, um, your difficulties are getting in the way of you doing certain thangs. So they're, they're stopping you from taking up kind of certain types of work and as a freelance photographer, I guess that- that can be kind of a problem. And they're also stopping you or you feel like it's stunting you, uh, socially. You're not kind of able to make new chums and get to meet new peeps."
"Yeah, yeah. Um, it was kind of easier when I was at pad because I was obvs, I mean, my rents, so it's hunky-dory, but you know, they would, I'd go to places with, um, or I'd kind of have peeps there, but more and more, I'm just finding myself just staying in a lot. I mean-- I went like two weeks ago for coffee with my fams and the whole time I was just kind of wanting to go home again. So I don't, I just don't want to-- I don't want that to happen. I don't want to lose everyone. So-"
"So you're kind of worried about how, where this is going to lead to."
"Yeah. Um, yeah."
So you said that you first noticed the anxiety kicking in about five or six years ago.
Yeah.
So you would have been about 19.
Yeah.
And what was happening around that time?
"Uh, I guess I'd finished school about a year before that. Um, and I mean, I-I've always been a bit shy, um, at school, but it was never ever, uh, like it didn't really affect the thangs as much as not at all as much as it has been doing the last few years ago, I guess. It just started when I- like my chums went to uni, and, I don't know, I felt like I was expected to kind of move out or do something and then it just kind of escalated from there.I just stop going to beanfeasts or I'd just say no to invitations or I don't know, I thought my job would help because I mean, I love it. I've- I really like doing photography, but I'm just kind of getting less and less work as it goes on, so, which is my thang, you know, but—"
What kind of work is the most difficult for you in your job?
"I guess when it- I have to kind of be working with other peeps. Um, I don't like that. It's like when I'm trying to kind of- would do an event or something where there's a lot of peeps there, not just photographers, but actual, you know, if I'm like taking places with peeps that I don't know, I just kind of find myself saying, you know, I mean, I want to do them, but just is scary. So I just don't do it."
"So I guess, tell me a bit more about what happens then. So let's focus on maybe an invitation to do a job with, uh, you know, it's going to involve, uh, photography with- with a group of peeps and you're going to have to have social interaction. What kind of thoughts go through your noggin?"
"Um, just, I mean, I get really hot and sweaty, and I don't-- I feel like everyone's kind of looking at me and thinking that I'm just like really saft, and I feel like they're all going to be staring and thinking, I just can't do my job. And I'm just an gobbin. And I mean, they'll think that I just look like a weirdo and I just try and-- I mean, I just kind of just try and get out of the situation or just focus on something else. So that's why I like doing shots where it's just me and the camera 'cause I- then I can just put all my gawm on that instead of having to, you know, be with other peeps."
"Okay. So it sounds like you have quite a lot of thoughts rushing through your chump then at the point where you get that invitation and you think, ""People will look, peeps will stare, peeps will think I'm a weirdo."" So there's quite a lot about what you- what you think other the peeps will think. And how does that make you feel?"
"Um, just makes me feel like an dimmock, makes me feel like I just shouldn't even bother trying to do it anymore. I should just go home and I just-- I think I just don't want to be in that situation. I just feel like everyone else is cushty and they're bog-standard and I'm just the freak, you can't, like do bog-standard thangs and—"
Okay. Can you give me an example of a-a recent situation? Maybe we can focus on that.
"Um, like a work situation or just--?"
"Yeah, time when you were maybe doing a job with some peeps and you felt the social anxiety, you know, that you're describing, you felt that kick in."
"Yeah. I was doing a job where it was kind of like a- a Nature issue and I was having to work with a lot of different peeps. Um, and, um, when they told me about the job, I thought it would be cushty. I thought it was just going to be a few other photographers, but there were actually peeps and, you know, I was taking photos of peeps kind of in the trees and stuff like that. And I guess- they asked me to, um—"
It's quite interesting. Was that a fashion shoot or something?
"Yeah. Yeah. It was a fashion thang. I think it was for some kind of-- I'm not sure if it was a campaign or something, but, it was-"
Okay.
"Yeah, it was, yeah, it was really gnarly, but I find it- found it really hard to try and focus on that 'cause I was so- I was kind of feeling really wired and—"
So it wasn't what you expected?
No. No.
So how long ago was that?
That was two weeks ago.
Okay. So it was quite recent.
Yeah.
"So on that particular day, what were the thoughts that you had in your chump when you were in that situation?"
"I just felt really- just really kind of hot. I couldn't really breathe and just felt like I wanted to just get out. And I was kind of trying really, really hard to just focus, and just, you know, like kind of hold the camera and just not think about anything, but I just felt like everyone was looking at me and like, when they'd say 'action' and they're trying to get me to start and I was just felt like everyone was just thinking I was really saft and I shouldn't have been there and—"
"I can tell you're getting kind of wired, even just thinking about that day."
Yeah.
"Okay. So you're describing quite a lot there to me. So you're saying that you, you kind of got hot and sweaty, you said that you- you held the camera."
Yeah.
"W-what was, do you mean you kind of try to hide behind it or?"
"I was just trying to focus on it. I was just thinking if I could just hold it really tightly, it would just-- I don't know. I'd kind of just be able to just get through it and just focus."
So you're holding the camera very tightly.
Yeah.
W-why was that? Why was that helpful?
"Cause I felt like I was getting really like hot and flushed and I just thought, at least if I can just-- I don't know. It sounds weird, but I was just trying to keep my spuds still on it. 'Cause my spuds were kind of sweaty and like shaking like loads, like, and I could just tell everyone was looking and they could see, and I just thought if I just managed to hold onto it, it wouldn't be as noticeable, but—"
"Okay. So, okay. So it sounds like you had a lot of thoughts going through your chump. Um, you said that you're worried that everyone's looking at you. What other thoughts were there that were in your mind?"
"Just-- I was just, just saft and it was just really-- just felt really like kind of- like everyone was just going to be staring and just thinking that I-- Like- I just felt like everyone was looking at me and just, they could tell. And then just thinking of what was she doing?"
They could tell what—
I was just really like sweaty and just—
"Oh, it was all-all that they could see that-that was-"
Yeah.
Okay.
"Yeah, um, I was trying to wear black so this kind of tries to cover it up and just like a lot of layers, so they can't tell but, I mean, my spuds, like, they were so shaken. I was really red and just was-- Just wishing that I just wasn't there."
"So, I mean, you've already described it to me a ickle bit, but if you think about how you looked that day, how'd-how'd you say, how'd you think you looked?"
"I think just very saft and, like, I think my coupon was really red. I could feel it flushing and I knew that I'd- I was probably sweating and shaking, like my spuds were totes really really shaking. Um, and af-- it was, like totes really noticeable. Everyone could totes see."
Okay and what-what did you do about-- How did you try and conceal that or hide that?
"Um, well, I again was trying to grip the camera, just look down, just trying not to do anything weird or-- 'Cause, I mean, they could probably tell I was being weird any road, but hopefully if-- I just- I just tried really hard to just focus and look down, not trying, like not kind-- look at anyone else and just, yeah, just kind of trying get on with it as best as I could, but—"
So you avoided looking at peeps. It sounds like you wore black as well in kind of preparation any road.
"Yeah, no, I-I always do that even if it's really hot or I wear just loads of layers and just 'cause otherwise I- I'll just be really sweaty and like, peeps would totes be able to see, so."
Okay and how did it end?
"Um, well, it kind of went on for like an hour or so, and then, um, peeps were going, um, just a-after every shoot peeps go out for scoops after just to kind of celebrate like that we've done it. I'd just- I went home straight away, just got on my jam jar and went home. I just didn't want to be around them especially after they would've seen me being weird and I just wanted to get-get yam straight away."
Okay.
"Something clicked, I'd had a bunch to drink and, uh, and I knew I'd messed up. I totes messed up."
How did you know you messed up?
"Because I was- because I was right there, chap. I was right there in the same place when I'd come home and I'd pop a couple of those jimmy hills, it was the same deal, like and I wanted to stay there. I wanted to stay exactly right there. And I just felt like I'd ruined everything. You know, Erin's using the phone now, and he called me the next day and it was, uh, nang, but I kinda felt ashamed of myself, and I don't want to feel that way again."
"Was it that something happened, um, where you put something that was really important to you at punt? Is that what that was about, um, when you say you felt guilty, uh, you felt diabolical talking to Erin on the phone?"
"Because of what-- Yeah, I guess, I think that's what I mean, yeah, yeah. Because you know, I mean- I mean I could have stayed, I could have got, I could have got absobloodylutely hammered and I could have done it every night for the rest of the week."
So you saw yourself putting something that was important to you at punt.
"But I don't know if I stopped because I knew I had to stop or because, you know, it was like right there, that's where I wanted to stay, you know? Anyway, I just, uh-- [crosstalk]."
"Here you are actually, three months on, three long months as you say, um, and thangs have been going really well, Uh, you even get a bit of—"
"They're better, yeah."
"Yeah. Well, and then you get the kind of, I don't know if it felt like a green light or a yellow, it went from red to cautionary, you could see your kids, and that was something that was really what you were working for."
"Yeah, yeah."
"Well, I want to thank you for coming in today to see me. Um, I do understand from talking with your counselor that you've got quite a bit on your plate, you've got a lot going on. Can you tell me a ickle bit about that?"
"Well, um, I have a two-year-old son, and then I work full time as a server at a noshery, and then recently, I also started going back to night class, so you know, just the combination of all that, you know. I-I've just been feeling really stressed lately."
"Yeah, I could see that. Um, may I ask, are you also a single mom?"
Yeah.
"So you've got a lot of stressors right now. You're a single mom raising a two-year-old, you're working full time, and you're going back to school. What do you think would be the most helpful for us to focus on today?"
"Well, I-I told the counselor that I think childcare is probably my-my biggest issue right now."
Okay. Can you tell me a ickle bit about that?
"Yeah. Um, well, my mom normally watches my son, but lately, it's kind of becoming a problem. You know, she like will back out at the last second, and so I've had to call in at work a couple of times. I've had to miss class a few times. So i-it's just stressful worrying about, you know, whether I'll be able to do those thangs or not."
"Okay. So I'm hearing you say that the situation with your mom's not ideal. You actually miss class sometime and had to lose some work shifts as well, and that's problematic."
"Yeah, exactly."
"Okay. Um, outside your mom, is there anyone else that can help with childcare?"
"Um, well, I have a skin, but I don't really trust her to watch my son, and I don't really know that many peeps that-- the only thang I can think of, I have this one neighbor who stepped in and helped one time when my mom backed out. She-she actually has, uh, a three-year-old daughter, so you know, kind of worked out."
Okay.
"Um, I don't really know her that well, but I mean, she seems canny and I-I think she did a pretty canny job that night."
Hmm. So what I hear you saying is this neighbor was supportive when you really needed her to be.
Yeah.
"Stepped in last minute. Um, when you picked up your son, you didn't have any concerns and he seemed chuffed?"
Yeah.
"Okay. Let's pursue that neighbor a ickle bit. Um, peeps like that, I like to think of as natural resources, but I know for a lot of peeps, the major problem with, uh, childcare is affordability."
Yeah.
"Have you given any thought to, if you'll be able to afford to pay someone on a regular basis to watch your son?"
"I-- you know, I mean, maybe a ickle bit, but I don't really make that much spondulicks to be able to afford something like daycare or, you know, like full time babysitting."
"Yeah, I can understand that. Um, what are some of your natural skills?"
"Well, I mean, I-I like cooking. I'm-I'm actually in school for culinary arts."
"Oh, I bet you're a really gradeley cook then. Um, what would you think about a plan where you worked out an arrangement with this neighbor, where in exchange for her watching your son, you would prepare din-dins for her and her, um, daughter?"
Mm-hmm.
"Um, you know, you could maybe swap a nose-bag for chavvy care. What do you think of a baldy notion like that?"
"Hmm. That's, that's interesting. I-I never really thought of something like that, but, yeah, it might work."
"Okay. Okay, I'm glad you think so. Um, so, other than this neighbor, or is there anyone else that could help you?"
"Hmm. No, I-- you know, there-there just aren't that many peeps I trust right now with my son."
"Okay, I can respect that. You-you really have to go with kind of your gut and follow your own intuition on that. Um, what about the baby's old man, is he of any help?"
"[chuckles] No, no, not at all. He, he really hasn't been in the picture since my son was born."
"Okay, hunky-dory. You know what? We've got one really canny lead with the neighbor. I think if you would follow up in pursuing that, you might find some relief and resolve some of your childcare issues. Um, how many days a week are you in school?"
"It's-it's three nights right now, so I have class on Monday, Hump day, and Friday nights."
"Okay. Um, so what would it look like if you had a plan where both your neighbor and your mom were helping you out?"
"Um, well, you know, if my neighbor could even just take over one day of watching my son, I think that would help my mom quite a bit."
"Okay. So what I'm hearing you say is that, if you could just reduce the amount of time that you're needing your mom, she might be more supportive, more onboard?"
"I mean, I think so, yeah."
"All right. Um, so what do you think would be your next steps in working out a plan between your neighbor and your mom?"
"Mom, you know, just, I guess talking to my neighbor and seeing if she's even interested in this baldy notion, and if she is, you know, telling my mom about it and, you know, hopefully, that will make her feel a ickle better and maybe a ickle bit more reliable."
"Okay. Sounds like you got a gradeley plan to follow up on there. All right. Um, now you mentioned that your son is two. When will he turn three?"
Just a couple months from now. He's almost three.
"Okay. Well, in that I-- in that case, I've got another baldy notion for you. Um, what about, um, maybe when he turns three, you could enroll him in Head Start? Are you familiar with that program?"
"I've heard of it, but I don't know that much."
"Okay. Head Start is a very affordable, very high-quality preschool program. Um, it was really created for rents and fams, just like yours, folks who have a lower income and fewer resources, but Head Start really prepares your chavvy both socially and intellectually for going to school. Um, and you know, by the time he turns three, you may find that that routine is something that's better for him to get used to before he starts kindergarten. Uh, would you like some more griff on local Head Start sites?"
"Yeah, I mean, it sounds like it would be really gradeley for my son and, you know, it would help me out in terms of childcare for sure."
"Okay. Well, gradeley. Um, all right. It sounds like you've got a canny plan there going forward. Um, now I did see from the nurse practitioner's notes, you're also working on reducing your smoking and your drinking. How's that going?"
"[chuckles] Well, you know, I-I've been working on it a couple of weeks now, and honestly, it's been a lot harder than I expected. Um, trying to break my routine in the evenings, especially has-has been hard, but, um, you know, a couple of nights I have reached my goal in terms of, you know, number of coffin nails I'm going to smoke and number of belts. So, I mean, I've done okay some days, but others, not so much."
"Okay. So what I hear you say is that it was a bigger challenge than you expected, yeah, but you're working on it. You're-you're still committed to it. So yeah, that's really to be commended. I just want to ask you one thang though. Have you thought about secondhand smoke and the dangers of that and how that might be impacting your son?"
"Yeah, yeah. I totes have, so I-I try to never smoke around him, and if I do smoke at drum, I always go out to the balcony to smoke."
"Oh, okay, gradeley. You know, I can tell you really have your son's best interest at heart here. You know, just from our conflab today, I can tell you're a really mustard mom. Um, let's reflect back on what we've discussed here so far. Now, we've got a couple of waxa options between the neighbor and Head Start programs for childcare. What do you see as your next steps in getting that going?"
"Um, well, I guess just first talk to my neighbor and see if she likes this baldy notion, and then if she does, I can talk to my mom about it. Hopefully, that kind of helps her situation out. And then, um, I'm totes want to look into the Head Start baldy notion because I think that would be really waxa."
"Okay, okay. Good. Um, I think you've got a gradeley plan there. Um, what would you say to us getting back together, say, in two weeks, just for us to kind of revisit and see what kind of progress you've made, you know, if you've got something worked out, coolio, but if you've hit a bump in the frog and toad, I tell you what, we'll put our loaves together. We'll come up with another plan."
Okay.
"All right. Good. Well, I want to thank you again for coming in today, Sarah. It was really canny to have met you."
Thanks. All right.
You're very welcome.
"Hi, Emily."
Hi.
It's been a while.
"Yeah, it's been a while."
This is something new.
"Oh, oh, yeah, the—Yeah"
You got your lip pierced. How long ago did you get that done?
About a month.
Hmm.
Yeah.
What made you decide to get-get a lip piercing?
"Um, I don't know. I just felt like something different. I was getting bored and, I don't know, it's kind of canny to stand out a bit, I guess."
Hmm.
"Yeah, change."
"Yeah, and it looks canny."
Thanks.
"Um, I guess, you know, as your dentist, I have- I have a couple of concerns about lip piercings, oral piercings. I wonder what have you heard about how having an oral piercing can affect your-your choppers or your gums?"
"I don't actually, really. I-I mean, I'm sure that it might push on my gums or choppers, but I don't know how much it will impact that much. I've pretty canny choppers. I don't know."
Mm-hmm.
I don't really know [unintelligible 00:01:04]
You do. you have beautiful choppers as I always tell you-
[laughs] Thanks.
-every time you come in.
Yeah.
"Um, I mean I have had some patients with oral piercings and they can erode some of the gum right, um, just right there at the front."
Mm-hmm.
"Um, so that's one-one thang, and the other is, um, I do see fair amount of chipped teeth-"
"Oh, yeah."
-just from contact with it. I wonder what are your thoughts about that?
"Well, I totes don't want it mess with my choppers. I know I kinda already have low gums to begin with, like you've been telling me for a while, and I have to flo-floss, which I-"
"Yes, flossing."
"Um, which I'm not doing but, um, yeah, I guess, I don't really wanna wreck my choppers 'cause-- Yeah, I didn't really notice any of the chipping."
There's chuff-all yet.
I guess I'm not paying gawm to it.
"Yeah. There's deffo been-- There's no problems and you, as you said, only have had it for a short time."
Mm-hmm.
"Um, what would- what would make you decide, ""This is something that's not right for me?"""
"I don't know, I guess if I started to see that it was actually causing a problem, then I might."
Mm-hmm.
"But for now-- I mean, I just got and-"
Mm-hmm.
-and it looks pretty gnarly.
I guess that it does.
"Yeah, I kinda-- Yeah."
"Yeah, it looks canny. So, you want to monitor it and-and-"
Yeah.
-really watch-
Yeah.
-the effect? Okay.
"Yeah. I guess if I really start to see a problem-- I mean, this might not last forever, but my choppers, I'm hoping-"
Mm-hmm.
-will kind of stick [unintelligible 00:02:30]
"Emily, you said it so well it-"
Yeah.
"-the-the piercing might not last forever, but your choppers really are-"
Yeah.
"-hopefully forever. So, okay, well thanks for-for talking about it-"
Yeah.
"-with me, and also before I do the exam, you know, I'm always on your case about flossing, so maybe we can take [inaudible 00:02:46]-"
"So there are a lot of different directions that we could take. Um, you've mentioned wanting to make changes in your physical activity. You've mentioned wanting to make changes in your eating habits and also just wanting more body confidence. Um, what- what's on your mind is as far as a- as a change topic for the rest of our session today?"
"I think the activity piece is the kind of low-hanging fruit that I see. Um, I feel like it's gonna be harder for me to change some of my nutrition habits right out the gate, but if I can get into maybe an activity routine, that that could be gradeley to help maybe some of the other changes happen later."
Yeah. Okay. So physical activity is feeling like the easiest change to look at first.
"Yeah, I think so."
"Gnarly. So tell me a ickle bit more about your motivators for getting started in being more physically active. I know you shared energy levels and I know you've shared, um, that you'd like to see a boost in your mood and feeling less snarky and stressed. Any other benefits that really make you wanna make this change right now?"
"Yeah, I think just to feeling like physically stronger, um, like physically more able. Uh, last night I like struggled with the jar of salsa, like opening it. So I think that just stuff like that, um, you know, would be in addition to mood and being more productive and energy and all that stuff. Um, yeah, that that would be a definite end goal for me too. And then really to like, I think if I am more active, I think my body image or my body confidence would improve also."
Yeah. So you're wanting to feel stronger so that you can open jars and other thangs and- and also just have a better sense of confidence.
Mm-hmm.
"Gnarly. So on a scale from zero to 10, zero being not at all ready to make a change in the endz of physical activity, and 10 being let's- let's do this. I'm stoked. I'm ready. Um, where- where do you fall on that scale?"
"Hmm, I'd say I'm about an eight."
Okay. So you're- you're feeling fairly motivated.
Mm-hmm.
"Uh, why didn't you pick a six?"
"Well, like I said, I just, I've identified like a lot of thangs that I think would be canny. Um, if I were to be more active and I totes wanna have that improved mood and energy, um, and feel better about myself. Um, so yeah, all of those thangs I think are what's really driving that- that rating."
"Okay. You're noticing there- there are too many gnarly benefits to being physically active and, um, today you've mentioned energy, mood, strength and body confidence."
Mm-hmm.
Am I missing anything else?
I don't think so.
Okay. Those are the big ones for you.
Yeah.
"Mega. Well, um, now we can start looking at if you're interested in how that might look-"
"Mm-hmm, yeah."
"- and- and what activities you might end up, um, choosing."
"Yeah, that'd be gnarly."
Okay.
"Well, thank you, Tanya, for meeting with me today and talking about this. So, there is something I'd like to ask you that we can kind of discuss in our conflab is what's one thang about yourself or something in your life that you'd like to change that maybe you've been feeling kind of ambivalent about?"
"Um, well, you know, I have a lot of anxiety, and so there's this test that I have to take. It's a big test and I've kind of been putting it off just 'cause I get very wired. I don't trust in myself that I'm going to do good at it. Um, and so that's something that's like always on my mind, it's been on my mind for many years and it's like, I gotta just do it. Um, but I always stop myself from doing that because of the anxiety. And I just want to, I don't want to feel that way."
"Yeah. This anxiety is this obstacle for you and it sounds like it, then you're just not feeling confident that you could do it and do it successfully to this exam."
Yeah.
"And so, it's easier for you to just not do it."
"Exactly. So, I just avoid it and put it off."
"Yeah. So, on a scale from 1 to 10, 1 being not confident at all, 10 being very confident. How confident are you that you feel you can manage your anxiety in regards to taking this exam?"
"Um, maybe like a four or five."
"Okay. So, four or five. How combat, like, not like a two or three."
"I mean, because I-I have it set up after like so many years, so I still have a ton of anxiety about it, but I think I'm like kind of making it, maybe that first step. And so that's why I would rate it as like a four or five because I'm making that first step, but it's still scary for me."
"Yeah. Yeah, and you also mentioned that you've actually made the appointment that you have to take this exam."
Yeah.
And before you've been putting it off.
"Yes. And I already kind of put it off after s-scheduling it too. So, um, now I'm actually enjoying that because I-I already like changed date and everything. So now it's actually coming."
"Okay. So, you've made this appointment before in the past and the anxiety has kind of taken over where you've rescheduled it."
Yes.
"And this time, it seems like it's a ickle bit different this time. How come this time you feel like you might not reschedule this time around?"
"Um, well I think it's this kind of long time coming. I just need to do it and then I can figure out, if I don't pass, I have to wait three more months to do it. And then I just study for the next three months. And if I do, then I can have that weight lifted off my shoulders cause it's been all a lot of weight on me and I think about it every single day. And I'm just moby of thinking about it."
So that's really encouraging you thinking about how gradeley you'll feel afterwards once it's done and taken.
"Yeah. But then I do worry, you know, that negative talk that, you know, when you have anxiety. So then I worry about if I don't pass it, you know, like peeps are going to ask me how I did and if I don't pass it I'm gonna have to tell them, it's ladgeful for me. Um, so that makes me really wired."
Yeah. You kind of want to avoid that. Yeah. Have those other feelings that could come up and if you don't have.
Right.
I'd love to hear from you. When was the time in the past that you were feeling wired about something and you actually did it and it turned out well?
"Uh, I would say maybe like four or five years ago, um, I had to do a recording for work and I did not want to do it. I was trying to find every way that I can get out of during this recording. And, um, and then I played my recording and because of the way sometimes I carry myself, like not confident and very wired, um, I think other peeps don't always believe in me."
"And so, um, when I played the recording, it actually ended up being one of the best recordings and like my supervisor and our national consultant, they were very like gobstruck about it because it because of just was the way I carried myself. So I thought, I don't really like compliments that makes me, um, wired too again peeps compliment me, but it was a canny feeling because I really didn't trust in myself. And to know that I did a ream job."
Yeah.
"Um, it made me feel gradeley."
"So, in that experience, it really built up your self-confidence and it almost not only changed the way you saw yourself, but maybe how other peeps saw you and you really, you liked that feeling."
"Yeah, I did."
"Yeah. And that must've been really brave for you to do something that seems really daunting at first, yet you were really successful at it."
Yeah.
"Um, how do you think you could relate that to what you're dealing with now?"
"I mean, I think again, like all that anxiety, the same anxiety I had with that I have with those tests. And so, um, but that if I pass this test, if I could have that same feeling that I had, like when I did a gradeley job like the-- you know, I mean, I would like to have that feeling again."
Mm-hmm
You know.
So for you to create opportunities to create those mos that you can have that feeling again
Right
"And you just mentioned too, you feel really proud of yourself."
Yeah.
"So to end our conflab, how do you think you couldn't move? You originally said, you were at four or five, what would have to happen to get you to like a seven, to feel more confident?"
"Well, considering this test is coming on the way in a few days, um, I think, for me and just like practicing and just really seeing how I do and if I do well, then I think my confidence might go up a ickle bit."
Mm-hmm
"And maybe just having that faith in myself that, you know, that I can do it instead of just thinking that I can't."
So that positive self-talk could really go a long way for you?
Yeah. Mm-hmm.
"So to summarize, it sounds like you are still feeling kind of wired about this test coming up, you've rescheduled it, um, over the past couple years. Yet, this time around, you seem more confident to just get it done. And you've even mentioned times in the past where you were feeling wired and you were successful about it and that you felt proud about yourself. And you liked the way it means, you see yourself and how others saw you, and it seems like y-you're ready to finish this exam and-and remind yourself that you can be successful?"
Yeah.
"Okay. Well, thank you, Tanya."
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.
"Gradeley, so, um, we're here today to talk just, uh, about whatever it is you'd like to talk about it."
"Um, how about if we talk about, uh, the problem that I'm really having is, um, getting somebody motivated to do something, um, such as move out of my drum."
"Okay, so, um, there would be, so what you're, what you're attempting to do is, um, well-- Tell me, I guess, uh, tell me a ickle bit more about it so I understand it a ickle bit more."
"Well, I-I offered my pad to somebody and, uh, for, you know, uh, a transitional period."
Mm-hmm.
"You know, and it seems that, um, it's hard for me to be assertive and say I think the, um, the, uh, transitional period is- has come and it's beginning to time to transition. So."
"So that's a really kind thang of you to do to take someone into your drum like that when they need help like that. And, um, but right now, you're thinking that, uh, time is up you'd like to get this bod, you know, you're-you're-you're ready to have him or her move out and have your place back to yourself."
"Yeah, that's, it's absobloodylutely right that I want, I-I want change but I'm not, I am kind of, like, pissy in that endz where it's, like, the ability to actually say the words. You're right, yeah. I'd like to be able to do that."
"Mm-hmm. And what would, uh, what would help you get to the point of actually, um, booting them out?"
"Um. [sighs] I don't know, I'm-I'm, I guess, I'm kind of, um, I care about the bod and, you know, there's a certain amount of comfortability of having somebody with you, you know, and I'm just, so, I guess I am at war with myself because part of me wants the comfort of having a companion and the other part of me is just, you know-- I-I cannot-- I am not really sure what I wanna do, you know."
"Mm-hmm. So you kind of feel two ways about it. You-you'd like to, um, you feel like at some level that the time is up for that bod to go, and on the other spud, there's a certain amount of security in having him in the drum and in knowing he's around."
"Yeah, you know, it's kind of, like, the old sock- song saying hit the frog and toad Jack, don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no more. [laughs] And—"
But you're not quite ready if you wanna sing that song.
"[laughs] Well, first of all I think he would hit the frog and toad if I started singing that song 'cause I can sing. [laughs]"
"I thought you did a pretty canny job singing there right there, it's scary to be quite honest with you and I appreciate, I also appreciate your sense of humor in-in doing that."
"Well, you know, in life you have to have a sense of humor in my- the way I view and otherwise, you know, I'd be like where's the griff. [laughs] I mean, it's either—"
That really helps you get through thangs is to be able to laugh about it.
"Yeah, yeah, I have to laugh, I mean, even comedians say, you know, uh, most of-- What I've heard about comedians is that they are really not always that chuffed and they use that in a comical way to, you know, deal with life, so, yeah. [laughs] I kind of, maybe I should go into that. [laughs] Like this girl—"
Your new career.
"Yeah, like this girl Ruth that I know she's-she's, uh, got a heavy job and she kind of does that on the side. [laughs]"
"So, um, what are the uh, uh, what would be the benefits to you right now to having him out of the drum?"
"Mm. Let's see. Well, you know, I'm really not sure, I kind of, you know. Um, I'm having a hard time with that. Um."
Tell me a bit more about that.
"Mm, well, I have to really think about it because-"
Some guilt?
"Yeah, yeah. Maybe some guilt and I, um, uh, I just, you know, [sighs] I go back and forth a ickle bit, you know."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Cause you wanna do the right thang because you're- because you're a canny bod and that's a- that's a really important value to you is that you- is that you help peeps out.
"Yeah, I-I- yeah. I mean I- thank you. I-I-I appreciate you saying that I'm a gradeley bod. Like I feel I am. Um—"
But you've done your duty. Duty is done.
"Yeah. Oops, it's just hard to- it's just hard to, um, er, yeah. I- my j- my job is done and I have to start to realize that I have to be a ickle bit more assertive, I think, and a ickle bit more, um, sure of myself."
"And so, what have you done in order to start getting them to Hit The Road, Jack?"
"Well, um, I've had co-conflabs about with him and sometimes not-not so canny, but I'm-I'm just making, you know, 'cause I happen to sometimes just like hold thangs in. And then finally I- at-at one point I was really, you know, very logical about it. And then the other day I kind of got not so logical about it."
Okay.
[laughs]
"So, uh, you were telling me earlier though that you've talked to some other peeps and he has some options about some other places to go to."
Yeah. That's the gradeley thang that he does. And I mentioned them. I-I-I discussed that with him.
Mm-hmm.
"And that gives me a relie- a sense of relief. Like I'm not just, you know, saying yeah. You know, go find your own place or, you know, I mean, there are places where he has a safety net to go to and that-that is something that I think I feel better about and that it makes it easier to discuss and giving them options that he can-- Yeah, yeah, exactly."
"So, you might have to literally like pack his bags and help them get to those places, um."
"Been there, done that. [laughs]"
Okay. Are you-- This is something you've done before.
Yeah.
So whe-when-when are you gonna do it?
"Well, um, I told him within a couple of days is, you know. I think, um, I-I- cause I have future plans, um, and some thangs that are up in the air with me as far as where I'm going to be living in. I've had this place for seven years, but I'm not sure, you know. Every day is a new- a new, uh, winding frog and toad that we go down, you know?"
"Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm."
Um.
And it's kind of scary.
"Oh, God, yeah, yeah. But, you know, and it's scary to have an extra, a ginormous extra trunk that you have to carry with you [chuckles]."
And he's that extra trunk.
"Yeah, yeah."
Okay.
"But I-I mean and it's not that I don't care about him, I do. But you know, it's just like, we're both- we're all adults here, come on."
"Okay. All right. So, it sounds like you-you've actually worked this out until be out within a couple of days."
"Um, that's the goal, you know."
Okay.
"And I don't know what his plans are, but those are my plans."
"Okay. Well, I have a funny feeling your plans will prevail. [laughter]"
"I like your way of thinking, girl. I-I'll tell him that. [laughs]."
"Well, thanks for-for talking and playing with our ickle thangs here."
Thank you
"So, uh, I guess the issue is that, um, you know, my quack seems to think that my-my claret pressure's a ickle high, but I really don't think that there's a problem. And you know, I eat really well. Um. And, you know, she suggested that, um, I watch my caffeine but really, caffeine is not a problem for me."
"Okay. Um, but we were talking a ickle bit earlier-- earlier in our conflab, you had said that you did feel like it was maybe causing some of your agitation. So it's a ickle bit of, I'm not sure of what-- Um, so where are we? Did-did you-- do you feel like you do have some agitation out of coffee, or is it just no problem at all?"
"Well, you know, sometimes it makes me a ickle jittery and, you know, I have to go to the bathroom more frequently than some of my co-workers, but-- And-and working, um, in the hospital, they don't really look so highly on-on going the bathroom frequently. But you know, it-it keeps me awake, it keeps me aware, it-it makes me more able to like, you know, do my job better. And so I really don't see that it's a-it's a real issue."
Yeah.
"Um, you know, and-and-- I mean, maybe my claret pressure is a ickle high, but—"
"Yeah. So let me see if I had this. So y- so you got some positives, the-the awareness, and then you feel kinda on your game?"
Mm-hmm.
"Um, and then there's some negatives with, um, you know, your-your co-workers, um, that they don't, you know-- then your head-honcho may not want you, you know, checking out-"
Right.
"-on the hospital floor, you know, for frequently."
"Gotta stay on, yeah."
"Yeah, yeah, and then the claret pressure thang. Does that sound about right?"
"Yeah, yeah. Well, you know, and sometimes, like I said, it does kind of make me a ickle jittery and, um, I don't know. I-I-I'm not- I'm not as chuffed and relaxed as I normally am. But you know, I-I really like it, and-and like I said, it makes me more aware of what's going on and-and I'm-- I-I feel like I'm much more observant."
Yeah. How about frequency? Do you feel like you're gradeley on how much coffee you're drinking?
Yeah. I have about four cups a day.
Okay. Okay. And that feels about right to you?
"Yeah. I mean, I've-- I mean, it's the co-workers that-that work at night. Gosh, they bring in a carafe."
Mm-hmm.
"And, uh, I-I can only imagine-"
Yeah.
-what-what their bodies are like.
"Yeah, yeah. What would happen if you-- if you looked at, maybe reducing that with that habit? Would that get rid of maybe some of the thangs that are problematic?"
"Reducing it, like-- what do you mean?"
The number. Just the number.
"Yeah, yeah but, I mean, how-how much are we talking?"
"I don't-- you tell me. I mean, um, you're-you're drinking four a day."
Mm-hmm.
Um--
"You're probably-- you know, because I-I gotta have that morning cup, I really-- you know I really like waking up and-and that whole ritual. The, um-- you know, making the coffee and-"
Yeah.
-I just really like the flavors.
Yeah.
"So I-I totes don't want to give that up, but—"
I gotcha. Okay.
Uh—
So that one's important.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
"And then, of course, you know, working a 12-hour shift, I-I really think that, you know, the avvy to keep me going until the evening is-is a really canny baldy notion too."
Yeah.
I could probably get up the mid-morning.
I think that's gnarly.
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
I think so. So you've identified one of the four that might-- you might be willing to-to try-
Mm-hmm.
-for a while to-to let go of. What do you- what do you think of that?
I think that does sound all right.
Okay.
Yeah.
Good.
I think I could do that.
-- doing today?
"I'm gradeley, thanks."
Good. Why don't you fill me in on what's been going on since I saw you last?
"Um, I guess everything's hunky-dory. I think my caseworker mentioned something about community service that I have to do or something. I don't know."
Okay.
I'm not sure of that.
"So she talked to you a ickle bit about it, but it sounds like you're kind of unsure exactly the skinny."
"Yeah, I know that she said I have to get so many hours in, but I don't- I don't know. I kind of was half-listening."
Okay. So why don't you tell me what you remember from having your conflab with your case manager? What do you know so far about community service?
"I know that I have to get it done by the end of my probation, except I forgot like how many hours or if I'm supposed to find it or someone else is gonna find it for me or I-I told you I'm scrambled."
"Okay, gotcha. So, you know, that it needs to get done-"
"Yes.-you know, you have till the end of your probation-"
Yes.
-but you're a ickle fuzzy on the skinny.
"Exactly, yeah."
"Okay. Um, so maybe if it's okay with you, I can share with you some of, um, the requirements, maybe go over the skinny a ickle bit more."
"Yeah, yeah."
Is that all right?
Mm-hmm.
"Okay, gnarly. Um, so with your community service I know you've got 25 hours left to do, um, so that does need to get done by the end of your probation, and your case manager is a really coolio resource to help you find a place where you can do it. So I know in the past some clients have done their community service at nom nom pantries or shelters, or anywhere in the community that's not, you know, a fam member or a pal. Um, the urban ecology center is a really nang place. You can kind of work outside, work with younger kids. Do any of those options seem like a fit that you might be interested in?"
"Um, yeah, I just, so I still have to find the community service hours myself?"
So that's something that you can work with your case manager on.
Okay.
"So, um, that's something you can absobloodylutely ask her or quest- or me some questions about, but they'll be able to come and bring you some options-"
Okay.
"-of places that you can work with, some phone numbers to call."
Okay.
"And that is something that we'd kinda like to see you do on your own, but if you're really feeling like you're struggling, those are phone calls that either you and I can make together or you and your case manager can make together."
"Okay, so I would do that. And then do you know, can I get all the 24 hours in in like a weekend or how does that work?"
"Well, I mean, 24 hours in a weekend sounds to me like it might be a lot of time."
[unintelligible 00:02:20]
I can- I can hear that you are really eager to just get it finished-
"Oh, yeah."
"-and get it out of the way. Maybe I know in the past it's been helpful for some other clients to sit down and take a calendar and just mark out, okay, I'm gonna do five hours this day, I'm gonna do three hours this day, two hours of this day. Does that sound like something that might be helpful for you?"
"Yeah, I think, just to keep track of it better."
Okay.
I think it's a gradeley baldy notion.
"And then, you know, it might be, I totes think that if you're committed and it's summer break, it's something you could easily get done in a week."
Okay.
What other questions do you have for me about community service?
"I think that's it. I think I was just worried about who was gonna do it for me, but I know I have to, I guess, do it myself and that 25 hours has to be done. It seems like that's the time I'd have to get done."
"Yup, absobloodylutely."
Okay.
"But you know that if you have any more questions, you can always come to me or your case manager and we're here for- to be a support for you."
"All right, thank you."
You're welcome.
"Right. Hi, Ruth, thank you for coming today. How are you?"
"Um, okay. Just, I don't even know why I'm doing this anymore. I'm-I'm just so saft. I'm such an gobbin. I didn't know what the point of-of this is. I just- I just keep doing the same thang over and over, even though I know it can kill me. I just, I don't have any more willpower, ma'am. Yeah, [foreign lingo]."
"Well, Ruth, it sounds like you're very frustrated first of all. And you're saying that you're just whacked. You've lost all your willpower."
Mm-hmm.
You don't want to continue.
"No, it just seems that cutting myself is the only way out. And I just get suicidal thoughts and [foreign lingo], I'm just very, very like hacked off and what's going on at pad."
"So you feel really, really like you've had it up to here."
Yeah.
Yeah. You're-you're whacked. You're stressed. You feel so sad to the point that you're hurting yourself physically so that you can feel something other than what you're feeling right now.
"Yes. Sometimes a pain in-in the body. It's, uh, to [unintelligible 00:01:27] handle and-and the pain inside of me."
So you were in a lot of pain?
Yes. I am.
"I'm sorry about that. It must be very, very frustrating to feel all that pain and not be able to do anything about it. And it seems like the only thang that you can do right now is to cry."
"Yeah, yeah, suicide."
"It's okay, Ruth. I understand. Pain inside."
[foreign lingo]
"So your mom doesn't understand you and you don't have a dad, that's around?"
"Yeah, 'cause she's a single mom and she struggles a lot. I wanna help her, but I can't help her. So it just makes me sad. I feel like if I don't live anymore, she'll be okay. And she wouldn't have to worry about me or pay my stuff."
"So you feel like your spuds are tied, you feel like you're a burden to mom. She's a single rent. She works a lot. You have all of these problems in your life. And it sounds to me like you feel like you're just adding more problems to her."
Yeah.
"And if you're not alive, that's gonna solve the issue for her. She'll do better."
I-I think so?
How is she gonna be better off without you?
Because it won't be a burden to her.
And how are you a burden now?
"Because she has to pay for my nose-bag and my uniforms, um, to have a roof over our noggins."
And how do you help her now?
"Um, I try to be a gradeley kid. I tried to go to school. I may not have the best grades, but I'm not failing any classes."
"Okay. So then even by you coming here today, Ruth, and talking to me and opening up and telling me that you don't feel like you want to continue moving in and telling me and-and confiding in me that, you know, you hurt yourself and all this pain that you feel, that is you trying to help yourself out in one way or another. And that shows that you care. And even more, it shows that you care about your mom and that, in the end, it doesn't sound like you wanna leave her alone because you're still worried about ot-you're still worried about all the burdens on her that you're even thinking of removing yourselves to make her life easier. That shows me that you care about her so, so much, but right now the immediate solution that you have in your mind, it seems like it's-it's-"
That's the right one.
"-How could it be the right one? Ending your life hurting yourself when it's just you and your mom. And you just said, she's a single rent. She doesn't have a husband, you don't have a dad. It's just the two of you. So how could it be the right choice? But I understand your pain and I know where you're coming from. And I know that the release that you feel physically is something that helps you in the mo. Are there other thangs that we can help you find to start replacing, um, that behavior?"
"Um, I don't know. I don't know. It's just, um, I'm not sure I can."
"You're not sure. So you have a lot of on your mind right now. You just opened up to me. You told me that you've been cutting, that you've also been thinking about hurting yourself, killing yourself, not being here. Short-term, the cutting is helping you. You feel like a burden to mom, that stresses you out. That makes you sad. You see how much she struggles, but also on the same spud, we see how much you've been trying and how much you've been trying to help out by trying to go to school. We know your attendance is canny. You go most of the time, you know, you're trying to keep up your grades.You have a C average, even having A in math, which we know was the lowest grade you had all semester. So all of those thangs shows how much stick you've put in and we see that stick. So you've been doing what you can and it's bog-standard to feel like sometimes it's not enough. But that's-that's what we're here for so that you can tell us those thangs and we can help you."
"Thank you, ma'am, I feel better."
"Oh, thank you, Ruth. Thank you for coming today."
Okay.
"So, Tommy, I wanted to talk to because I was on Facebook the other day and saw some pictures that are kind of concerning to me of you and some of your charvers at a beanfeast, and, you know, you're such a mustard kid. Like, I don't know what you're doing drinking. It's going to ruin your life."
"Um, I mean, it was just the, like a social gathering. It wasn't like I was looking for it, uh, the sherbets were there and I-- all my chums were doing it and it was just-- it's-it's not something that I like do occa- on occasion, but whenever the opportunity presents itself, it-it's canny to just let loose and have a ickle bit of fun sometimes."
"But, Tommy, there's so many consequences with drinking. You know, you're not even 21 yet, you could get arrested, you could, you know, have a pickled driving prang. You could, you know, horlicks up your schoolwork. You have such a bright future ahead of you. It just really, really concerns me."
"I-I get what you're coming from, but I-I-I really did. I-I thought that I had it under control and I didn't let myself get too far gone. I-I didn't want to be, um, how do I put this? Like, I want it to be in control and I wanted to make sure that all my charvers were okay, so I didn't let myself drink too much."
"There's really no such thang as not drinking too much. I mean, anything that's drinking when you're underage is drinking too much, you know. Like, think about it, think about all the thangs that can happen to you."
Yeah. I-I understand exactly what you're saying. And—
How much are you drinking?
"I-I don't think I'm drinking that much. I mean, it's-it's mainly for social gatherings. Like it's chuff-all that I do, like by myself or whatever. It's just the—"
Is it like every weekend?
"Every other weekends, I would say."
"Tommy, I'm just so stuffed, you know, can't you think of anything better to do?"
"Um, I-I guess I can. I-I can probably be more productive in my schoolwork and rather than going out to beanfeasts as much and I-I do get you're coming from and—"
"Yeah. Is-- are your charvers the problem, like maybe you should just start hanging out with more kids in the youth group and not hang out with those kids that you were partying with?"
"Yeah, I guess I haven't really put it on myself. I guess it's really been forced on their account. And I've just been following in their footsteps just to-- just because it seems like what they're doing is a lot of fun. And I just want to make sure that I'm getting every bit of the high school experience that I can."
"Well, there's a lot of thangs that seem fun in the mo that we know aren't a mustard choice, right? That's some of the thangs we talk about all the time is making ream choices for our life and-and really doing what's best for you. And I just, you know, I really think you should think about making a big change here."
Mm. Yeah. I-I-I do see that maybe me drinking not as much would possibly better my life to-to a certain degree. And I-- it does make a lot of sense. And I-I guess I can put more stick into sort of lowering the level of drinking that—
I think you really need to quit.
"Yeah. I mean, poison is just so prevalent in our society and it's just around me, wherever I go and beanfeasts and stuff that. I-I kind of feel like I should just, uh, get used to it or at least understand its, uh, its effects before I should let it get out of my life totes. I don't- I don't really see it as something that will totes destroy my life."
"I think you're pete tong. You know, it really worries me. Anyway, um, I wish you would quit. If all you're going to do is cut down, that's better than chuff-all. You know, I appreciate you talking to me about this, but I'm gonna keep talking to you about it. It's really important."
Yeah. I-I-I just-- I don't see the problem in it right now and maybe it's because I haven't really had that traumatic of an experience but I'm—
Do you wanna wait for that happen? Do you wanna wait for a dramatic experience?
"You're-you're right. I-I don't want- I don't wanna be too far gone before it's too late. Like I-I can imagine something possibly happening where it's to a degree where I can't escape. And I-I guess I've never really had any-any real experience where the poison has really affected me that much or affected anybody close to me that much. So I guess it's something that I feel like I'm control of, but in reality, I might not have as much control as I think."
"All right. Well, maybe it's something we can work on together. And, you know, I think we should come up with a plan that's gonna work for you so that you can get control here and stop drinking."
Yeah. I-I think that that would be a gradeley step forward into-- and a life of possibly being sober and just experiencing the true- the true aspects of life rather than the-the haziness of poison.
"Okay, sounds gradeley."
Okay.
"All right, Chris, so I need to talk to you because as you know, we have a zero-tolerance policy for drugs and poison at this school. And as-as athletic director, it's my job to check in with our student-athletes and make sure everyone's adhering to that rule. And I've been hearing some chatter from some of the other kids about a beanfeast this weekend, and from what I hear, where you were there and, you know, I can't confirm or deny anything. So I'm not at the point where I can give you consequences, but I did want to talk to you about whether or not you're drinking and how, you know, you really can't be doing this as a member of one of our teams."
"Right. Actually, I do want to speak to you about something that happened during this past weekend. Usually, as, you know, I'm, um, I'm an honor student. I-I usually I'm studying over the weekend and my rents don't let me go out to beanfeasts, but I kind of use that to my advantage, to convince my rents to go to this beanfeast that my pals were pressuring me to go to. And when I- when I got there, like I'm not used to this like beanfeast environment where everything you see in the flicks is kind of what happens, where you have peeps just drinking out of the bottle-"
Mm-hmm.
"-or playing random games with poison, just to get snockered for no reason. And because I was there in the mo, I felt pressured to do and like conform to what everyone else was doing. So I wouldn't be- I wouldn't be ostracized."
"Yeah, you know, I get it. Like, we've all been there. Okay. You know, I was in high school ones too, you know, I drank too. I get it. There's not a ton to do in this town a-and kids drink, but, you know, promise we have these rules-"
I understand.
"-and you're on a team, you have to stick by the rules."
"Okay. Um, I know that it's diabolical for me. It's-it's diabolical for my body. It's diabolical for-for-for-for being on the team, for being an athlete. It hinders my performance. Just, I don't know. I-I feel that my-my cuzes pressure me. I don't know. I feel I should like go with different pal groups. Maybe. I don't know."
"Yeah. Chris, come on. You're getting peer pressure?"
"I don't know, like being in a sports team, y-you feel very, you have to like be unified with the group."
"Yeah, but you're one of the leaders."
"Right. And as being one of the leaders, my fellow teammates expect me to be-- I expect them to lead not only in the sports but also in social environments. And if that's a social- that's a social custom in our society. So it's like—"
"Yeah. Well, maybe you can start leading as a non-drinker then."
"I could, but that could also backfire on me. I feel that I could be ridiculed for being, having a stick up my butt, you know."
"You're a star player, who's going to pick on you?"
"I mean, it's just one-- I'm just one bod against the voice of the mob."
"All right. Well, yeah. So the issue again is I can't be hearing reports about you drinking. I can't be hearing that you're at beanfeasts and you can't be seeing pictures on Facebook. You know, there-there are rules at this school and in my job, I have to enforce them. So, you know, like I said, I get it, you know-"
I understand.
"-I'm not saying I know what it's like. I-I get that you want to have fun in your teenage years. I get that. But, you know, you are a star player, we want to keep you on the team. You know, we got to figure out a way to get through this."
"Well, I'll dedicate the time, not to beanfeast and night. Well, not-not-not beanfeast, but, you know, get involved with poison to that extent. And like, have it publicized on the internet."
What do you mean?
"Like on Facebook, all the pictures that you saw on the internet. Like I w- I will avoid those situations where I have to go to a beanfeast where I feel pressured to actually drink poison and allow what I do in my own private time to put on the internet so others can see, even though."
"All right. Yeah. I mean, we got to have a deal here if you're going to be on the team. Okay?"
Right. I'll stop.
All right. You promise?
I promise.
All right. Shake.
Shake.
All right. I'll see you later.
See you later.
All right.
"Hi, Laura. So, thanks for coming in. I'm not sure how much you know about why you're here or what we're supposed to talk about. So, basically, I'm going to be meeting with all the students in the school usually once or twice per semester. And we're going to talk about, you know, whatever's kind of going on in your life. I'll ask you some questions about, you know, your goals and what you like to do for fun and those sorts of thangs. And then we'll talk a ickle bit about, you know, different behaviors and-and stuff like that. And so, it's-it's pretty casual, pretty informal, just sort of a chance for me to get to know you if that's all right."
Okay.
Okay. Why don't we start by just having you tell me a ickle bit about yourself?
"Okay. Um, my name is Laura and I'm 17 and I'm a senior in high school."
Okay. And what do you like to do for fun?
"Um, mostly just hang out with my charvers and stuff on the weekends, thangs like that."
"Mm-hmm, and when you and your charvers are hanging out, and what- what do you do? Do you go to fitba games, go to beanfeasts?"
"Uh, yeah, if it's school-related, maybe like a game or two, or go to the mall, like, to shop or go to the flicks or something, and at night, maybe like a beanfeast or something if someone's throwing."
Okay. And what kind of hobbies do you have?
"Um, I like to read and I like to go outside and, like, take danders and, like, hike and stuff. I'm very outdoorsy, so-"
"Oh, cool. What are your plans for after high school?"
"Well, I plan to apply to college and maybe, you know, have a gradeley career and something like that, hopefully."
That's gnarly. What do you think you'll study?
"Well, I'm-I'm looking at the journalism, maybe pre-law."
"Oh, neat."
"-which is a ickle different, but-"
"Yeah, that's gnarly. That's a really canny goal."
Yeah. Thanks.
"It's, uh, hard work to get into law school. Are you doing well in school? What kind of grades do you get?"
"Yeah, I'm doing okay. I'm getting mostly A's and B's, so I'm pretty gradeley, I'm okay."
Okay. What classes are you not getting A's and B's in?
"Um, I think all my grades are A's and B's, so, yeah."
Okay. And do you know where you're going to apply to college?
"Um, I'm not sure yet, but I'm looking into schools like in the endz, so maybe, I don't know, maybe I'll leave drum or something."
"Okay. Cool. And, you know, what made you decide maybe law school or-or journalism?"
"Um, well, I'm totes not a math or science bod, so I started off by there that I started looking at careers that maybe I would like. So-"
"Okay. Gnarly. Sounds like you have, like I said, really canny goals and you're working hard in school. Um, you said that when you're going out with your fams, you like to hang out and shop and stuff like that and also go to beanfeasts, so do you drink poison?"
"Um, not really. Maybe one or two sherbets at a beanfeast at the most."
Okay. And how often do you think you drink?
"Um, maybe like once or twice a month at the most."
"Mm-hmm, so like once or twice a month you're having poison?"
Yeah.
"Okay, and so that's maybe like 20 times a year."
"Possibly, yeah."
So that's actually kind of a lot of drinking then?
"Yeah, I guess you can say that."
Okay. What do you think is the most you've ever had?
"Um, just two sherbets at a beanfeast at the most. I don't-- I don't like to drink a lot. I don't-- Getting minced is not something that appeals to me. So, I just have, like, a sauce in my spud, so my fams won't bug me about not drinking. It's just like to look like I'm actually doing something. Most of- a lot of the time, I don't even drink at all. So-"
But you've been pickled before?
"Um, no, not really, maybe half-cut, but not like snockered."
"Okay. Um, so the most you've ever, ever had is two sherbets in a day."
Yeah.
"Okay. Interesting. So, do you know all the diabolical stuff about poison?"
"Um, yeah, yeah."
"Okay. Um, so one of the thangs that, you know, is really important to talk to teenagers about is drinking and driving. So, um, you know, that's actually a really big problem. And even around here, we have kids die every year from getting in a snockered driving prang. So that's something that you really need to make sure you're not doing, all right? Have you ever done that? Have you ever gotten in the car-"
"No, I have drunk-driven and never got in a jam jar with a snockered driver."
"Okay. Uh, how much do your charvers drink?"
"Um, I mean, I have some charvers that drink some more than others, like, my close group of chums don't really drink as much because I'm not really interested in that, but I know that there are peeps that drink a lot more."
"Okay. What about at these beanfeasts you're going to, are there other kids there who are drinking a lot?"
"Yeah. There are kids that drink a lot more than I do. Totes, yeah."
And do you hang out with them?
"Not really closely, like, I know who they are and I'll say hi, but not-- They're not really, like, close charvers of mine."
"Mm-hmm, so, you know, even just hanging out around kids who are drinking a lot actually puts you at a lot more punt. Did you know that?"
"Um, yeah. That makes sense."
"Yeah, so, there, I mean, a lot of the other dangers of drinking, like, um, not just jam jar prangs, but you can have other prangs, you know, peeps, um, you know, will fall or, um, you know, break thangs or a lot of peeps actually end up breaking their bones and ending up in the emergency pad because they've been ruined and falling down or, you know, as a girl, it's really important too that you're careful because you could be sexually assaulted."
Yeah.
"You know, especially if you've been drinking, then, you know, you're at a lot more punt because a guy can take advantage of you. Did- have you thought about that?"
"Yeah, yeah, I have. That's, uh, one of the main reasons that I don't like to drink that much."
Mm-hmm.
So-
"And then, um, you know, peeps get in swedges more often when they've been drinking too. Um, also, you know, there have been a lot of kids, even at this school, who've gotten in hoo-ha because they were drinking and someone took pictures with their cell phone and put it up on Facebook-"
Yeah.
"And then their rents find out or the school finds out and, you know, we have a no-tolerance policy here about drugs and poison, and really can get you into hoo-ha, and it could put your whole college career in jeopardy. Have you thought about that?"
"Yeah. Totes, yeah."
But you're still drinking.
"Um, yeah, I mean, I guess it's the thang to do at a beanfeast, so-"
"Uh-huh. So, I mean, do you think it's the thang to do if you wanna be an attorney?"
"Um, totes not. That's why I don't try to drink that much. Just-"
Mm-hmm.
"-make it look like I am, kind of."
"Mm-hmm. Okay. Hmm. So, I mean, I guess what we need to do then is kinda talk about some goals for how to be-"
Okay.
-safer.
Okay.
"Um, obvs, you shouldn't be drinking at all. Um, what do you think about that?"
"I totes agree. I know that there are some other punts involved in poison, they are the ones you mentioned, like, health-wise and thangs like that, so, I agree that poison may not be the best thang."
"Mm-hmm. So, do you think you can quit?"
"Um, yeah, I mean, it's not, like, a really big part of my life, so."
"Okay. So, I'm going to write down then that you've decided to quit."
Okay.
"And, um, that's gonna be your goal, and that's gnarly, you know, that's really why we're here, is to talk about that and-and make sure that you come to that decision. Um, so, I guess, can you quit this weekend then?"
"Yeah, yeah, totes. I'll just not have a shant."
"Okay, and then what about your charvers who are still drinking?"
"Um, I really can't control what they do, but I'll totes try to get my closest chums to maybe stop like I will."
"Okay, and-and what if they won't?"
"Well, then, I guess, I'll just try to hang around them less or something. I'll try to find thangs for us to do that don't involve poison like a beanfeast or anything."
"Yeah. Probably if your charvers won't quit drinking, you should just find new chums."
Okay.
"'Cause, you know, the problem is if they're drinking, they're gonna pressure you into drinking and then you're gonna feel caggy handed and, you know, you're gonna be stuck and-and not know what to do and really you'd just be better off probably without them. If they're- if they're the kind of peeps who are gonna keep drinking-"
Yeah.
-they're probably not a gradeley influence.
"Okay, yeah."
"Um, and then, then you'll be better set for college too because, you know, the issue is you're getting gradeley grades now, but when you get to college, it's a lot harder and, you know, if you're needing really canny grades to get into law school, which you will need, then you really can't be distracted by poison."
"Okay, yeah, totes."
"Okay, so, um, that's gnarly 'cause it pretty much covers all the stuff that I think I needed to go over with you. Um, let's see. I guess we didn't talk about what would happen if your rents found out you were drinking."
They would be pretty pissed off. Yeah. They don't really condone poison use.
Mm-hmm.
So-
"Okay, so, yeah, just another reason why you probably need to just quit then. Um, okay, yeah. I-- Okay, so, like I said, I'm gonna right down here that you've decided to quit and, um, uh, you know, I'm gonna be meeting with you again probably in the next semester sometime, so we can kinda check-in and-and make sure that, you know, that's still going well-"
Okay.
"-and you're still not drinking and not hanging out with any peeps who are drinking. Um, is there anything else you'd like to talk about while you're here?"
"Um, no, no. I think I'm gradeley."
"Okay. Um, any questions or anything-"
"Uh, no."
-like that?
I have no questions.
"Okay. You're sure? Okay. All right. Um, well, that's probably it then. You can, uh, head back to class and-and thanks for coming in."
"Okay, thanks."
"Hey, hi, Andrea. Thanks for coming in today. So I don't know how much you've been told about why you're here, but basically, it's my job just to meet with all the students. I usually meet with you once or twice a semester. And I'm going to be talking to you kind of about your life and your goals and some behaviors that you might engage in and just the sorts of thangs like that."
Okay.
So why don't you start by telling me a ickle bit about yourself?
"Uh, well, my name is Andrea, as you know, I'm, uh, in the marching band. I play the tenor sax."
Oh.
"Yeah. I'm involved in music. So I'm also in the jazz band, the wind ensemble, and um, yeah, that's about—"
Okay.
I'm an IB student.
Okay. How long ago did you start playing saxophone?
"Well, saxophone. I started about four years ago, but I've been involved in music for about 10 years now, so."
Wow. That's a long time. What other instruments?
I started off on the violin first.
No kidding.
"So I played that for like six years, once a clarinet, dabbled here and there with different thangs. And then I found the one- the one for me."
That's awesome. And you play tenor sax?
"Yeah, the tenor sax."
Wow. And how long have you been in marching band?
Marching band since freshman year. So like three years.
Okay. Couple of years. Gnarly. And how do you like Marching Band?
"It's fun. It's a- it's a lot of work, long summers taught, but it's fun."
What are your favorite parts about it?
"Oh, I really like the-the group setting."
"Oh, okay."
"You know, getting to work with my other classmates and thangs like that. And putting on this entire show-"
Uh-huh.
"-it's very exciting, very exhilarating once you're in competition."
Okay.
It's very gnarly.
Cool. And do you have a lot of charvers who are in band with you or-
Yeah.
-friends outside of band or?
"I have, um, you know, I have two-two separate groups. I have my charvers from class and then my chums from bra-- from band."
Okay.
So.
"Gnarly. And then, um, tell me a ickle bit about your fam?"
"Oh, well I have one bro he's older than me, about nine years older than me."
"Oh, wow."
"And, uh, my rents and my dog. [laughs]"
Okay. What kind of dog do you have?
He's a golden retriever.
"Oh, canny."
Charlie.
Charlie.
He's a big charver. Yeah.
"Oh, dinky. Have you had him a long time?"
Yeah. He's about eight years old now.
Oh gosh. Yeah. Okay. Very gnarly. And what are your plans for after high school?
"Uh, well, I'm planning on going to school. I'd like to become a quack one day, so."
Wow.
"I'm interested in psychology, psychiatry, something like that, so."
You've got big dreams.
Yeah.
Cool. All right. Have you started thinking about schools or majors? I guess you're thinking about psychology as a major.
"Yeah, psychology, I haven't really thought too about which school, I mean, I-"
Right.
"Everyone wants to shoot for the Ivy leagues, so [chuckles]"
All right. And how about your grades?
"Uh, they're pretty gradeley, you know, high three-point somethings."
"Okay. Good. Very gradeley. All right. Well, what are the kinds of thangs do you do for fun on weekends?"
"Uh, I usually go out with my charvers. Uh, we'll go to the flicks or we'll most likely we'll just meet up at someone's house-"
Mm-hmm.
-and just hang out and thangs.
"Mm-hmm. When you're hanging out, is there ever poison?"
"Sometimes, [chuckles] I'm gonna be honest sometimes."
Uh-huh So how often do you think you drink poison?
"Um, depending on how much schoolwork there is When there's not, it might be like every other weekend or like three weekends out of the month or something like that."
"Oh, so you're drinking a lot?"
"A ickle, yeah."
Okay. And how much are you drinking on the days that you're-- on the days that you drink?
"Um, I don't, we don't get blackout pickled or anything. It's more of like a ickle half-cut kind of thang."
Mm-hmm.
I have gotten blackout pickled before-
Mm-hmm.
"-but I kind of did that, learned my lesson, didn't like it."
Got it. So you've-you've had some pretty heavy drinking. What-what do you think is the most you've ever had?
Like how many sherbets?
Yeah.
"Um, it was a gradeley amount. It was the first time I ever drank and it was like three or four cups, but it was mixing different thangs."
"Okay, so you don't even know."
"So, I'm not-- Yeah."
"Okay. So, and then your charvers drink too?"
"Yeah. Yes. Not all of them, but some of them do."
Okay. And how much do they typically drink?
"More or less the same amount. So right now the most we'll have is maybe like one cup after that one time, but sometimes one or two, but they can be kind of heavy."
"Okay, so it's one cup, but it's not-not one sherbet."
"Oh, it's a red, you know, typical. Yeah."
It has a lot of poison in it.
Mm-hmm.
"Okay. Um, so gosh, you're-you're actually really drinking quite a lot. Um, you know, your level of drinking puts you in what we call a high-punt group."
Mm-hmm.
"So, is that surprising to you?"
A ickle bit.
"Yeah. Um, so we call it high-punt because it means that there's actually quite a bit of chances that you're gonna have some diabolical consequences from drinking like that. So, you know, thangs like, um, having jam jar prangs, or other prangs, or getting in ding-dongs, or, you know, sexual assault, or health problems, or developing alcoholism. Have you thought about those thangs?"
"Not too much, to be honest. I-I've always thought since it's, you know, within my piddly group of friends-"
Uh-huh.
"-and we usually sleep over each other's drum, we don't get into the problems of drinking and driving, and possibly sexual assaults and thangs like that."
Uh-huh.
But I haven't really thought about possible alcoholism or anything.
"Okay. So it's, um, so it's gradeley, because you're not drinking and driving, but you're still really drinking a lot. Um, and yeah. Okay. So, let's-let's talk a ickle bit about that, how you might be able to make some changes. Because I think you really need to- need to stop drinking like this."
Okay.
"So, um, do you think you could quit drinking or?"
"Yeah, I think I could. I don't need it. For instance, it-it is-- it is used as a kind of, like, let's get the beanfeast going."
Uh-huh.
But we haven't always had it-
Uh-huh.
"-obviously. So, I think it would be possible to stop drinking."
"Okay. So, does that mean you're gonna stop drinking?"
"Um, I would probably start off by like, because my charvers are also involved, so I'd be like, ""Hey, guys, I don't think I'm gonna drink today."""
Uh-huh.
And kind of see how that goes. Because—
"Okay. Um, you don't sound very much like you think that's gonna work."
"Yeah. It's, you know, it's one thang to control my own drinking, and it's another thang when everyone else around me is drinking and then there's like that pressure-"
Mm-hmm.
"-of, ""Oh, they're gonna think I look saft."""
"Okay. So, how are you gonna quit drinking without your charvers thinking you look cakey?"
Yeah.
"Okay. Um, so I mean, do you think they're really gradeley chums of yours if they're gonna give you such a hard time?"
"My close ones, I know they wouldn't be, you know, have a problem with that. But the ones that I'm not that close with, but I'll still like hang out with-"
Uh-huh.
-those are probably the ones that like might ostracize me for something or.
It sounds like you might be better off without them though. They’re-
Yeah.
- maybe not very gradeley chums.
"Probably, might be too judgmental."
"Mm-hmm. So, um, so I think we should set a goal that you're gonna stop drinking."
Okay.
"And, um, I think you should probably stop as soon as possible, like this weekend."
Okay.
"Um, so the way this normally works is, you know, we set you a goal, and then I'll have you come back and we'll talk about it again in a couple of weeks and make sure that you actually stopped. Um, and so what do you think about that?"
"Um, I think-- I think the possibility."
Okay. So-
"I think if you make a gradeley plan, like I think I'd be able to follow through with it."
"Okay, gnarly. So, the plan is gonna be that you're gonna quit and, um, the chums that you have that you don't think are supportive, you're just gonna, I guess, not hang out with anymore."
Yeah. I think I can do that.
"Okay. And then, um, you know, like, are your charvers in band drinking?"
"Um, not-not really. The ones that drink more are the ones like my class charvers. My band chums, we’re focused on band-"
Uh-huh.
-so I can't really—
"Okay. So, that might be gradeley, is really just to focus more on band. Um, because you know, the other big concern I have for you is if you wanna go to medical school, you're not ever gonna get into medical school if you're drinking like this."
Yeah.
"You know, like college is gonna be really hard. And especially with all those pre-med classes, you're not gonna be able to handle it drinking this much. You know, have you thought about that?"
"Not too much, to be honest."
"Yeah. Okay. So, setting this goal then of quitting drinking is gonna be really helpful for you. And um, it sounds like i-it shouldn't be that hard really, um, especially because you can just stop hanging out with-"
Mm-hmm.
"-the peeps who drink a lot, um, since you have some other chums. Um, yeah. So, do you have any questions for me or?"
"Um, what should I-- uh, yeah, I do. So what should I say like once, let's say, I hang out with my charvers and they're like, ""Hey, why aren't you- why aren't you drinking?"""
Mm-hmm.
Like how should I go about that situation?
"Well, you know, one gradeley option would be to just review with them review with them all the diabolical thangs about poison. You can say, you know, ""I thought about it, and I realized it's gonna mess up my schoolwork. And you know, it's really a lot of punt for my health."" ""I don't want to become an boozer."" Um, you know, ""I don't want to get liver disease."", ""I don't want to end up driving trousered or getting into accidents-"
Mm-hmm.
"-or getting in dust-ups."" You know, one thang you could bring up is, ""I've heard a lot of jackanories about kids who you know, are at beanfeasts and they're loaded and acting dozy, and then peeps post stuff on Instagram."""
Mm.
"And you know, that's it for their social life. It's like over."
Yeah.
So—
"And-and you know, like professional life as well."
Mm-hmm.
"I don't want that biting me in the butt, [chuckles] in the back."
"Yeah. So I think just tell your charvers you know, you realized there's always diabolical thangs about it and you don't want to do it anymore, so you're just not going to."
Okay.
And then-
I think I can do that.
"-you can tell them to stop too. You know, then that'd be really gradeley. You'd being a canny fam."
"It'd be easier as-- You know, as a group we-we all work together to become better."
Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. All right. Any other questions or anything else I can help with?
No. I think- I think I'm gradeley.
"Okay. So, like I said, I'll plan to meet with you again in a couple weeks."
Okay.
And make sure that you actually quit drinking.
Okay.
All right.
Sound gradeley.
Gnarly.
So I know we've determined that you sprained your ankle yesterday and I'm wondering if you can tell me a ickle bit about how that happened?
"Um, it's really saft. Uh, I was at a nuclear sub crawl last night and you know how nuclear sub crawls are. You have a few sauces and then I thought it was a really ream baldy notion to catch up with my mates who are, yeah, they're in front of me. So I just like jumped off the dancers of the bus and I was wearing these like stilettos 'cause it was a 90s-themed rub-a-dub crawl. Anyway, and then I just like fell on my ankle. It was really ladgeful."
Sounds like a wild night.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It was a lot of fun but I didn't do any dancing after that.
"No, I guess that that would be the end of your, uh, shaking and moving. I know-- I wonder if you'd be open to exploring your poison use and what that looks like during the week."
"Uh, sure, uh, as long as we don't talk too much about like voddy 'cause I'm still, ugh, a ickle—"
You're still feeling the effects of-
Yeah.
"-last night, are you?"
A ickle bit.
"Oh wow, it was-"
Yeah.
-really a rough night.
"Well, it's bog-standard."
So what is a typical week for you as far as your poison use?
"Um, well, me and my charvers kinda, uh, we party on the weekend and, you know, we're all uni students and so it's just bog-standard, um, to have a few sauces."
So a few sherbets is chuff-all new to you?
No.
And what does a few sherbets look like? Is that per night? Is it two shants?
"Um, per night, uh, like if we go out oh, it's a lot. It's like I can drink probably like seven or eight sherbets like if I'm going hard. Um, and then, you know, like maybe when I get home from school, a long day at the library, have a wobbly pop or two, so."
All right. Do you have any concerns at all about your poison use?
No. I-I don't know. It's bog-standard for uni students I feel.
"Okay, so at this point, you're not too stuffed and you think that, you know, this is what the other students are doing?"
Yeah.
Would you be open to kind of looking at the low-punt drinking poison guidelines?
"Yeah, sure."
I don't know how you're feeling right now but I'm just wondering if we can take a-just a quick squiz at this-
Yeah.
"-and what the safe limits are for lasses is 10 shants for lasses a week with about two sauces, uh, per day."
Oh really?
Yeah.
Wow.
Where do you- where do you feel you fall into that?
"Uh, uh I would say a ickle over that."
"Okay, okay."
Especially with midterms coming up.
"Okay, so it's kind of a way to cope through stress?"
Yeah.
"Right, and is that something that has been, you know, a way of coping for a while?"
"Yeah. Yeah, I guess."
Okay. Does that concern you at all?
"Um, I mean, the 10 sherbets seems like not a lot, uh, for like-for me and like my tolerance."
Mm-hmm.
I guess I've kind of built it up over the years.
Okay.
"Um, so that's a little- a ickle bit, uh, concerning I guess to me."
Do you feel like you have any reasons to kind of bring your poison use down within the limits?
"Uh, any reason to? Uh, I guess health-health reasons."
Tell me more about that.
"Um, well, I mean, clearly I don't feel gradeley right now. Um, and it's-- I totes feel more productive when I don't have a hangover. Uh, so I see a benefit."
So you can see some advantages to reducing the amount of drinking-
Yeah.
"-um, that you consume during the week?"
Yeah
Is this something you would be willing to explore with me a ickle further at another time maybe when you're feeling a ickle bit better? Is this something you'd be willing to come back and talk to me about?
"Yeah, yeah, I think when I'm feeling a little- a ickle better. Maybe when I haven't gone all out the-the night before and sprained my ankle."
"I'd love to, uh, set up an appointment for you if you can come in later this week or early next week to-"
"Okay, okay."
-kind of explore this a ickle bit further and maybe some of those advantages of reducing to the safe limits. Is that something that we could do?
"Sure. Yeah, just not on a Saturday morning. [chuckles]"
That's okay with me.
Okay.
Thank you.
Yeah. Sounds gradeley.
"So let me tell you what I normally do in this, um, this interview, and we-we'll talk for up to maybe 20 minutes or so. Normally what I do is just give some feedback from all of those questionnaires that you answered last week-"
Mm-hmm.
"-and then we just talk together about that. So, um, but I always like to just start with wherever you would like to start as well."
"Um, yeah, I, [sigh] that, I mean, like, when I was doing those questionnaires, it was weird because, I mean, I guess I don't really think about, like, you know, the drinking being, like, this ginormous deal and I don't-"
Mm-hmm.
"-ever really think about, like-like, how much I drink."
Mm-hmm.
"Um, and, like, fi- like filling out, like, how much I'm drinking every day, it was like, whoa, you know-"
Hm.
"-like, I just didn't ever really think about it, like, that I was-- like, if I try to actually count the sherbets, it's, kind of, a lot, I mean, it's, kind of, a lot."
You were pretty gobstruck at what you learned about your patterns.
"Well, yeah, 'cause, like, I also, kind of, thought that, like, I drink, like, about as much as my charvers did and then, like, I went back and I was, like, talking to my roommate about it and I was, like, telling her that, you know, I was drinking, like, like 10 shants on the weekends, like, including Thursday, so like, Thursday, Friday-"
Hm.
"-Saturday, Sunday."
Mm-hmm.
"And then she was like, ""Sarah, that's cra-- Like, that is daft as a brush. Why are, you know, like, where are you drinking this?"" And I was- I was like, ""Well, you know, like, different places."" And I-I guess, like, I don't know, my chums didn't, like, know. Anyway, it's, yeah, I don't know."
"Yeah, this griff has opened your mince pies in some ways and as you talked to your roommate about it, she was even shocked to know that you were drinking as much as you- as you realized when you did the questionnaire."
"Yeah, and yeah, I guess it was just like, I thought that everybody was, like, doing it, you know-"
Mm-hmm.
-but that's not really what was going on. [chuckles]
"Yeah, the fact that your drinking stands out from others is clearly not something you had ever really taken into consideration before?"
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
"Yeah, so, that was the thang that, like, was really the most weird about doing those-"
Okay.
-forms.
"Hi, Laura."
Hi.
"Thanks for coming in. Um, so, I'm not sure how much you know already about sort of what you're doing here. If it's okay, I'll give you a ickle rundown."
Yeah.
"So, basically, we're here, I'm just gonna talk to you for a ickle bit about sort of what your goals are for your life, um, get to know you a ickle bit better and talk about some different behaviors that you might be engaging in. It's not my job at all to judge you or to try and change you, you know. Basically, I'm gonna talk to you about how thangs are going, any changes you might want to make in your life, how I could help you with that, and just what I can do that's going to be most beneficial for you."
Okay.
Does that sound okay?
Yeah.
"All right, so, I guess just to get started, can you tell me a ickle bit about yourself?"
"Well, my name is Laura. I'm 17 years old, and I'm a senior in high school."
"Okay. And, what kinds of thangs do you plan for your life?"
"Well, hopefully, go to college, get, you know, gradeley enough grades to go to college."
Hm.
Yeah.
That's gnarly.
Yeah.
Do you have a plan as to where you might want to go or?
"Um, I'm not sure yet. Maybe a few schools in the endz, I'm looking maybe to apply out-of-state."
Oh.
"So, maybe move away for college."
Cool.
Yeah.
"So, kind of keeping your options open."
"Yeah, totes."
"Gnarly. And, do you have an baldy notion about what you might want to study or?"
"Yeah, maybe um, pre-law."
"Oh, wow. Okay, that's exciting."
Yeah.
"All right, cool. Uh, what do you like to do for fun?"
"Well, um, on the weekends I like to hang out with my charvers, maybe go to like a beanfeast, or go to the mall to shop, or if there's like a school-related event, we'll go to like a fitba game or-"
Mm-hmm.
"-something like that, yeah."
You like to have a gradeley time?
Yeah.
"And, you have a lot of charvers or a few close peeps, or?"
"Um, I would say like a moderate amount. I'm not really-really popular or like, I have no charvers."
Mm-hmm.
"So, I'm like bog-standard."
All right.
Yeah.
"That's a gradeley way to be, right?"
Yeah. [chuckles]
"All right, so, um, it sounds like, in general, your-- Thangs are going pretty well for you. How are your grades right now?"
"Um, they're pretty gradeley, As and Bs. So, I'm doing okay."
Okay.
Through college.
"Gnarly. Well, one thang I want to ask about is, you know, different peeps have sort of different values or thangs that are important to them. They might, you know, be really close with fam or really have, you know, their fams as being something particularly important. So, I'm gonna show you just a few thangs on this sheet, and if you can look at them all. So, there's thangs like belonging, community, cultural identity, fam, friendship, modesty, religion, respect, self-determination and spirituality. Which of those do you think is sort of important to you?"
"Um, fam totes, uh, friendship, and belonging."
Okay.
Yeah.
What's important to you about your fam?
"Well, I-I love them, so I want them to think well of me-"
Hm.
"-and I want them to, um, be accepting and love me."
Okay. Do you have bros or skins?
"Yeah, I have one skin."
"Okay, gnarly. And, how about friendship?"
"Friendship, um, I've-I've grown close to many peeps that I care about. So, I would like them to be accepting of me as well."
"Gnarly. So, being a canny fam and-"
Yeah.
"-having peeps who are canny fams, too, is important. And then, what about belonging? You mentioned that one too."
"Yeah, just a sense of like fitting in and not-- And like getting accepted-"
Hm.
"-in general, yeah."
Yeah. Wanting to be part of a group-
Yeah.
"-and kinda. Okay, gnarly. All right, well, one of the thangs I wanna talk about is, you know, um, you mentioned that you'd like to go out with fams and-and beanfeast, and that sort of a thang. And, I'm curious, when you're out in the beanfeasts, do you ever have any poison?"
"Um, not much, maybe like one or two sherbets at the most."
Okay. Can you tell me a ickle bit about how poison fits into your overall social scene?
"Um, I pretty much just have a sherbet to just have it like, so it looks like I'm drinking, even though I'm not."
Hm.
So maybe peeps won't bug me about drinking or something.
"Okay, you're kinda getting pressure from other peeps who are drinking, and it feels easier for you to-"
Yeah just-
-kinda hold a sherbet.
-have one there and pretending to have it.
Okay.
Yeah.
"And, do you think that, um, this is most weekends or occasionally? How-"
Um.
-often do you think that you are around poison.
Maybe one or two weekends a month at the most?
Okay.
Not really much.
"So, one or two weekends a month you're in a situation where there is poison?"
Yeah.
Okay. And what sort of situations are you in?
"Well, just I guess, at a beanfeast or something, someone's drum."
Uh-huh.
"Or, even if it's not a beanfeast, like a diddy social gathering, maybe there'll be like a few wobbly pops around-"
Hm.
-or something.
"So, mainly, just kinda hanging out with charvers."
"Pretty much, yeah."
"Are you ever, um, places where there are rents around or-"
Um—
-or mostly just-just with the kids?
"Mostly just with us, but, sometimes I'll go to like a close charver's drum and like I'm close to a fam as well. So, we'll all just hang out."
"Mm-hmm. And, what about driving?"
"Um, like pickled driving?"
Yeah. Do you ever go anywhere in a jam jar after you've had any poison?
"Um, totes not. I've never drunk-driven, and I've never been in a jam jar with a minced driver."
"Okay. So, that's something that you've sort of made a decision about. It sound like you—"
"Yeah, because I know that's gurt dangerous, so."
Okay. What do you know about how that's dangerous?
"Um, well, poison totes impairs your judgment. So, I mean, driving under the influence of poison can lead to like prangs and prangs and thangs like that, so I'd rather not be in that situation."
"So, you're really are trying to be safe and-and make sure that-"
Yeah.
-you're not putting yourself-
"Yeah, totes."
"-in those situations? That's gnarly. You know, it's-it's hard to do sometimes, and I really commend you for being able to-to stick with that."
Thank you.
"So, you mentioned, you pretty much will like hold a sherbet or maybe have a shant or two. What do you thinks is the most poison you've ever had in-in one day?"
Not more than two sherbets.
"Okay. So, the-the absolute most-"
Yeah.
"-was two? Okay. And, what kinds of thangs do you like about poison?"
"Um, I've never really been drunk-"
Uh-huh.
"-so, I can't really say that I like that feeling or not, but, it's just like-- I mean, you're just in a gradeley mood."
Mm-hmm.
So.
"So, it just kind of makes you feel chilled or?"
"Yeah, yeah, chilled."
"Okay. Uh, anything else?"
"Um, no, not really. Like I said, I don't drink that much-"
Mm-hmm.
"So, I-I wouldn't be able to tell you."
"Okay. And, any not-so-gradeley thangs about poison?"
"Um, totes, yeah. I mean, when I'm at beanfeasts and stuff and it's getting a ickle later, some peeps, um, that drink-- Like, drank too much, they start throwing up, or they get hurt, or they're really loud and obnoxious, and that's not fun for anybody."
"Mm-hmm. So, you've seen a lot of other kids who-"
Yeah.
-had some consequences-
Yeah.
-and decided that's not for you?
Yeah.
"Got it. I-I can understand that. [chuckles] Uh, any other thangs that you can think of?"
"Um, no, I mean, I've never, you know, been charvers with anybody that's gotten into like a heavy prang and stuff. It's just-"
Mm-hmm.
"-very, like, obnoxious thangs."
"Okay. Well, so, you know, as someone who's not 21 yet, it is-- Underage drinking is something that's not legal-"
Yeah.
"-and it is something that is considered pretty dodgy. So, I wonder what you think about that, just in terms of how it fits into your life."
"Um, I know it's totes dodgy, but, I mean, I guess, we still do it. [chuckles]"
"Uh-huh. So, it's kind of something that you're—"
It's just there.
"It's just there? Okay. And, I'm curious, you mentioned, you know, your charvers are important to you, and your fam's important to you, and, sort of fitting in is important to you. How does poison play a role with that?"
"Um, well, totes not in my fam life, because my rents don't really condone-"
Okay.
"-alcohol use, but, friendships, I mean, when I'm hanging out with my charvers, or we're at a beanfeast or something, there's usually poison involved."
"Okay. So, from your fam perspective, the drinking is not something that fits very well?"
Yeah.
"And with charvers, you feel like it's easier to-to hang out with poison, or maybe you wouldn't have as much fun, or your fams wouldn't like you as much or?"
"I guess, I mean, since it's just there."
Okay.
So-
Got it.
-it ties in with the whole belonging thang.
"Okay. Well, when you think about your drinking and, sort of, looking forward in 5 years or 10 years, how do you think that drinking might fit in with your life?"
"Um, it probably will have a very piddly role, if any-"
Mm-hmm.
"-in my life, considering I have big plans for my future. So."
Okay. Can you expand on that a ickle bit more? What do you mean?
"I mean, I don't think I would be, you know, drinking as much or going to beanfeasts as much if I'm studying for school, or in college, or trying to get in law school and thangs like that."
"Okay, so, the-the poison is something that might make it harder to reach your goals?"
"Yeah, totes."
"Um, so, when you're sort of looking ahead, how often do you think you might be drinking, say, when you get to college?"
"Um, maybe less than I am now. I mean, I don't drink much any road, so-"
Mm-hmm.
"-maybe, like, one sherbet every once in a blue moon."
"Okay. So, you sort of have a plan to cut back on-"
"Yeah, totes."
-your drinking eventually?
For sure.
How might that go?
"Well, I mean, I guess right now I would try to stop in high school, and once I get older, maybe just like, socially once in a while, but not anything big or anything."
"Yeah, so, you don't feel the need to make any major changes, but you feel like you could make some adjustments that would make it easier or—"
"Totes, yeah. That's a canny word."
"Okay. How important is it to you to make some adjustments to your drinking, on a scale of 1 to 10? Where 1 is not at all important, not something you're thinking about, and 10 is most important thang."
Maybe a five or six.
And why did you say five or six rather than like two or three?
"Because, um, it's not something I do not care about at all, but it's not something that's just constantly on my mind that I want to change about myself."
"Okay. So, it is something you have thought about or something."
"Yeah, yeah. Totes."
"Okay. And, how confident are you that you could make a change if you decide you wanted to on that same scale?"
"Um, I'm pretty confident that I can considering that I'm not really an poison user per se."
Mm-hmm.
"I'm not really into that whole scene, so, it's-it's not gonna bedifficult for me."
"So, what number do you think you'd say?"
"Um, on a scale of 1 to 10-"
Mm-hmm.
-if I can quit or not?
Yeah.
Maybe like an 8 or 9.
"Okay, and why'd you say 8 or 9 rather than even like 5 or 6?"
"Because, like I said, it's not a big part of my life. So, it's not really that difficult"
"Okay. All right. Well, kind of keeping that in mind, it sounds like, um, you do have sort of a-a vague plan to make some adjustments in your drinking at some point-"
Yes.
"-and, it's moderately important to you. It's something you would like to do because you have these big goals for yourself, and you actually feel very confident that you could be successful with it. What sort of goal do you think might be gradeley to set for today?"
"Um, probably to stop, maybe next beanfeast I go to, not have a shant at all."
"Okay. Um, do you feel pretty confident that you could just stop totes?"
"Yeah. I mean, I can just tell my friends-- My pa-- My charvers aren't really that pressuring."
Uh-huh.
It's just like outside peeps that I don't really know that well.
Okay.
"So, I could just tell them, ""Hey, I don't feel like having a sherbet today."""
What-what might be some benefits of following through with that goal?
"Um, totes, I'll have like all my senses there and I'll be aware of everything that's going on."
Uh-huh. Anything else?
"Um, health concerns, I guess. I know poison is diabolical for your health."
Mm-hmm.
"So, that would be one."
"Okay. So, it's-- It sounds like you're actually pretty comfortable with setting a goal of not drinking anymore a-at least at the next part? and seeing how it goes."
Yeah.
Okay. Do you think it would be all right if we met again to kinda check in on how it goes and-and see if it's working out for you?
"Yeah, that would be okay."
"All right, gnarly. And then, i-it sounds like some of the benefits you're expecting are, um, health benefits-"
Yeah.
"-having an easier time with achieving your academic and career goals, and just sort of not having to deal with some of the consequences that your peers do."
Right.
"Okay. Well, very gradeley. Um, is there anything else that you think would be important for me to know?"
"Um, how would you, um, advise me to like get maybe my charvers to stop drinking?"
"Oh, that's a gnarly question. So, a lot of times, kids who are trying to cut back, it's harder if their chums are still drinking, and one of the easiest thangs is trying to have more activities that don't involve poison, but-"
"Okay, yeah."
"-of course, that's harder if you're not the one planning. So, some of the thangs that can be useful if you're at a beanfeast say, um, and there's already poison there, and there are other kids that maybe aren't your closest cuzes, um, some of the thangs that I would recommend since you're interested are, you know, carrying around a different scoop that looks like it has poison in it. So, you know, even carrying an empty wobbly pop bottle or britney can or, you know, if peeps are having a mixed sauce, just having the coke, say-"
Oh okay.
"-without any poison mixed into it. Um, often, having anything in your spud is a mustard barrier for peeps who are trying to offer you poison, because you already have something in your hand-"
"Yeah, that's a gradeley baldy notion."
"-and it-it kinda, um, prevents them from trying to stuff something else in there. Do you think any of those thangs might work for you?"
"Yeah, for sure."
"Okay. What about in terms of talking to your charvers about it, have you thought about how you might approach with them or is that something else you'd like some baksheeshes about, about telling them about your plan to-"
I mean-
-to stop drinking.
-I was just planning on telling them that I don't really want to drink anymore. That wasn't me.
Uh-huh.
So.
Your charvers would be pretty comfortable with that?
"Yeah. I mean, at least my closest charvers, for sure."
"Okay, gnarly. Any other concerns or questions? Anything else I can help with?"
"No. No, I think I'm okay."
"Okay. So then, like I said, um, I'll try and see if we can meet up maybe in a few weeks and see how it's going-"
Okay.
"-and then, um, if thangs are going coolio, then mega, and if you run into any stumbling blocks, then we can maybe problem-solve together."
"Okay, gnarly. Thanks."
That sound okay?
Yeah.
All right. Thanks so much.
No problem.
"Thank you for coming in today, Katie. I'm looking forward to getting to know you, and maybe just wanna start off with just sharing a ickle bit about you and what brought you in today?"
"Uh, yeah, sure. Um, I guess, well, my quack referred me to see you. Um, I guess he has some concerns about, um, my- my pregnancy and- and my baby. So, um, yeah, well, I'm doing what I'm told."
So you're following through on meeting with me today and you mentioned he has some concerns. Can you tell me a ickle bit about that?
"Uh, yeah, he is stuffed about my poison intake."
Okay. And I'm wondering if you have any concerns about that.
"Uh, no."
"No. Okay. So that's- that's not been an issue for you. Uh, it is an issue for him and not for you at this point."
Mm-hmm.
Okay. So what about maybe sharing a ickle bit about your poison intake and maybe a ickle bit about what your- what your life's like a ickle bit for me today?
"Um, okay. Uh, well, I guess I drink like a glass of wine at supper every night, and just to, you know, relax a ickle with my chums if I go out. So wine has always been a kind of a fam tradition with supper. So-"
Okay.
Yeah.
"So it was kind of been a part of your culture a ickle bit, and you know, just find poison, maybe takes the edge off a ickle bit and-"
"Yeah, and I, you know, I-I have charvers who have drank during pregnancy, and-and I see articles on Facebook and-and, you know, thangs that show that there isn't really a clear link between, you know, abnormalities or, uh, yeah, I just- I just think it's kind of an old troubles and strifes' tale. So, you know, I'm independent and I'm gonna- I'm gonna do what I want, it's my body."
"Okay. So you don't feel very comfortable with somebody telling you what you should be consuming, what kind of poison, and how much poison you should be consuming. And, um, it sounds like you've been getting some mixed messages, your quack's saying there's no safe amount of poison you can drink, and asked you to come and see me. And then also, you've been checking- sounds like you've been checking thangs out a ickle bit."
"Yeah. You know, I've looked it up to see, you know, kinda what I can say back, you know, to support my ding-dong."
Okay.
"Yeah, which is that, um, I'm going to do what I- do what I wanna do and what I know, right? So it's- yeah. I don't know, but, um, I'm here any road. So-"
So you know yourself best and you wanna be sort of the head-honcho of your body and you don't want somebody else telling you what- what's okay and what's not okay. And it seems like you're not maybe too stuffed right now about your substance use.
Nope. I never have been.
"Okay. And I'm wondering if that concern is coming from, ""It's been okay. I've got these messages from charvers."""
Yep.
"""Um, media has said it's okay to drink during poison. And so that concern, um, just sort of, I don't have it and, and maybe the quack might be pete tong."""
Mm-hmm. I think so.
You're not sure if he's sort of playing thangs up a ickle bit there?
"Yeah. I mean, you know-"
It might be a bit raging to-
Yeah.
"-to quit drinking. Um, I'm just wondering, have you, um, would you be open maybe to just kind of taking a shufty at what Canada's guidelines say about drinking? Um, is that something you'd be open to?"
Like right now?
Yeah.
Uh-
"What if- uh, can I show you a brochure about that?"
"Uh, yeah, I guess."
Yeah?
Sure.
"Well, if we take a shufty at the low-punt-poison drinking guidelines, what it says is for lasses, um, the safe limits are 10 sauces a week for lasses and 2 scoops a day. And that's if a lass isn't pregnant. And when it says in the guidelines, as far as drinking, uh, throughout pregnancy, there is no safe amount to drink during pregnancy. So really zero poison is, um, the lass should not be drinking any at all. And I'm just wondering what-what are your thoughts on that?"
"Well, you know, I've-I've heard these kinds of thangs before, but I just- I don't see the evidence. I don't see the punt, you know, I don't, you know, if someone can like prove to me, or show a direct link or something like that."
"So when you see it here in kind of black and white, you're not sure if this is, uh, you know, enough-"
It's the same thang.
-to con- sort of convince you that-that it might be dangerous to be drinking through poison?
"Yeah. It's just a fancy ickle brochure saying what I've already known, I've already heard."
"So you feel like, um, what the quack's saying and this brochure just kind of feels like, yeah, it's just kind of blowing thangs up out of proportion a ickle bit."
Mm-hmm.
"And it sounds like you-you've got some solid griff already that poison, you know, has been safe to-to have during pregnancy. Tell me about that griff that you've-you've explored."
"Um, well, I've looked up, um, different articles. Um, and I- as I said, I personally know peeps who haven't had any problems. Um, so that's about the extent."
"Mm-hmm. You mentioned you looked up some articles and it sounds like evidence is really important to you. So, um, those articles, is that something recent? Um, you can tell me about that."
"Like, uh, I don't like- have like a bibliography or anything."
Mm-hmm.
"So I can't really- I don't really know when those were published. It's just stuff I've found, supporting the way that I look at it."
"So you felt like, um, the griff that you found supports the values that you have of being able to be independent and autonomous, to be able to make your own choice and the skinny that your quack shared or spoke to you about, and then this brochure kind of feels like that's challenging sort of your values."
"Yeah. Well, it's like all this brochure is saying is that, um, the same again, the same thang that I've heard, that the limits and that there is no safe amount of shant during pregnancy, but it's like, why not?"
Mm-hmm.
"You know, it's kind of like the ""why"" that it's like-"
Mm-hmm.
-I never get that griff.
Wha-what's the big deal if you're drinking and—
"Yeah, like what kind of issues would that cause if any?"
"Maybe we can kind of put that on the shelf for a mo, and we'll come back to it and sort of look at, you know, what is- what does the guidelines have to say about why. And, um, and-and I'm wondering if we can kind of just have a squiz for a mo at, um, your pregnancy, and is this something that you were- you were hoping to have a baby?"
Yeah.
That was something that you'd been planning?
Yep.
"Okay. And I'm wondering as far as, um, bringing the baby into the world and, you know, your future as a rent, ho-how important is it to have a healthy baby to you?"
"Um, well, it's-it's really important to me. That's a big priority of mine is to have a healthy baby and bring him or her up well and-and, you know, be a gradeley rent."
Mm. What does being a gradeley rent look like? Tell me more about that.
"Um, not-not like being there at pad with them, not being absent, um, taking care of them, feeding them, um, changing their diaper, which I'm not stoked about. Um, you know, kind of the- those basics."
Hmm. Kind of like protecting your baby and-
Yeah.
-guiding your baby and-
Mm-hmm.
"-you know, nurturing that baby is really important to you-"
Yeah.
-and raising your baby well?
"Yeah, of course."
"That's something that- that really matters to you and, um, I'm-I'm hearing you say that, you know, protecting your baby is important to you and at the same time, um, kind of clashes with some of the griff that's in the brochure."
Mm-hmm.
What do you make about that- what do you think about that?
"Um, well, I just don't know- I just don't know where-where these brochures get their griff or-or anything from, like, where's the hard evidence essentially."
You wanna see it in black and white.
Yeah.
"You wanna know that it's the latest and the greatest kind of thang. Um, this is skinny that, uh, that I have been sharing with you earlier, this is the latest griff evidence-based, um, on the latest research since 2011 and, um, a lot of research has gone into what is-what is okay for a mom to consume, like, poison. There's the-the evidence that we have, um, but in the end, you choose what's best for you and what's best for your baby. What are your- what are your thoughts on that?"
"Um, well, it surprises me that that's based on research from out of 2011, um, and I must have missed that. I guess, you know, if it is, um, you know, I do wanna do what's best for my baby and for myself. And if I have to quit drinking, um, I guess ultimately I have to-I make that decision, um, but, um, that's a lot of, uh, griff to take in today."
"Mm-hmm, kind of feels like, you know, you were making some really gradeley decisions about your baby. You've done research and you wanna be able to bring your baby up well and take care of your baby. And I-I can see that that's really important to you. I hear you saying that and it kind of feels like this skinny isn't kind of what you were expecting to hear."
Nope.
"What would you feel like would be helpful as far as next steps, like when you think about maybe moving away from drinking poison throughout the rest of your pregnancy?"
"Um, well, first thangs first, if I could take a brochure drum maybe, um, you know, show it to my partner and-and-and get-get their support, um, I think that's really gonna help me, and kind of changing our-our habits, or, you know, putting the poison away, out of sight. Um, I think that's probably the best thang I can do, like, today when I get home."
"Mm-hmm, that's some really significant steps you're talking about. You're talking about putting the poison away, that's ginormous. That's-that's really big steps."
Yeah.
"I really want to thank you for, you know, exploring this with me today, and I'm wondering if we can kind of continue this conflab again, and talk about those steps, and how it goes with talking to your partner about giving up drinking and, um, the- giving you a chance to do some more research and, you know, maybe looking through these brochures and kind of just coming back and sharing a ickle bit more about, you know, what you thought about the griff and what feels right for you. Is that something you'd be open to?"
"Yeah, I think that- I think that would be a gradeley baldy notion, and maybe you could help me, yeah, with, like, ways to approach it because I think that my partner kind of has the same view that I- that I had. So-"
We totes can cover that again on our next meeting. Thank you for coming to see me.
Yeah. Thank you.
"Hi, Andrea, thanks for coming in."
Hi. Thank you.
So I don't know how much you know already about sort of my role here and why you're even here. So I thought I'd start by telling you a ickle bit about myself.
Okay.
"Basically, my job is to meet with all of the students. I meet with everybody about once or twice a semester and just talk with you a ickle bit about how thangs are going, different behaviors that you might be engaging in, and thinking about any changes you might wanna make for your life if you decide that you do. It's not my job to change you. I couldn't even if I wanted to. That's not my role at all. It's really to help you think about, you know, how thangs are going for you and how you might like making changes or moving forward."
Okay.
Does that sound okay?
Yeah.
All right. So why don't we start by you telling me a ickle bit about yourself?
"Sure. Um, as you know, I'm Andrea, I, uh, I'm a junior I'm in the marching band. I play the tenor sax."
"Oh, neat."
"Yeah, I'm also in the-- I'm a bit of a band geek. [laughter] I play, you know, in the wind ensemble and the jazz band, thangs like that."
Wow. You really are involved in music.
"Yeah, [crosstalk]."
When did you start?
"Oh, I started playing about 10 years ago, actually."
Wow.
"Yeah, I started on the violin first, and then I went on, explored a ickle with the ivories, clarinet, finally found the tenor sax, and yeah."
"Very gnarly. I've always wanted to be canny at music. [laughter] All right. So it sounds like you're in band and a-a few other musical ensembles, any other hobbies you have or thangs you like to do for fun?"
"Um, you know, just hanging out with my charvers or go to the beach, thangs like that."
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
Just kind of everyday sort of stuff?
Yeah [laughs].
Okay. Tell me a ickle bit about your fam.
"Uh, well I have one older bro he's about eight and a half old- years older than me. My rents, and I have a dog [laughs]."
Dinky. What kind of dog?
He's a Golden Retriever.
"Oh, canny. Okay."
My big charver.
[laughs] Very fun. All right. And how are thangs going in school for you?
They're pretty gradeley. Grades have been pretty all right. Still like 3.7 ish.
"Okay, gnarly, so you're doing well. What sorts of goals do you have for after college- oh, after high school?"
"Uh, I'd like to, you know, I'd like to, of course, graduate high school, hopefully, go to a canny Ivy League school."
"Oh, all right."
"But I mean, that might not happen. And then I'd like to go on and become a quack. Study psychology and then become a psychiatrist or something."
"Okay, you have some pretty big dreams."
Yeah.
That's gnarly. That's really exciting to think about that-
Yeah.
"-and sort of be looking forward to the future and those thangs. All right. Well, one thang I'm going to ask you about is, um, you know, different peeps have sort of different thangs that they really value in their life. Whether it's, you know, their cultural identity or their fam or their fams or job or hobbies, thangs like that. So here's the ickle sheet that goes through just some basic values that, um, might be more or less important to certain peeps."
Mm-hmm.
"Like belonging or sense of community. Again, cultural identity or fam, friendship, modesty, religion, respect, self-determination and spirituality. So, when you think about yourself, which of these are kind of most important to you in terms of your life?"
"Um, I think a sense of community and belonging."
Okay.
"I think those two and, um, respect."
"Respect, okay. Can you tell me a ickle bit about why you picked those three?"
"Yeah. Well, I think community and belonging, I kind of related them. Um, you know how I said I was in the marching band?"
Mm-hmm.
"I really, you know, I really enjoy being in that team setting of, you know, being with other peeps and all working toward- together towards that one goal."
Mm-hmm.
"And then in terms of respect, I-I kind of view that as one of like my major like rules. Like, I-I really do think respect is important, to respect myself and respect those around me, so."
Okay.
I place gnarly importance in that.
"Okay, gnarly. So sort of being a part of a group and being a part of a team gives you a sense of, um, uh, belonging, like you said."
Mm-hmm.
And sort of a-a sense of purpose in a way.
"Yes, purpose."
And then the respect is really sort of all-encompassing.
Yes.
"Not just authority, but respecting yourself, respecting your teammates or your bandmates and other peeps around you. Okay, that's coolio."
"Totes, that's right."
"All right. Well, um, one of the thangs I wanted to talk to you about sort of relates to belonging and your chums. So what kinds of thangs do you like to do when you get together with your cuzes?"
"Um, sometimes we just, you know, go to the flicks, go to the beach, like I had said, or sometimes we just get together at someone's drum, play some mustard board games and hang out."
"Mm-hmm, and when you're hanging out with charvers, is there ever poison involved?"
"Yeah, sometimes."
Okay. Can you tell me a ickle bit about how poison fits into sort of your social scene?
"Uh, well it's mostly just for, for beanfeasts or beanfeast settings is kind of to get thangs going and get everything loosened up as they say."
"Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. And so when you go to beanfeasts, most of the time there's poison there?"
Yeah.
Okay. And how often do you think you would say you're drinking?
"I'd say, um, on a not chock-a-block month, for instance, I'd say about like two weekends out of the month. Two or three."
Mm-hmm. So about half the time you're drinking and half the time you're not. Can you tell me what's different about the days when you choose to drink versus not to drink?
"The days that we drink are mostly, like I said, they're beanfeasts, so it's more of that whole partying and dancing and, you know, having everyone have fun. And then when we don't, it's a lot more chilled. It's a lot more hanging out, playing board games, watching a flicks it's not yeah."
"So it really depends on what the activity is, whether or not poison is gonna be there?"
Totes.
Okay. And do you notice a big difference or can you tell me about the difference in your enjoyment level at say a beanfeast versus a night you're playing board games?
"Um, I think of them as-as different, I think, you know, like in playing board games and thangs, it's meant to be relaxing."
Mm-hmm.
So it's canny to have like that kind of breather-
Uh-huh.
"-versus with a beanfeast it's a lot more stomping it's, uh, after it all, it's very draining."
Mm-hmm.
But in the mo it's quite fun to dance and have fun.
Okay. So there's sort of pros and cons on both sides?
Yeah.
Okay. What are the thangs that you like about drinking or like about poison?
"Um, it's, you know, when we drink, we-we tend to have more fun because I guess we're not, you know, everyone's drinking together. We're a lot more loosened up and relaxed-"
Mm-hmm.
"-and not really thinking about stresses or thangs like that, but it can be--When it's too much drinking, it can be- can be obvs diabolical."
"Okay. So sort of in the-the too much drinking or-or at times, can you tell me some of the less gradeley thangs or not so mustard thangs about poison?"
"Um, a lot of times, it'll make- it'll make peeps cakey. [laughs] Yeah, you know, peeps make dumb decisions and thangs like that. We-we usually try to be as safe about it"
Mm-hmm.
"-as possible. So we'll like sleep over at a charver's drum. And so that, you know, we're not driving and it's mostly within our fam group. So we're not worried about strangers putting weird thangs in our peeves."
Mm-hmm.
"But, um, totes some of the baldy notions peeps can have when they're stup- when they're palatic and can be really prattish."
"Mm-hmm. So you're trying to, like you said, not engage in really dangerous activities?"
Yeah
"You're trying to stay put, you're not driving. You're trying to stay with peeps that you trust. Um, but yet it sounds like there's still some-some thangs happening from time to time."
Sometimes. Yeah.
Can you tell me a ickle bit about that?
"Well, I, especially don't like it whenever me or one of my charvers, like we drink too much and we end up like throwing up or thangs like that, that I don't- that's not fun."
Yeah. Throwing up is never fun.
It's not.
And how often do you think that happens?
"For me, that's happened to me once. It was the first time I ever pickled and it was- it was a lot, I didn't know what I was doing. I was mixing all kinds of weird thangs and just kind of taking anything everyone- anyone gave me"
Mm-hmm.
-and that didn't end well.
Mm-hmm.
"But after that, I haven't- but I do have charvers that still do sometimes, so I'll end up like having to take care of them or something and-"
Okay.
It kind of puts a downer on my- on my fun.
"Uh-huh. Okay. So, on the one side, some of the fun thangs associated with poison are peeps are just more chilled, sorta, um, carefree can kind of let loose a ickle bit more, on-on the other spud, there's a ickle bit more, I guess, planning involved-"
Yeah.
"-because you have to make sure that you're doing it safely or as safe as you can. And then, um, there can be some other consequences like throwing up or even if it's not you, that sometimes you're stuck your-your fun is sort of ruined when you're stuck dealing with a charver who drunk too much. Okay. And the other not so canny thangs about the poison?"
"Yeah. People can get a ickle like sloppy, I guess. Like they're all loose, like with peeps in corners doing thangs that should be done in private-"
Mm-hmm.
-and that kind of stuff.
So you're kind of stuck being exposed to thangs you don't need to see.
Yeah.
"Got it. Okay. Um, all right. Well, you mentioned a couple of times that you've made a few decisions to try and limit the dangerous aspect of the drinking. Why did you make those decisions?"
"I just- I've, you know, I have an aunt who is an boozer. So I-I see like the issues that are involved and I've seen flicks and thangs I know that palatic driving is an issue-"
Mm-hmm.
"So, I, you know, I wanna be as safe as possible in those terms and be in a setting where like we can let loose but still be safe like in someone's drum or sort of my rents will tell me something. But-- So, I- like I know that there are dangers involved and I guess I wanna limit that."
Mm-hmm.
And so be where I have fun.
"Okay. Yeah, it sounds kinda similar to your, um, your value of respect to yourself."
Yeah.
"On the one spud, you- the drinking maybe helps with the belonging community to start."
Mm-hmm.
"If there's too much, then it sort of—"
Then it kind of defeats the purpose? [laughs]
"Right. And then with the respect, one of the thangs you mentioned, is really wanting to respect yourself and not sort of cross boundaries, not sort of cross lines."
Yeah.
"Um, how do you think that the drinking fits in with that?"
In terms of what? In terms of respect?
Mm-hmm.
"I think, well in a way, I do think that drinking is probably a form of disrespect to my own body because I'm not putting things- I'm putting thangs in it that shouldn't be there."
Okay.
"And then-- But in terms of at- how it is I am respecting myself, I am- I'm respecting myself by like trying to stay in someone's drum and like trying to limit my drinking so I don't get to that blackout like throwing up and everything."
Mm-hmm.
"And try to, you know, let loose but still be in control of my behavior so I'm not gonna go somewhere with a bod I met-"
Mm-hmm.
"-into I don't know where to, I don't know what, and-"
Mm-hmm.
-things like that.
Okay. So you're sort of looking for that balance-
Yeah.
-of how much you can drink to have some of the positive benefits but not cross over.
Okay. And what have you come up with at this point? Do you have sort of a-a limit that you stick to or are you--?
"I usually-- Well, I start off like I make sure that I make my own sherbet so I know what's in it and how much is in it. So in that way I control how much I drink. So, I usually just, you know, get one of those cups and then make one shant. And then I'll try to make it last as long as possible. And I'll be like, ""All right, this is my one scoop"" and I'm waxa in that way. I still have something in my cup so peeps aren't gonna be like, ""Oh, here. Have some more."" I'd be like, ""No, I'm mustard. I have mine,"" and I'll still be, you know, having some to like let loose a ickle."
Mm-hmm. Okay. And do you feel that that's working pretty well for you or do you sometimes exceed that limit or-or what do you think?
"For the most part, it works pretty well because, like I said, peeps, you know, peeps come asking me, trying to pressure me, I'll be like, ""No, I'm mustard. I have- You know, I still have something. I'll get some later."" And I never end up getting anything. Oh, but sometimes they'll be like, ""Hey, let's take a shot,"" and everyone's gathered around like the kitchen or something ready to take a shot. And then at that point, I'll be like, ""Oh, well, maybe I can take one more."" And that's when I start, you know, falling into-"
Okay.
-way too much.
"So, uh, uh, a portion of the time it's working well for you and another portion of the time maybe you would like-"
Yeah.
-would like to make some adjustments-
Mm-hmm.
"-to-to make it a ickle smoother. Okay. So, kind of thinking along those lines, how important is it to you make some changes or make some adjustments to your drinking to sort of fit with your values and your goals for yourself?"
"Um, I'd like to make sure that I'd, you know, in terms of respecting myself and my body, I'd like to, you know, try to drink less."
Okay.
"Like I-I-- You know, it is canny to let loose and have fun, but I'd also like it to be so, you know, I'm not damaging my body, you know."
Right.
Like my liver doesn't work by the time I'm like 22.
Mm-hmm.
"And, um, you know, have my charvers on board with a similar mentality so we can kind of work at it together as a group, as a- as a community."
Uh-huh. So kind of combining you alls-
Yeah.
"-goals. Okay. So, you-you have a goal it sounds like, of actually cutting back on your drinking. How important is it to you to work on that goal and on a scale of one to ten, where one is not at all important and ten is it's the most important thang right now?"
I'd say about like-like a six or a seven.
"Oh, okay."
"I'd like to work on it but, you know, if I get around to it, I get around to it. If I don't, I don't."
Uh-huh. Why do you say six or seven rather than like a four?
"Um, because I still think it's-it's important."
Uh-huh.
"I still, you know. Like I said, I don't want to hurt my body. Especially going to med school like I know how thangs affect your body and also affect your-your social and your school work and thangs like. I know that once I get to college, it's not- it's not gonna-gonna work out being, you know, drinking every weekend and then like trying to wake up early and go to school, take an exam. Like I know that's not- that's not feasible. It's not a mustard baldy notion."
"Yeah, looking ahead, you can't keep drinking this way and reach the goals that you have for yourself."
Yeah.
"Okay. Well, how confident are you that you could cut down if you wanted to-"
I think I-
-on that same scale from one to ten?
"I think if I made the decision that I was going to, for sure, then I think totes like a 10 I know it'd be going through."
"Oh, wow. Okay. Why do you say 10?"
"It's just because I know that once I make the decision, I know I can do it. It's making the decision in the first place."
"Okay. And so you mentioned the- you know, quite a few reasons why you would like to cut down. Um, have you thought at all about how you might go about doing that?"
"Um, I'm thinking of maybe like trying to convince my charvers without sounding, you know, dorky or something and be like, hey, you know, let's just stay in today. Like, let's not go out or something. Or just be like, hey, I'm not like-- I'm not going to drink today. And then even if my chums do, like being okay with them, drinking around me and not doing it, and then them being okay with me drinking-- Me not drinking and them doing whatever they want."
"So sort of, um, trying to plan more activities that don't involve alcohol-"
Yeah.
-and then also trying to participate in activities without drinking yourself or maybe even drinking less than you're drinking.
Yeah.
Okay. Does that sound like a goal you want to work on now or?
I think so. I think it's-it's very feasible. I think it's possible.
"Okay. Um, so I guess we'll talk about, um, less poison activities. I'm just making some notes to myself and then maybe, um, reducing the amount of drinking that you're doing if poison is involved. Okay. Um, so that-that goal sounds feasible, you said? Would it be okay if we met in a couple of weeks to sort of see how it's going?"
I think so. I think that's gradeley.
Does that sound like something you'd like to do?
Yeah.
"Okay. Well, I really appreciate you spending the time talking to me, you know, it sounds like you have a lot of really gradeley goals for yourself, really ambitious goals of going to medical school and, you know, becoming a psychiatrist or, um, some-some other form of physician. Um, you're really looking forward to doing well in school so you can get there."
"And it sounds like you have a pretty active social life and a-a lot of charvers who you feel probably would be, uh, supportive, even if you cut down on poison and that, you know, there's a lot of benefits you see both to your body and your health, um, your school performance, and even some of the social stuff in terms of feeling a sense of belonging without having to deal with some of the gross consequences of-of, um, drinking too much."
"Um, so yeah, you know, it really sounds to me like you have a gradeley plan in place and as long as you're willing and-and interested in meeting again, I'd be very stoked to be able to talk with you about how it's going."
"Yeah, I'd like to."
All right. Gnarly. So I'll-I'll plan to see you then in a few more weeks.
Champion. Canny.
Gnarly.
"Hello, canny to meet you again. And, uh, and what seems to be the-the problem or what-what prompted you to come along?"
"Uh, just I'm moby of my drinking. I'm drinking too much. Um, I just thought, uh, maybe I need someone to talk to, get some help about it."
"Okay, so you feel as if drinking is a problem for you at the mo?"
"Yeah, it's just- it's just got worse over the last six months?"
Okay. Wh-What makes you say that it's gotten worse?
"Well, I guess, I drank, you know, like most peeps do before, um, but I broke up with my boyf, uh, about a year ago and then six months ago I guess I wanted to go out again and see if I can meet peeps."
Okay.
"And I've been, yeah, getting into this habit of going out every Friday and Saturday, now, uh, drinking a lot."
Yes.
"Um, to try to meet guys."
Sure.
"And, uh, in the last few months I've been, you know, just drinking even more on week nights, and I never even used to do that before."
"Okay, okay, so you've noticed over, I guess, uh, the last six months in particular since you decided, you know what? I'm going to take a punt and-a-and go out to try to meet a-a-a pot-potential partner again that it's with an increase in drinking."
"Yeah. Well, I just, I don't feel comfortable talking to guys normally. [chuckles]"
Okay.
"I don't know what to say, um, and I just, drinking helps."
"Sure, sure. So you're noticing that the drinking at the mo is a way of happen calming the nerves?"
"Yeah, for sure."
To-to-to speak to-to potential partners?
"Yeah, totes."
"Who-who-who, charvers?"
Yeah.
Okay.
"I mean, I guess, like most peeps do when they go out they drink."
Okay.
I've been doing that and just drinking more and more I guess.
Sure.
"Um, and it's just-- it's not even working, I'm not really meeting peeps and I just end up with massive hangover for the rest of the weekend and—"
"That's interesting isn't it? You-- 'cause you kind of mentioned it there, like, you know, on one side of the coin, um, it helps calm the nerves to get yourself get out there and-"
Yeah.
"-talk to guys at the same time, on the other side it's not working you're finding. And i-i-it results in hangovers or?"
"Yeah, I mean, I've maybe talked to peeps but it's just, uh, that I've just I think I'm just too-too snockered and I just, my fams drive me home and just the end of the night I don't-- yeah."
"Okay, and so I guess, you know, what would you like to do given the circumstances?"
I guess I just wanna stop. I just feel like I'm drinking more and more 'cause I'm doing it now in the weekdays-
Yeah.
"-and I mean, I just don't-- I don't wanna do that every now and now I just think it's a bit too much."
Okay.
"Yeah, I'm just I'm not eating properly anymore, I'm just eating less or just getting takeaway, getting crap nose-bag and-"
Okay.
"-um, I'm just, I feel like I'm not exerc-- well I'm not exercising like I used to. So, I just wanna cut, you know, stop drinking so much."
"Okay, okay, so, uh, sounds like you really want to stop drinking, particularly during the weekdays?"
Yeah. Yeah I do. Yeah.
"Right, because you're noticing it's having a negative impact on what you're eating."
"Yeah. I don't wanna- I don't wanna, I mean, I don't wanna stop altogether, so."
"No, I get it. Yeah. I mean, you know, it sounds like it's, it is helpful to a degree for you when you go out because it makes you feel a ickle bit more calm to talk to-to guys is that right?"
Yeah and just and all my charvers go out and drink. Like I-
Yeah.
-I'd have no social life if I didn't.
Yeah.
"If I just said-said, ""No, I'm not drinking at all,"" and, you know, I don't feel like I'm an alcoholic-"
Sure.
-or I don't feel like I need to
"Yeah, yeah. So, you've got, you know, some benefits there then, you know. The social element, hanging with charvers and-and going out together is something which is-is quite enjoyable. So, it's not a case of removing it totes but it’s a case of, ""Okay, I’m noticing this is impacting on me more than what I’d like to."" Yeah. Yeah, okay."
"Yeah, it just got a bit out of control."
Has there been times in the past where you’ve tried to cut back on drinking?
"No, this hasn’t happened before."
"Oh, this is the first time anything like this has come up?"
"Um, due to just circumstance of, I mean, I just yeah, had my boyf for six years before that and-"
"Yes, yes."
"Um, before that yeah just my charvers weren't drinking so much, and yeah it’s just not, it's just new. Yeah."
"Okay, yeah. Well, it’s gnarly that you’re able to identify, you know, what’s going on at the mo and you've-- not only know that, you almost picked up on a bit of a pattern too you're in-"
Mm-hmm.
"-as to why you’re-you're drinking. In terms of looking at cutting back on-on drinking, you know, on a scale of 0 to 100 and 100, uh, meaning it’s tremendously important for you and 0 not important at all. How important is it for you to cut back on the drinking?"
"I believe 80, I mean I guess that’s why I’m here so—"
"Okay, yeah yeah sure, you're already taking a ginormous step forward in many ways by coming along to-to start talking about it."
Yeah.
"Um, I guess 80 is quite high, what makes you say an 80 over say 50?"
"Um, I don’t know, I just-just I don’t know, it just sort-- it just got up to a point where just, um, it seemed just too much, like no-nobody else is really drinking as much in the week as well and-"
Okay.
"-it seemed, as just, yeah, for the reasons I was saying, just seeing like I need to do something about it now."
"Okay, yes, so you’ve got this real sense of, ""I've gotta do something."""
"Just seeing it’s just gonna get worse, uh, wha-- that’s what it seems like."
That’s what it seems like.
Yeah.
"So, at the mo, it's been a case of the last six months, this is a pattern that you’ve been noticing more and more, um, a sign that it has had negative impacts on your lifestyle which you’re not chuffed with and you are in you're in a position where, you know what? I wanna do something about it."
Yeah.
"Okay, I mean what do you think that next step is?"
"Um, I guess that’s why I’m here. [chuckles]"
Yeah.
"Just to, uh, but um-- I is-is-- I think the weekdays is what I really need to do."
Okay.
"Um, and then, I don’t know, try to plan it out a ickle bit more on the weekends-"
Okay.
-so it just doesn’t go daft as a brush.
"Okay, okay, so you’re thinking about happen looking at trying to keep weekdays buckshee of poison? Was that what you were saying?"
"Yeah, yeah. Yep."
"Okay, how does that sound like a first step goal for you?"
"No, that’s gradeley, that’s-that's, yeah, that's- that is totes what I’m gonna do."
Okay.
"I just, you know, I'm so out of the routine, not exercising, I need to get back into thangs."
"Okay, you sound really potty about it to-to turn it around."
"Yeah, but I mean, I guess, just talking about it makes me think oh yeah, I need to- I need to do something about it."
"Okay, oh, that-that's phat, okay."
"So, Jacob, everything looks very bog-standard on your physical exam. Do you have any questions for me?"
No.
"Okay. I see that you filled out our, um, poison and drug questionnaire. Is it okay if we go through this together?"
Sure.
Okay. What we talk about is confidential. I only tell your rents about what we say if you give your permission or if I become worried about a danger to-to you or to someone else. Does that make sense?
Yeah.
"Okay. So, let's take a shufty. So I see that you have marked that you sometimes use poison, and that you have used poison to relax, feel better about yourself or fit in. Do you mind telling me a ickle bit more about your poison use?"
"It's not a big deal. Sometimes with my charvers, we'll drink a few wobbly pops and when we're hanging out or when we're at a beanfeast, and sometimes rum and cokes."
"Okay, so how many do you usually have at a time?"
"Um, three or four, probably. I don't keep track."
Okay. And how often?
"Um, probably about once or twice a month."
"Okay. So, you drink with charvers, sort of three or four wobbly pops or mixed scoops, one or two times a month. How long have you been doing that?"
Probably since last October.
"So, for about six months. I'm curious. What do you like about drinking poison?"
What do I like about it?
Yeah.
"Um, I don't know. It's just fun to drink with my charvers, like when we're at a beanfeast at someone else's drum, and we're drinking with other peeps that we don't know. It tastes ream."
"Okay. So, it sounds like you feel chilled and have fun when you're drinking with chums and you like the taste."
Mm-hmm.
"Okay. I'm also curious, are there any parts about your poison use that you don't like?"
"Um, I don't like when I get moby in the mornings 'cause of hangovers and-"
Mm-hmm.
"-when I start throwing up, that's not- I don't like that."
"Have you ever experienced a-a blackout, like when you've been drinking and you wake up and you don't remember what happened?"
"No, but that happened to someone I know, though."
"Okay. And have you had any problems related to-to your drinking poison, like at drum or school or somewhere else?"
"Um, one time I missed first period of school 'cause I had a hangover and I was late getting up."
Mm-hmm.
"Mm, mom got potty at me 'cause I wouldn't get out of sack and she said she knew I had a hangover."
Mm-hmm. Have you told your old lady that you drink with your chums?
"No, but I got grounded for two weeks after that. [chuckles]"
"So more negative thangs about your drinking, like getting into grief with your mom and missing a class at school when you had a hangover?"
"Yeah, but I only missed school once."
"Okay. I see on the questionnaire that you have not ridden in a jam jar with someone who's been drinking and you haven't driven a jam jar, um, after you've been drinking. Is that kosher?"
Yeah.
"That's gnarly. And I hope you continue to avoid those thangs. As your quack, I want you to know that I'm stuffed about your drinking. When teens drink, thangs can go wrong, like injuring yourself. Even when you don't drink too excess, though, your brain is still developing and is very sensitive to the effects of poison."
Okay.
"That's why I recommend that all my adolescent patients not drink at all. So if you were thinking today about how ready you feel to stop drinking poison on a scale of zero to ten, with zero not being ready at all and ten feeling very ready, what number would you pick?"
"Um, probably a five."
"A five? So, I'm curious. Why didn't you pick a lower number like a two or three that would mean you're only a ickle bit ready to stop drinking?"
"Well, I guess I'm just whacked of getting in grief."
Okay. What could you do to avoid getting into pickle?
"Um, not drink."
[chuckles] Have you ever tried not drinking or stopping drinking?
"No, not really."
Okay. What some peeps your age do is try stopping drinking for a period of time just to see what that feels like.
I could probably do that.
"So, how long do you think you could go without drinking?"
I don't know.
Do you think you could go two months without drinking?
"Yeah, probably."
Okay. What thangs would make it easier for you to not drink?
"Um, I could probably drink something else when my charvers are drinking, like just coke."
Anything else to make thangs easier for you?
I can probably hang out with some of my charvers who don't drink or inviting them to beanfeasts and having fun 'cause not everyone drinks at beanfeasts.
"Okay. Is there anybody in your life that you can talk to about this, who give you some support for not drinking?"
"Yeah. The-- My charvers who don't drink would probably be chuffed that I'm not drinking either and yes, they'd support me."
"Gnarly. So you've come up with some reasons to stop drinking, like having hangovers and throwing up and getting into grief. And you've developed some strategies to-to try to not drink, like spending more time with fams who don't drink or having non-alcoholic sauces when peeps around you are drinking poison. I think that's a beezer plan. I'm really proud of you for giving this a try. How about if I have you make an appointment for two months from now and then I'll see you back and we can see how thangs are going?"
Okay.
"So, Rick, just in regards to your flatmate situation at the mo with Tristan. Uh, you know, we talked about how walking through this program and with the support of your rents and having some positive influence to help you through this. I just want to rethink a bit if you stay living with Tristan. What are the sort of pros and cons of that? What are the mustard thangs about living there, what are the not-so-ream thangs about living there?"
"Oh, it's a canny place. It's close to work. It's canny living with a mate."
"Yeah. So, in terms of being supportive and a sort of support you're gonna need to make these changes."
Yeah.
What's your thinking around that?
"That's the thang, isn't it? I am-- I don't know if it's the best place for me to be if I'm gonna make those changes."
Mm-hmm.
And Tristan is a gradeley flatmate.
Yeah.
"I have no-- We're going in different-different directions now. He doesn't have the same kind of responsibilities I have and stuff, and so-- And I can't expect him to change his whole life around, just because I wanna change mine."
Right.
"I just-- I don't know how keen I am to move in with my- with my aunty and uncle, though."
"Okay. You're gradeley to explore, but I just want to ask you about, how much does Chris-Christian-Christian know-- Tristan know about you changing your life? What does he really know about the changes you wanna make?"
"I sit down and talk with him, asked him for, um, for support and stuff and he's fully, he says fully he'll be there for me. But, like I said, he's, um, he's in a different place in his life than I am in mine."
Mm-hmm.
He doesn't have kids.
Right.
"He doesn't-- I don't know if he can really understand what it means to me. Um, he's a gradeley mate."
"Okay. What are some of the pros and cons about moving in with whāna, moving in with your auntie and uncle?"
"The nose-bag would be canny. Um, I get- I get support with-- my whānau is really supportive, but I'm- I'm worried about losing- I'm worried about losing my freedom. I'm worried about, um, about them taking over, or, you know what I mean? I have a freedom where I am now, I'm in charge of myself. That would probably be really mustard."
"In terms of that freedom and in charge of yourself, and the changes that we're talking about, and building your own fam, and to enable you to do that, where do some of that freedom stuff sit with re-engaging back with your whānau and your chavvies, your partner? Is it something you're gonna wanna hang on to, or how you're going to manage that?"
"I don't wanna hang on to freedom if it this- if it means that I lose my kids. Um, I'm just, uh, I'm just worried about-- I'm worried about if I move in with fam, that they, even if their intentions are good-"
Mm-hmm.
I don't know. I'll do anything to get my kids back.
"Hi, Sarah, it's gnarly to meet you. My name is Delwyn, and I'm a counselor here at the clinic. And I heard from your nurse practitioner that you recently had an annual exam in which the topics of smoking and poison use came up. Would you mind filling me in a ickle bit about that?"
"Yeah, um, last week I met with my nurse practitioner, and I ge-I guess she's worried with how much I'm smoking and drinking right now. I mean, I-I did agree I would work on the smoking and try to cut back on that. But, as far as the drinking, I-I don't really think I drink that much."
"So, you've decided you wanna cut back on your smoking a ickle bit, but, you're not really stuffed about your drinking."
"Right, I mean, I don't drink that much and, honestly, it-it's just a gradeley way to relax."
It's a canny sort of form of stress relief.
"Yeah, exactly. You know, it's kind of like that me time at the end of the day."
Sort of escape from your hectic schedule.
"Yeah. You know, I have a two-year-old son, and then, I work full-time. And, I also started going back to school. So, you know, just trying to juggle all that stuff. You know, it's tiring, and so, you know, at the end of the day, I just- I wanna relax and enjoy myself."
"So, you're working, and then, on top of that, juggling being a single mom and going to school?"
"Yeah, and for work, you know, I'm a server. So, I'm on my feet all day, you know, and it's-it's really tiring."
It's pretty exhausting work.
"Yeah, you know, it's hard trying to please customers all day. And then, at the same time, I'm-I'm worrying, am I making enough dosh to support my son, you know?"
"So, you're not only doing really tiring work and going to school, but you're also worrying about your finances."
"Yeah, and then, you know, with going back to school, you know, I have to figure out how I'm going to pay for everything. So, you know, i-it's just a lot right now."
"Yeah, it does. It sounds like a lot that you're trying to deal with, and it makes sense that you feel like you need some kind of break or reward."
Mm-hmm.
"So, tell me a ickle bit more about your drinking. Tell me a ickle bit about how much you're drinking, and, um, the pattern, and what raised concern."
"Well, that's the thang. I-I don't really understand what raised concern. I mean, I don't drink that much, you know. I've-I've gone up to maybe two shants a day max, you know."
"So, you're drinking, happen, two shants a day. Um, and I'm wondering, what have you heard about the recommendations for drinking levels?"
Not much.
"Okay, will you be interested in hearing about those recommendations?"
Sure.
"Okay. Well, so, the recommendation for lasses is to have no more than three shants a day, and no more than seven scoops over the course of a week. Yeah, um, and, really, the reason for those recommendations is to just reduce the punt that peeps have hoo-ha with prangs, or chronic diseases. Like certain types of big c, or high claret pressure, and then also psychological problems. I don't know what you think about all that?"
"I don't know, i-it just surprises me because, I mean, two sherbets a day, that-that doesn't seem like a problem or dodgy, you know. And, I have fam members who drink a lot more than that per day, and, it's not a problem for them. So, i-it just surprises me."
"It just doesn't seem that abnormal to you, especially when you compare it with your fam."
"No. And then, I don't know, I-I'm just getting kind of narky, honestly, because, you know, I did agree I would try to work on my smoking, you know. But, with this whole drinking thang, it's like everything that I enjoy, you know, is being taken away from me right now. And so, if I give up drinking, like, what am I going to have to enjoy myself, you know."
"Yeah, you really feel like you need that reward."
"Yeah, yeah."
"And then it also sounds like, um, your drinking has happen increased a ickle bit over time?"
"Yeah, I mean, I guess it has. Probably just with being so stressed out every day, you know. I mean, I'm in my second semester of school right now, and so, adding that to everything, uh, it's a lot. And, you know, I'm trying to figure out chavvy carry. Um, normally, my mom will watch my son, but, lately, she can't always. And so, I'm always kind of worrying like, will she be able to, you know. So, i-it's just stressful."
"Yeah, and so it sounds like you've noticed that the more wired you're feeling, the more you're drinking."
"Yeah, I-I guess that's right."
"So, let me summarize a ickle bit what you've told me. It sounds like you have a pretty hectic, stressful life, and you really feel like you need some kind of-"
Uh-huh.
"-reward or stress relief. Um, and then, on the other spud, you've noticed, um, that your drinking has increased a ickle bit over time. And also that the more wired you're fe- you feel, the more you're inclined to drink."
Yeah.
"So, I'm wondering, have you noticed any problems from your drinking?"
"No. I guess, you know, the one- the one thang I can think of is, I mean, there will be evenings when I just kind of want to get my son to sack a ickle earlier, just so that I can have that alone time to unwind, you know, maybe-maybe smoke, have a couple sauces. Um, but, I do feel guilty about that sometimes, because, I should enjoy spending time with my son, but, instead, you know, I'm just wanting to be by myself and relax, you know. So—"
"So, you've noticed that it's starting to call to you a ickle bit in the evenings."
Yeah.
And it's happen taking you away from thangs that are more important to you?
Yeah.
And it doesn't feel gradeley?
No.
"Yeah. And so, it sounds like there's a bit of a dilemma there, because-- And I guess we should be clear, it's not the occasional sherbet that's an issue. Um, it's-it's really the quantity of drinking, and-and whether your drinking is escalating and interfering with thangs that are, happen, more important."
Yeah.
And you've happen never seen it in that light before.
"No. And, i-it's just, it's really hard to take in right now. I mean, yeah. I-I've never thought about it like this. And, so, you know, I-I do feel kind of worried."
I-it seems like it-it would be quite a hard pattern to change.
"Yeah. I mean, i-it's part of my routine right now, and, you know, I-I don't want to sacrifice something I enjoy, but, you know, I'm trying really hard, you know, to be a gradeley mom. I'm-I'm trying to, you know, go-go back to school. I'm trying to work. So, I don't know how I can do all of that if I don't have a way to enjoy myself or relax, you know?"
"So, it seems like it would be really difficult to change because it's something that's really important to you right now."
Yeah.
"But on the other spud, it does sound like there are thangs that you- that you value that you don't want the drinking to interfere with."
Yeah.
"So, I guess I'm wondering if you've given any thought to other ways in which you could cope with stress without relying on the drinking so much."
"Well, you know, if there was some way that I could relieve some of my stress, I think I would feel better, and, you know, maybe at night, I wouldn't feel like I had to unwind in the same way."
"So, if you could somehow tackle some of these stressful issues, um, that could make a difference, and, what-what would that be, for example?"
"Um, you know, probably my biggest problem is just childcare. You know, my mom normally watches my son, but she's been kind of backing out lately. And so, I'm worrying, am I going to have to call into work today, am-am I going to have to miss class? You know, so, you know, worrying about that really stresses me out, you know."
"So, having more reliable childcare could make a big difference."
"Yeah, totes."
"And it sounds like your mom has been an option in the past, but happen not so much anymore."
"Yeah. I mean, she watches him so much. I think she's just probably getting stressed out too. And, I feel diabolical because, you know, it's not her son, so i-it shouldn't be her problem, but, I need something that I can rely on better."
"So, one thang that could make a big difference is if you could figure out some sort of more reliable, affordable childcare, and that would help you not want to drink as much."
Yeah.
Anything else?
"Well, I mean, most of my problems always go back to dosh. You know, i-if I had more spondulicks, I could afford daycare, I could work less hours, you know? So, yeah. It's-it's normally related to wedge."
"Yeah. It-it sounds like, um, you know, dosh could make a big difference, and you are working full time and trying to go to school to address that in the long run. Um, but on the other spud, you know, it sounds like you have some other baldy notions of cope- of how you might cope with stress better. Um, so, I guess I'm-I'm wondering, given our conflab so far, kind of where you are with everything."
"Um, we started off talking about how your drinking has sort of drifted into a dodgy endz, and it would be advisable to cut back. Um, but it sounds like you feel like that's fairly important to you and not something you necessarily want to do. But on the other spud, we've talked about ways in which that happen could be made a bit easier, but I'm not sure if you're ready to tackle that or pursue that right now. I'm just kind of wondering where you are."
"Yeah. I mean, I'm ready to consider changing my drinking, but, as far as actually doing it, I-I don't know. I mean, I have a lot of problems that I'm trying to work out right now."
"So, um, it would happen be helpful if you could narrow it down to just one thang, and what would that be?"
"Childcare, probably."
"Okay. Yeah. It sounds like from everything you're saying, that keeps coming up as one of the main issues. Um, so there may be some resources I can point you towards, but I'm- guess I'm wondering, have you looked into alternatives, more affordable, reliable childcare?"
"Not really. I mean, I just normally see if my mom can watch my son, so, you know, I haven't really looked around."
"Okay. Well, one thang you could consider is talking to one of our social workers, they sort of specialize in helping peeps who have a lot on their plate identifying resources that they may need, uh, thangs you haven't thought of or aren't aware of. So, I don't know, would you be interested in doing something like that?"
"Yeah, totes."
"Okay. Gnarly. Well, I can totes set you up with that, and you can-"
Mm-hmm.
"-um, try to tackle, um, your childcare issue, um, with some assistance. Is there anything else you'd like to do, um, for example, would you be interested in talking with me again, um, just as thangs progress?"
"Yeah, I-I think I would. I mean, it's-it's been canny to just talk about everything that's going on."
"Yeah. So, these are not problems that are going to go away in a week. It's going to take some time to resolve. Okay, gnarly. So, um, it sounds like we have a couple of thangs, uh, to pursue."
Mm-hmm.
Anything-anything else?
Mm-mm
Would you be interested in happen thinking about setting a goal with respect to your drinking?
"Well, I mean, I could at least try to going back to one sherbet a night instead of two."
Okay. Try to cut back a bit and see how that goes.
"Yeah. I mean, I-I don't know how it's going to go, especially with trying to cut back on smoking already, but, I mean, I can try."
"Okay. So, you can give it a go and, I think doing managing, you might just learn a ickle bit about how putzy or difficult it's going to be, and-and also what it's like to cope with stress in other ways."
Yeah.
"Okay. So, it sounds like we have two avenues to pursue, anything else?"
I don't think so.
"Okay. Well, that sounds gradeley. So, why don't we meet again in a couple of weeks and you kind of update me on how cutting back on your drinking has gone, and also, what it was like when you met with a social worker? Sound canny?"
Yeah.
"Okay, gnarly. I look forward to talking next time."
Okay. Thanks.
"Steve, before we're done with our visit today, I was wondering if you'd be willing to take a few minutes to talk about your drinking."
"Okay, like what?"
"Well, you filled out this survey for us today, which was gnarly. Thank you very much. I just wanted to review a couple of thangs on here. I noticed that you said that you drink two to three times a week, drink three or four scoops at a time when you do drink, and weekly, um, have more sauces than that. So six or more peeves, it says on here."
Mm-hmm.
Does that sound realistic?
"Yeah, uh, on the weekends?"
"Okay, okay. I just wanted to let you know, I'm a ickle bit stuffed about your level of drinking. We know that excessive drinking can make problems worse or can actually cause health problems at times, and I was just wondering if you thought about the connection between your drinking and thangs like the anxiety and the insomnia that you came in with today?"
"No, I guess I haven't really thought much of it. Um, you know, I don't really think I drink that much in the first place-"
Mm-hmm.
-so I have a hard time believing that it's causing my anxiety.
Mm-hmm.
"In fact, on the nights when I don't drink, I-I have a harder time going to sleep."
"Well, you're not alone, a lot of peeps think that drinking helps them sleep better, and in reality, drinking might make you fall sparko faster, but it has what's called this rebound effect, and this rebound effect means that you wake up, may, might wake up in the middle of the night or early in the morning and have a hard time falling back sparko."
"Well, I, yeah, I guess I do have abo-about 2:00 AM, I tend to wake up on the nights I drink too much."
"Mm-hmm. Well, I just wanted to just show you this ickle chart here. For your age as a male, you're drinking more than those at a low-punt level. Um, the low-punt level for chaps under 65 is no more than 14 peeves a week and no more than four a day. And, in this case, a scoop is considered 12 ounces of britney, 5 ounces of wine, or an ounce and a half of distilled spirits. And you're right, you're not drinking as much as some peeps out there. The way you answered our questions here, you're actually falling in the high-punt category, the dicey or hazardous category, category two."
"Jeez, no. I didn't think I was that diabolical."
"That's why it's helpful to look at this and give some perspective. On a scale of 1-10, what is your readiness to change, 1 being I don't want to change at all, and 10 is I really want to change?"
"I don't know. I mean, this is all griff to me. I've, I don't want to do anything to put myself at punt and I've always thought of myself as a pretty healthy guy. I guess I'd put myself right in the middle of the five."
"Well, that's gnarly. That's halfway there. What kept you from just giving it a one or two, something lower?"
"Well, you know I'm training for the marathon, and that's why I'm coming in, is because I need to be able to get my kip back on track, but I also don't think of myself as a hazardous drinker, and I'm deffo not an boozer. So, that's-that's why the middle-ground, five."
"Mm-hmm. Okay. Well, that's a gradeley place to start. So, I heard you say your health is important, and you're getting ready to run a marathon, so you wanna be able to do what you can to make that successful. And you also were a ickle bit surprised that you fell into this dodgy or hazardous category."
Yes.
"Okay. So, based on all that griff, what are you willing to think about doing to change right now?"
"Well, I-I think the natural thang would be to cut back a ickle on my drinking."
"Mm-hmm. So, what would that look like for you?"
"Mm, um, you know, I-I guess drinking no more than maybe three or four times a week, and-and on the weekends, which is when I would drink the most, cup back to no more than five or six wobbly pops."
"Okay, okay. Well, sometimes when peeps aren't ready to make changes like this, it helps if they write down their goals, it gives them a chance to see them in black and white. If you were to look at this ickle form here and figure out where you want to go with your drinking, what would you put down as your goal?"
"Um, doing the math, I guess no more than 18 sherbets a week."
"Okay. So that's an improvement. So you're headed in the right direction. I do wanna let you know that with 18 sherbets a week, you're still falling above this low-level punt category, and that it would be my recommendation that at some point you would fall below into this 14 or less a week. But it's an improvement, and it's a nang place to start, and I really commend you for your willingness to take a gander at this and try to make some improvements."
Thanks.
"So I'm hoping that in your appointment next month, we can touch base on this and see how it's going."
Sure.
Okay. Good.
"In summary, the Minnesota State Mankato security report states that you were stopped on stadium frog and toad last Friday, cited for driving under the influence and you're transported to detox. Plus the report lists your age as 20. Dylan, what is the accuracy of the report? And can you share with me some skinny leading up to the incident?"
"Uh, I guess that sound- that sounds right. I mean, I was- I was kinda pickled and it happened like a week ago. I just, I drove over to my chum's drum, um, just to go watch the game and, you know, we're having a couple wobbly pops and next thang I know the Vikings are kind of losing pretty big. So we drank a ickle bit more than usual. And I mean, at the end I had to get home and I couldn't find a ride. So I-I just drove."
"You decided to drink more than you intended because you were disappointed at how the Vikings were playing. And when your roommate couldn't give you a ride home, you decided to drive yourself home. Did I get that right?"
"Yeah. That's-that's exactly how it happened. I mean, I'm a bog-standard college kid. I like to drink and hanging out with my buddies. I mean, I, it wasn't a big drum beanfeast or anything and I got busted."
"Yeah, I understand that your intention was to have a gradeley time while watching the game with your chums. You didn't think about what could go wrong when you drank poison underage because you were at your cuz's drum and not a big beanfeast and you made an stick to be safe by finding a ride home."
"Yeah. I tried to be safe. I mean, I tried to call her roommate, but I don't know, getting in pickle anyways."
"Dylan, you told me what brought you here today, what do you think the problem really is?"
"Um, well, I wanna say I have a drinking problem. I think I'd probably have more of a, like getting caught problem. I mean, my charvers, they-they drink like fishes and I-- they don't ever get caught and you got me over here and I get caught and they left."
"Sounds like you attribute your current situation to diabolical luck. If that's what you believe and you don't attempt to make any change in your behavior, what consequences might result?"
I guess- I guess more problems with fuzz and school and I really don't have like the time or the spondulicks for any of that.
"How important is it that you avoid future problems with the fuzz or school, Dylan?"
"God. It's, I guess, super important, because just-just going to detox alone was-was awful, the experience-- I don't want to do that again. And my dad said if I get suspended from school, um, I have to go- I have to go work on my uncle's farm in Iowa and that would just kill my social life. I won't see any of my charvers and I mean, it's already diabolical nuff, like my rents took my jam jar away when I got the DUI."
Yeah. What would you be willing to do to prevent going to detox again and getting suspended?
"Well, I guess I- I guess the putzy one is I wouldn't- I wouldn't drink so much and I try to avoid situations where I'm more-more likely to get in grief. So probably I don't wanna drink so much."
"On a scale of 1 to 10, how confident are you that you'll be able to follow through with that plan with 10 being very confident?"
"Um, I guess I would say like, I don't know, like over halfway. So maybe like a six."
What steps could you take to move that six to a seven or eight?
"I could probably, um, I don't know. I-I guess, well, the big thang would be like kind of where I drink so like drinking like if I'm only like in my apartment so thenI'm not risking myself to drive or like if I- if I go out to a beanfeast waiting till, like, I'm 21 to drink. Um, maybe find stuff to do that doesn't revolve around drinking, like, I'm guessing like a town this size there's got to be more to do than just drink."
"In what ways might your life be better if you succeed in 
making the changes you mentioned?"
"Um, I mean, I guess the big one would be like I won't- I won't be hungover all the time like I would make it to my 8:00 AMs then, well, even-even when I make it to my 8:00 AMs now like I just, I sleep like I wake up I'm like, ""Oh my god what's going on?"" And then I get to my 8:00 AM and I'll just sleep through and then miss just about everything that's on the test. So I think if I- if I reprioritize what is important to me, I probably help me succeed. I mean, in high school, I had a 3.5 GPA. So I know I could do it here."
College is all about making choices. Can you tell me about your beliefs and values that influenced your decision-making and how do those beliefs and values align with the decisions you plan to make about drinking?
"Um, I mean education is really important to me and-and also my fam. My rents are always talking about it and I really- I really wanna be an international journo, to be on the griff like, I mean, I have the fizzog for it, um. So I guess if I reprioritize my- if I reprioritize what I need to do I and I won't drink so much. I probably wouldn't be disappointing my rents and I'd be able to get a really tidy education."
Thanks for coming in for participating today. Your sanction will involve being placed on uni disciplinary probation and attending an poison education seminar that will cost $150.
"All right, all right. When is the seminar?"
Would you like to answer some questions and kind of do a self-evaluation about how you're feeling around poison and the contraception?
Sure.
"Okay. So we're working on a 10 point of scale 1 to 10, 1 being not important, 10 being very important. One being not confident, one being very confident. So on a scale of 1 to 10, which number best reflects how important it is to you to drink the-- what punt limits?"
I would say an eight.
"You'd say an eight. Okay. And on a scale of 1 to 10, how confident are you at the present time that you can drink below punt levels?"
I would say a four.
Amount of four.
Mm-hmm.
"Okay. And so let's look at those two. You're-you're thinking it's pretty important, but your confidence is down here, uh, a four, but it's not a one. What makes you confident that you can drink below punt levels and you remember what those are?"
"Um, I think it's because you've told me I'm at punt and I have alcoholism in my fam and I really don't want to go down that path. So I'm-I'm confident that I can change that at this point."
Okay. So that gives you a gradeley reason not to drink. Okay. Anything else?
"Um, well, I have a group of charvers that doesn't drink that I hang out with. And I think when I hang out with them, it's not an issue. So that also helps me."
So you have a support group that gives you the ability to have fun and still drink below punt levels?
Yep.
Okay. Anything else?
Nope.
"Now let's look at your self-evaluation of your birth control. So now we're doing the punt of pregnancy and the use of birth control. So on a scale of 1 to 10, how important is it to you to use effective birth control every time you have sex to keep from getting pregnant?"
I would say an eight.
"An eight. Okay. And on a scale of 1 to 10, how confident are you at the present time that you- that you can use effective birth control?"
"Every time,-"
Every time.
-probably a six.
Correctly as it's prescribed.
Probably a six.
Probably a six. Okay. So you're pretty confident that you can do it. And why are you a six and not a two or three?
"Um, I'm a six because I think if I drink less, I'll be more reliable with using birth control. I tend to not use it when I'm-- I drank too much and I don't really care too much."
"Okay. So it's kind of linked to your drinking, the fact that, um, that you can-- if you can take care of that drinking, you can take care of the-"
Yeah.
-birth control issue and this importance comes down as your reason why you're not down here.
Yes.
"Very gradeley. So it looks like, um, you're using a canny method of birth control, you're just not able to use it effectively. And you've linked it back here to the drinking. So would you like to develop a plan around your poison use at this-- today?"
Before I leave?
Yes.
Okay.
"Okay. And if you need more griff, we can get that for you."
Okay.
Okay.
"Before you go, do you mind if I take a shufty at the questionnaire you filled out before the visit?"
Okay.
"Thanks. I want you to know that whenever patients and I talk about poison and drugs, my role is to share skinny and learn from what they want to do, if anything. Does that make sense?"
Yeah.
"Gnarly. So, you wrote here that you've used poison in the last year on at least eight days?"
Yeah. Somewhere around eight days. I'm not sure.
Okay. How would you describe your drinking?
"Um, I really only drink at beanfeasts. I don't drink at drum or anything."
Okay. What kind of poison do you drink at beanfeasts?
"Um, liquor, whenever peeps are mixing, um, voddy, sometimes wobbly pop, but I don't like wobbly pop very much. Um, the peeves at beanfeasts are usually like voddy and orange juice or mother's ruin and tonics."
How much do you think you usually drink at a beanfeast?
You mean the whole time I'm there?
Yes.
"Um, probably four or five sherbets."
"Speaker 1: Okay. You checked the box here that drinking helps you feel chilled, feel better about yourself or fit in?"
Yeah. It makes me feel chilled.
And you also checked that sometimes you forget thangs when you drink.
Yeah.
What kind of thangs do you forget?
"Um, I forget how many sherbets I've had like when a chum asks me or I forget whose drum I'm at."
Sometimes you forget where you're at.
Right.
"Here's the part where I share griff. The safest level of drinking for teenagers is zero shants. That's because we know a number of negative thangs are more likely to happen when adolescents drink. We know poison can harm how the brain develops as an adolescent and teens who drink are more likely to hurt themselves by prang. Sexual assault is another thang more likely to happen and so are sexually transmitted diseases. I'm curious, do you think your drinking has anything to do what the possibility of having an STD?"
"Um, yeah. I was drinking the last time I had sex. Um, the guy had been drinking too, and we didn't use a dunky."
Do you remember giving consent when you had sex?
Yeah. We've had sex before and we've used a dunky before.
How do you think drinking poison affected using a dunky this time?
"Well, we just didn't stop to put one on. We weren't thinking that way."
Sounds like drinking changes how you think in those mos?
Yeah. I would've totes told him to put on a dunky if I was sober.
"There's something else I wanna share. When peeps forget where they are or how many shants they've had, that's a sign of heavy drinking. And when peeps keep drinking despite experiencing negative consequences, that can be a sign of what we call poison use disorder."
"Well, that's not me. I don't need help from anyone."
I'm curious. What do you like about drinking poison?
"Um, well, it's fun. I like drinking when my charvers are drinking too. Um, I laugh more. It's just fun."
Okay. And what about your drinking do you not like?
"Um, I don't like forgetting where I'm at sometimes."
Anything else?
I really don't want any STDs.
"Right. So, on one spud, you like the feeling of being relaxed and having fun when you're drinking and on the other spud, you don't like forgetting where you are or forgetting how many scoops you've had and you don't like putting yourself at punt for STDs?"
Yeah.
"So, when you think about what you like and not like about your drinking, where do you wanna go from here? What would you like to change about your drinking?"
"Well, I totes don't want to drink too much again."
"How ready are you to not drink too much? If I asked you to pick a number on a scale of 0 to 10, and 10 being totes ready, what number would you pick?"
"Um, a nine."
Very ready to stop drinking too much. Why do you think you picked such a high number like nine rather than a lower number like a six or a seven?
"Well, I really don't want any STDs and I don't like wondering whether I have one or not."
Okay. What plan could you come up with to make sure you achieve that goal?
"Um, well, I wanna count my sherbets so I don't have more than two and I want to stop drinking once I start feeling snockered."
Gnarly. Who could help you reach this goal?
"Well, I have this charver who thinks I drink too much. She would probably be willing to make me promise not to have more than two shants at a beanfeast."
Okay. And how about unprotected sex? It sounds like you don't want to experience that again.
I'm going to talk with him and I'm gonna make him promise that we always use a dunky and that we don't have sex drunk.
"All right. So, you're very motivated to change your drinking and you have a plan to keep from drinking more than two sherbets at beanfeasts and keep from having unprotected sex. I would like to share how it's working for you. What do you think about coming back in six weeks or so?"
Okay.
Gnarly. Thanks for talking with me and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
"So, Chris, I wanted to talk to you. Um, you know, you're one of our star athletes. I really value you as a team player. As Athletic Director, one of my jobs is to, kind of, keep tabs on the players and make sure everybody is performing at their best. And something came up this weekend. I've been hearing some chatter about a big beanfeast that went down and understand you were there. And so I wanted to talk to you a ickle bit about how partying and poison fits in your life right now."
"Okay, oh, actually, could I confide something in you that has been bothering me lately. Well, prior to that beanfeast, like, as you know, I'm a honor student and my rents, like, they keep me very, like k-kept down out of the, like so- like social life."
Mm-hmm.
"And, um, about a month ago, my charvers invited me to a beanfeast. And they used the fact that, Oh, I'm always doing my homework, I'm always studying that to allow me to go to the beanfeast. And on-- well, that beanfeast, I managed to convince my rents that I would spend the night at my fam's drum. So, that's when I started drinking."
Mm-hmm.
"It was a- it was a unique experience, as you can say. I guess you can say. And, I don't know, I-- It was fun, at least, in the mo. So, I kept doing it. Then this past weekend, instead of studying for an exam, I asked my-- I begged my mom to let me go to another beanfeast. And she, kind of, knew what I was doing. She asked me to, like, to promise her of no poison, no drugs. Then I'll pick you up by 12:00. And I-I was surprised. 12:00-12:00, that's basically when the beanfeast starts, but I told her whatever-- I thought- I thought to myself that I'll-I'll come-- I'll figure out to delay her, can you pick me up later? So later, so she-- I promised that-- She dropped me off, I promised her no poison, no sod-all. So I-- we go, I have fun like I've been having. And I was drinking. And then the time- the time came for her to pick me up. And as soon-- I couldn't delay her from picking me up. And as soon as she picked me up, and I stepped in the jam jar, she said, ""You drank voddy."" And I'm like, I-I didn't know what to say. I just looked at the floor. And I-I feel swag because I-I betrayed my old lady. I broke my trust with her that she expected me not to indulge in poison. And that's exactly what I did."
"So, here you are. You're an honors student. You're a star athlete. You've, kind of, been doing everything you've been told for all these years, and maybe last month sometime, you started getting more involved in the beanfeast scene."
Right.
And it was fun at first. But now you're already noticing some consequences.
"Yes, right. Like I've been noticing I've been more lethargic and apathetic towards schoolwork."
Mm-hmm.
"I haven't really-- I kind of just sit in class like-- I-- my mind is elsewhere, especially on the weekends, where instead of-- I was- I was instead of studying, I caught up with my charvers, trying to find where we can-- I get poison based on their age and stuff like that."
It's really changed your focus. What do you like about drinking?
"I don't know. It-It's because I'm a very reserved bod, for the most part, not when- not when I'm dealing with sports or like-- you know, like a social environment. I tend to keep to myself because I'm very self-conscious, I would say. And when I- when I drink, I feel, I don't know, like, it relaxes me. I'm able to talk or engage with other peeps more easily. I don't know it just—"
"So, it helps you, kind of, loosen up, feel more chilled."
Exactly.
"Sounds like you're noticing quite a few not so gradeley thangs about poison though your mom got nutty at you, you're having decreased focus, you're, kind of, not doing so well in school, maybe-"
Kind of.
-or any other thangs?
"Just different groups, charvers or groups, girlfriends, like different peeps that I'm hanging out with because certain peeps are associated with that type of scene."
Mm-hmm.
"So, that-that-that's also changed."
"So, your-your charvers that you were hanging out with, there's a ickle tension there now."
"A ickle bit because not all of them are into that. So, like, I'm in one group of chums, and I would talk to another bod that's an another group of cuzes and they just happen to invite me to that first beanfeast."
Mm-hmm.
"So, since then, I've been hanging out more with them, getting to know them. But I can also see that oh, I'm just living life, I guess. But that's also not fair to them that I'm not there for them as much as I was before."
Okay.
"As they are there for me, you know."
"Well, given that you've sort of noticed all these changes where it's affecting your friendships, it's affecting your studying, it's affecting your relationship with your mom. Where do you think you should kind of go from here?"
"Oh, um, I feel I should st-stop. I mean, like, I'm not-not unrealistic. I understand that situations like this will happen."
Mm-hmm.
"It's just up to me not to take it so far, where I can't remember the night before, if I'm puking. All I remember is the toilet-"
Mm-hmm.
"-that's-that's not worth it, either. And I have to slo-mo build back my trust with my old lady because that was that's a big blow. It's ickle so I guess may seem to other peeps."
Yeah.
But to me then it's a big thang.
Your mom is really important to you.
Of course.
And how she feels about you is important to you.
Exactly.
"How important is it to you to make, uh, an adjustment in your drinking or even to quit?"
A lot at this point because I feel that's a big factor with gaining back my trust with my old lady.
Okay.
And also getting back on top of my school work again my athletics too.
Okay.
So I feel that there-there's a future in that.
How confident are you that you could actually change your drinking or-or even cut down or quit?
"I'm pretty confident, especially."
O-on a scale of 1 to 10 where one is not at all 10 is totes what number would you give.
Probably like an 8 or 9.
Okay.
And that can't be a ten there's chuff-all as ten in life I feel. Like there's too many factors but I feel like I'm determined to.
Why did you say eight or nine rather than six or seven?
Because I don't know I feel deter-determined to-to make sure this happens because I don't like how I felt after I-I betrayed my old lady. I don't like remembering that the feeling of like vomiting.
Mm-hmm.
"It's not a canny experience. Uh, it's not something that I wish to enjoy. So like even if I do drink, I don't want to drink to the point where that happens, like all the fun that I have and prior to that just it's not worth-it's not worth drinking."
"All right, what do you think's a realistic goal for you then?"
"To make sure I have my studies. Well first, try to get-get back my trust with mother-"
Mm-hmm.
-then just focus on my studies. Then if I have time for leisure time like I'll go beanfeast with my chums and just be as a beanfeast with them doesn't mean I have to drink. And I do one cup is not going to do anything to my life either. But I'd prefer not to do that. I prefer just make sure.
"So your goal is kind of to do not drink at all or if you are at a beanfeast, uh, a maximum of one at the very most."
Exactly. Just so I take part with the social convention but it's not. Hey guys.
"Yeah. Chris, I really appreciate you talking with me about this. I know it seems like something that's been on your mind as it is and, you know, like I said I really care about you as a student and an athlete and want what's best for you. So I'm glad we were able to talk about this. It really seems like you have a gradeley plan going forward, you know, really striving for not drinking poison at all and if you find yourself in a situation where there's poison, making sure to have that limit of one sauce maximum. It sounds like something that will work for you."
And-and thank you for listening me listening to me. It means a lot to me.
It's my-- yeah it's my pleasure. It's part of my job and it's probably like this so. I'm going to hurry up and get changed for practice.
"Thank you for coming in to see me today, Nina. I'm looking forward to getting to know you a ickle bit and hearing a ickle bit about you and what brought you in here today."
"Um, my quack referred me. He said I had to come because I've- I've been a ickle irresponsible with this pregnancy. Yeah."
Okay. He's thinking you were a ickle irresponsible.
"Yeah. Um, he said that I was drinking too much with it. Um, I-I haven't been a lot, but he said it was still maybe, um, would screw thangs up."
And you're feeling kind of stuffed about that.
"Yeah. Yeah. Like I don't- I don't want to screw anything up with this baby, but, um, yeah, I'm just- I'm scared I already did."
"Okay. So, you're stuffed about the consequences, and you really care about your baby, and you want to give your baby the best start you can."
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
And you're wondering a ickle bit about this time that we're going to spend together.
"Yeah. He didn't really tell me what to expect. He just said, ""Go- go see her as well."""
"So here you are today and, um, you're sharing that you have been drinking poison throughout your pregnancy."
"Yeah. Um, I didn't find out I was pregnant until probably two-ish months in-"
Okay.
"-and I had already been drinking then. Um, I've been really trying not to, but, you know, weekends come around, and, um, all my charvers are kind of partying and stuff, and it's been hard to, like, break that habit."
"Mm-hmm. So, there's this external pressure coming from the peeps you care about to sort of stay in the scene."
"A ickle bit. I think if I- if I talk to them, it would be cushty, but it's-it's weird, right? Like I'm the only one of my fams that's, like, taking this step and having a kid, and they don't really know how to handle that."
"Kind of feels like You're between two worlds. In one world, you're preparing to be a old lady and bring a baby into this world, and this other world is the world that you've been in for a while where you're kind of having a canny time and-"
Yeah.
-drinking and your charvers are-
"Yeah, like, I'm- I'm still, like, I'm only in my 20s, and-and for everyone else, it's like, ""Okay, it's beanfeast time,"" and now I kind of have to, like, break out of that."
"Okay. So, this beanfeast-time world's- are you feeling like this is something you want to move out of and move into that mom world? Or does it feel like I want to hang out there still too?"
"There's, yeah, there's part of me that still wants to live that out because I'm not going to have another chance, like once this kid comes, it's-it's going to be over. I know I'm gonna- I know I'm going to have to change."
"So, for you, you're feeling like once the baby comes and actually in your chalks, then thangs are going to change, but right now, while you're pregnant, you're thinking, ""I can kind of hang out in both worlds a ickle bit,"" but part of you may be thinking maybe that's not the case. It's time to go to the mom world maybe."
Yeah. Probably. And I'm also feeling like it's too late. I already screwed it up.
"Okay. So, you've got a lot of concerns about what's happened to- up until this point, as far as your drinking. What do you know about, um, drinking poison throughout pregnancy?"
"Well, I know, like, they say not to, but I thought because my charvers didn't really care, I thought, ""Okay. Like maybe-maybe it doesn't matter. Maybe it's just what they tell you."" Just like drinking, in general, is diabolical."
"So, you were thinking because your-your charvers weren't pressuring you to stop drinking, that-that it must be okay."
Yeah.
And then there's this other part of you that's- was thinking maybe it's not okay.
"Yeah, like, I should probably have trusted my gut."
"So, your gut is telling you what? Tell me about that."
It's telling me that what I'm doing is pete tong and it's probably hurting my kid and that- that I'm gonna really regret that once I actually get my kid.
"And you really wanna do what's best for your babe. And kind of wondering, um, how to move forward from here, is that where you wanna, you know, kind of focus in on, or what are your thoughts about giving up drinking altogether?"
"Um, I'm totes it's not-- I think I could probably do it. It's just- it-it comes hard when you're, like, in that mo. You're around your fams and they're drinking and you don't wanna be- you don't wanna be the mom at that mo. You wanna be yourself. You wanna be who you were before."
"So, you kind of have this identity, dual identity going on. I wanna be that bod, yet, that person-"
"And so many peeps, when they have kids, they just vanish from their chums. And I don't wanna be that bod. I don't wanna be that bod that just has a kid and they're totes-totes different."
"Mm. So, embraces this life of the picket fence and the, you know, the ickle drum and having the baby in this-"
"Yeah, suburbs. Yeah."
"So, you don't wanna be that- that- that lass that's just sort of living in this drum with the baby carriage, and at the same time, that world's kind of saying it's behind you."
"Yeah, I-I guess. Like, I don't wanna- I don't wanna lose my charvers because of this. And I don't wanna put pressure on them to change because they're, I mean, they're canny peeps. They're just—"
You care about them.
Yeah.
"It's just the scene that they're-they're still in because their life maybe hasn't taken that change that your life has made. And so now, you're here and you're not sure. You want the baby, but you're not sure about the suburbs and the picket fence thang. You're not sure—"
I don’t want that.
You don't want that.
No.
You want this baby.
Yeah.
"And you wanna be, um, take care of your baby as the baby's growing."
"Like, I wanna- I wanna be responsible for this thang."
You don't wanna let your baby down.
No.
"And at the same time, it's hard to let go of the past, but on the other spud, you're thinking, ""I don't have a choice. I've got to look this way."" Is that kind of what it feels like?"
I guess so. I feel like I've already made a choice and already made some diabolical choices with this.
"Nina, I'm wondering, what's your hope for the future? When you think about where you are today, um, what do you hope for when you look ahead?"
"Well, I-I kept the kid because I wanted-- It was almost like that push, that sign for me to, like, move forward and become like an adult because it's scary, right? Like I-I still feel like a teenager sometimes. And having that push to be a real bod is really-- It's a lot of pressure and I-I want to raise this kid well. I don't wanna- I don't wanna let my kid down. I don't wanna, you know, I don't wanna regret choosing to have this kid because I think it's the right time, but I don't wanna- I don't wanna make clangers that make me realize maybe I'm not ready for this 'cause sometimes it feels like I'm not ready for this."
"You put your heart there that the baby is really- it was almost kind of like a sign for you that was saying, ""This baby is giving you a kind of a new chance at life, or giving you a plan B,"" and you guys both get to decide what plan B is gonna look like."
"Yeah, I just guess it's easier said than done though. Like, it's, like, gnarly, I can make all these changes and I can be a totes new bod, but it's, like, at the end of the day, I'm still just who I am."
"While this baby's growing in you and you think of all the opportunities that could come out of this, there's a part of you that says, ""I'm still that same girl that was drinking and partying,"" and-and maybe not living the life you wanted to live."
"Yeah. And I'm just- you know, you can't just one day flick a switch and become a new bod."
"While this baby feels like this is your second chance, you're wondering, ""Do I deserve that second chance?"" And then this other part of you that says, ""Why not? It's here and I wanna go for it."""
"Yeah, I guess that voice is just a little more stifled by the other one."
"Mm-hmm. You got a lot of peeps around you that are kind of pulling it down, and it's kind of taking you back to the old life. And the baby is a constant reminder that there’s this new life ahead."
"Yeah, it's gonna be very different when it actually comes."
"When you think about, you know, embracing this new life, and taking that different path, turning away from path A and moving into path B, how confident are you that you can take path B and be successful in raising this baby, and letting go with the drinking and the life that you were in-in path A?"
I think I'm gonna have to be successful. I don't really- I don't have any other choice. Like I have to- I have to take that path.
"Mm-hmm. Tell me more about that, what makes you say, ""I have to take that path""? What makes you feel like you need that?"
Because I need to for my kid. It's- it's gonna be all screwed up if I don't.
"This part of you that says, ""I don't have an option to-to-to make this life better,"" it's wondering, ""Do I have the confidence to be able to make that life a reality?"" What do you think you need to increase your confidence that you can do this?"
"I don't know, like, maybe- maybe actually talking to my charvers and saying like- or maybe them actually being able to see this kid and go, ""Of course, of course, your- your choice makes sense. You--"" Maybe it would, you know, give them a wake-up call too if They actually, like, see it."
"So you're thinking that, um, once your charvers see you with the baby in your chalks that they too will see that there's a different path for them too?"
Or at least they'll feel less pressure to be who they want me to be.
"Mm, kind of feel like you're pulled between two worlds there."
A ickle bit.
"It's not putzy to be in that world and also having that constant reminder that the baby is coming and this baby is saying, ""I want this better life,"" and you want to give the baby a better life too. Who can support you, do you think when-when you look around who's in your circle right now, who do you think can support you in moving towards path B?"
"Totes my rents, um, and I probably need to, uh, go and meet some other-other peeps who are maybe, you know, having kids too so that I can see, like how it's done 'cause like, I only have a younger bro who's like not-not even close to that. So I don't really have anyone in my life that I know that's had kids recently. So I-I would like to meet other, you know, young moms out there who, you know, are kind of struggling with the same stuff I am."
"And your rents are a support for you and support you from giving up the drinking, the poison use, that's something that they would support-"
"I don't think they realize, uh, that I'm doing it or how much I'm doing it."
Okay.
"And I know that if they found out, they would be really pissed."
That would be a concern for them as well as for you now.
Yeah.
"Yeah. Is that something that, um, maybe you and I could meet again about-and talk about having those conflabs with-with the fam, maybe having conflabs about, you know, the folks, your-your cuzes that are currently in the lifestyle that you were involved with, um, and then sort of what it would look like to go down path B, is that something that you would be open to meeting with me about again?"
"I think so, yeah, like the telling my rents and [unintelligible 00:13:45] this to my rents is probably the scariest thang."
Mm-hmm.
"And having to talk to those charvers, like right now I don't want to do that. It's- it puts them in a weird place."
Kind of feels like you're climbing Mt. Everest.
Yeah.
And you don't have equipment.
It feels like I have to lec- I don't wanna have to lecture them and I don't want it to be like a lecture.
You're stuffed that they're gonna kind of treat you like a chavvy.
My rents or my chums?
"Oh, oh, you're talking about your charvers."
"Yeah, lecture my-- Yeah."
You're wondering if they're gonna kind of be like chavvies and you're gonna be like the rent saying-
"Yeah, and I don't wanna be like that."
You just wanna be like peers talking.
Yeah.
And you want them to support you.
I wanna stay charvers with them. I don't want- I don't want them to just-
"You don't wanna lose your support group, yeah. You just wanna them to support you in being healthy, while helping them, raising the babe, and so we're just taking path B. You don't wanna lose them, just maybe the lifestyle it sounds like."
"Yeah, like if there's a- if there's a balance between maybe not the paths, but the worlds, if there's a balance between that-"
Mm. You kind of wanna have the best of both worlds.
Yeah.
"I want the charvers and the relationship that I get from my chums, and at the same time, I don't want the beanfeast scene that goes with that."
"Yeah, like I-I know I just can't cut off my charvers altogether."
"Well, Nina, you know yourself best, and you know, you know, you know what your world looks like and what those, you know, like, you know the support that your charvers give you and the support that you get from your fam, you know that. And I-I really just wanna support you in being able to make those choices and have those conflabs, and I wanna do whatever I can to support you with that. Um, and I'm just wondering if maybe we can kind of pick this up, um, in a next visit, but before we go there, I'm just wondering, is there some steps that you would be willing to kind of take or consider, uh, with-with regards to your drinking?"
"Um yeah, like I'm so close anyways, that I know I need to now. Um, and I just also, like, have I totes screwed this up, like, is it already too late?"
"You're stuffed about the health of your baby. I just would love to share with you, Nina, that every day without poison is a mustard day for your baby, and you know, starting today to have zero poison is a random start, and I'm wondering if that's the sort of something you'd be open to as no more poison at this point."
"Mm-hmm, I have to do."
"Okay, sounds like this is really important to you. You want to make this happen."
Yeah.
Is there anything that I can support you with before we wrap up as far as giving up poison today?
I don't think so. I think just knowing that it's not too late already is enough kick in the pants to get started.
You kind of got a reality check today.
A ickle bit.
"You did really well talking with me today, and I thank you so much for just sharing your heart."
"Hi, are you Katie?"
Yeah.
"Hi, my name is Beth. I'm the nurse that works with the nurse practitioner Mrs. Smith that you just saw. Do you have a mo to talk?"
"Uh, sure. What's this about?"
"I know you were here to get a prescription for birth control but while you were waiting to see Mrs. Smith, you filled out a healthy habits questionnaire-"
Mm-hmm.
-and you answered some questions about your pot use. Would it be okay if I asked you some questions about how green plays a role in your life?
Sure.
"I notice you use pot regularly, and I wanted to ask you more about that."
"Well, you know they just decriminalized it in Virginia, it's not a big deal. I'm not in pickle, am I?"
"No. No, no, no. Not at all. Um, I just wanted to ask you how it helps you and how you use it. Can you tell me a ickle more about how you use it?"
It's not a big deal. It's just like a couple times a week to relax.
Marijuana is really useful in your life in helping you relax?
"Yeah. I mean, I'm here on an academic scholarship so I have to keep my grades up and I'm on the debate team, so there's a lot going on."
"Mm. You're a very successful student and you have a lot of responsibilities, and it's really adding to your stress."
"Well, yeah. The truth is I'm the first in my fam to go to college so I don't know, I guess, I'm in a bit over my noggin."
Mm. You've been very successful academically and the transition to college has been hard for you.
I've always been an wired bod. Pot just helps me calm my nerves. I'm I in hoo-ha?
"I promise you, you're not in pickle, I wanna help."
"Uh, tell me besides helping you relax, what are some positives about pot?"
"Well, some of these kids are just so much more sophisticated than me so I guess when I party with them, I feel like I'm fitting in. I don't know how else to explain it."
"Hmm. Uh, when you use pot in a group you feel more at pad with your peers and more accepted?"
"I don't know if I feel more accepted, more like I'm trying to fit in by using it."
So how is it working to help you fit in?
I'm not sure it is.
Mm. So smoking pot with your peers to try to fit in more but it doesn't seem to be making you feel more comfortable with your charvers.
"Uh, yeah."
What are some downsides to smoking pot?
"I don't know. I- It helps me relax but I guess I'm hyper I'll get caught. Um, my rents would kill me if they knew that I smoked."
So smoking pot doesn't help you feel more socially comfortable with your peers and it increases your stress because you're worried about your fam and legal consequences?
Yeah.
Can you think of any other downsides to smoking pot?
"Well, I don't have the dosh for it. I just usually bum it off to my roommate, her rents give her a lot of spending wedge but I don't know, it's kind of ladgeful to have to do that."
So smoking pot also reminds you of your financial situation and you don't have extra cash to spend on thangs?
Yeah.
"Katie, it sounds like smoking pot is helping you somewhat in helping you relax and it's also causing you a lot of stress because you're trying to use it to fit in and that's not helping, you're worried about getting caught, you're worried about fam disapproval. Having said all that, what do you think you wanna do about your pot use?"
"I don't know. When you put it that way, it doesn't sound like a very gradeley habit."
Would it be okay if I made a suggestion?
Okay.
"You mentioned at the beginning of our conflab that you have a history of dealing with anxiety, have you ever talked to a counselor about that?"
No. We don't do that kind of thang in my fam.
Can you tell me more?
It's just not done. I don't know. It's something for daft as a brush peeps and we totes do not have the poppy for it.
Mm. So the baldy notion of counseling in your fam is for wacky peeps only and it's looked down upon and the damage would cause a problem too?
Yeah. I just don't see it happening.
"Katie, we know that many kids come to college and have a lot of stress and deal with a lot of anxiety, and we've also found that when they talk to our counselors and learn specific skills about dealing with anxiety, they do much better. Um, and it's been really successful for a lot of kids. Um, I'm wondering if you think it might be helpful for you?"
I don't know.
Can you describe why you're hesitant?
"Well, I don't have the dosh for it so I can't pay for it and my rents wouldn't approve."
"Well, the damage is buckshee and the counseling services we provide, we are legally obligated to protect your privacy. We can't tell your rents. There are some exceptions to that privacy rule, including, uh, mostly if we're stuffed about- that your safety."
"What, like suicidal?"
Exactly.
"Uh, I would never do that."
"Well, uh, we can go into some more specifics if you decide to see the counselor about what-what privacy rules there are, but for the most part, you wouldn't need to worry about us sharing anything with your rents."
Okay. I guess I'll think about it.
"So, uh, if-if you're walking out now, I can walk out with you and just take you around our counseling center. I can even introduce you to one of the counselors."
Do I have to go there?
"No. No, no. I just wanted to show you where it is and let- make sure you know about our resources here at the college."
"Okay, sure. I agree, let's go."
I just feel helpless about this whole deal.
You're hopeless about what's going on.
Mm. I just feel helpless about this whole deal.
You seem at a loss of where to go from here.
No one wants to help me.
You feel like peeps aren't willing to help.
No one wants to help me.
You feel alone.
Mm-hmm. I really shouldn't have done it.
You realize it's something you shouldn't have done.
Mm-hmm. I really shouldn't have done it.
You're feeling regretful.
Mm-hmm. I couldn't help myself.
"Uh, it's something that just happened."
I couldn't help myself.
You're hyper that you've lost control of your behaviors.
It's actually been a fab week.
You've really had a gradeley week.
It's actually been a fab week.
You seem stoked about that.
"Mm-hmm. I know who to hang out with, I'm not saft."
You totes know how to make canny decisions.
"I know who to hang out with, I'm not saft."
"You know that, um, positive peer influences have been helpful for you."
Mm-hmm. I'm letting the whole fam down. They had such high hopes for me.
You feel like you're letting your fam down.
Mm-hmm. I'm letting my whole fam down. They had such high hopes for me.
You feel like you've been a let down for them.
Mm-hmm. This is not what I want for my life.
This is not what you've envisioned.
This is not what I want for my life.
You're willing to take steps to improve on that.
Mm-hmm. I really want to get off the program.
You don't want to be here.
I really want to get off the program.
You seem motivated to follow the rules.
"Mm-hmm. I still crave smoking, even though I've stopped."
It's something that's always on your mind.
"I still crave smoking, even though I've stopped."
"It takes a lot of, um, strength to still not smoke, even though you're still craving."
Mm-hmm.
"Well, welcome, Ricky."
Thank you.
Canny to meet you.
"Yeah, you too."
And you found us okay?
"Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Alright.
Yeah. Yeah. pretty straightforward-
Yeah
-always gradeley.
Have you been here before?
"No. No, not at all."
"Mm. Okay. Alright. Well, um, I know a ickle about why you're here today-"
Yeah.
"-um, but it's gnarly to see you, and so maybe a canny point to start with is, tell me why you're here."
"Sure. Um, I guess, you know, maybe two or three weeks ago, I had sort of like this group of charvers come around to my place, and um, you know, they-they were sort of saying that it was just like a night to hang out and watch DVDs and stuff, and then they sort of sat me down and were like, ""You know, maybe you need to get a bit of help for, you know, drug stuff."" Then, you know, I was sort of like, ""Well, mm."" And I was quite humpty by that at first, but I-I suppose, you know, I thought about it for a bit and then I was like, ""Well, I guess it can't hurt to talk to someone about it, maybe."""
Right.
Yeah.
And that's led you to being here today?
Yeah.
Alright.
"Yeah. I just sort of did a bit of search on the internet and stuff and just read about this place, so I just thought I'll—"
"Right. So it sounds like you thought there was something that, uh, that you needed to look at, something that was concerning you?"
"Yeah, I guess. I-I suppose I hadn't really thought about it till they sat me down, and you know- I mean I could, uh, I could understand a ickle bit of where they were coming from, so yeah, I thought I'd—"
They were concerned for you?
Yeah.
Alright.
"Yeah. Yeah, which kind of was a bit of a sh-shock, I suppose."
You were surprised?
"Yeah. Yeah, 'cause, you know, I don't know. You know, you see on flicks when peeps sort of intervene or say, ""You know, you need to go and get help."" And then-- I don't know. Like you know those characters and, they-they do need help, you know-"
Yep.
-because they're fucked.
Mm-hmm.
"And you kind of go, ""Woah. That's not me."" So it's about am I—"
You're not sure that applies to you?
"Yeah, or well, not to that extent, you know what I mean? Like, I-I would-- l didn't think I was at anywhere near a point that I would need to be sat down and intervened with-"
Okay.
-if you know what I mean.
Alright.
I suppose.
"I'm trying to understand you so far, something's concerning you and something's concerning your friends-"
Yeah.
-but you're not sure whether it's- whether-- just how diabolical it is or- and you're just wanting to check that out?
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, 'cause, I mean, you know, they are my charvers and-"
Mm-hmm.
"- you know, I'm not gonna be so narrow-minded as to say for sure that, you know, they're totes pete tong 'cause there's a big group of them, you know? And they do care, so obvs, there's something there that I might have overlooked. But on the other spud, I'm sort of like, ""Well, was it that diabolical?"" And you know, ""Was that- was that really necessary?"" But I, you know, I thought I'd give them the benefit of the doubt and-"
Yeah.
"-and just check it up, yep."
"Because they care about you and-and you respect what they say, and you're wondering whether something about what they're saying may be right, but let's check that out a bit?"
"Yeah, pretty right."
Alright.
Yeah.
"Well, let's do some checking out."
"Okay, cool."
"So tell me a ickle bit about what you're doing, what is- what is the concern that they are raising."
"Um, dr-drugs, I guess."
Mm-hmm.
"Mm, yeah. Sort of kind of do a bit of P now and again-"
Alright.
"-and, um, I guess less often, I do a bit of, you know, I smoke a ickle bit and, um, beanfeast jimmy hills in the- in the weekend sometimes."
Okay.
Yeah.
"Tell me a ickle bit about what now and again means, and-and-and how often."
"Um, a couple of times a week maybe."
"Is this- is this with, uh, with the drug?"
"Yeah, yeah."
This is meth you're talking about? A couple of times a week?
"Mm-hmm, yeah. Yeah. So I guess when I put it that way, it does sound quite a lot, but it doesn't feel a lot, you know? If you know what I mean?"
"Well, maybe, we c-- we can check that out to see whether-whether it's a lot or-- But maybe also importantly to-to discuss with you what the effects are and-and-and what your concerns are about it. But help me to understand a ickle bit more of what it's like for you. Tell me- tell me what are the thangs about your, uh, use of meth that you- that you've liked that you found mustard for you?"
"Right. Um, I suppose it's kind of spud-in-spud with just hanging out with, sort of, some new scene that I've-- Like, um, I moved to Auckland maybe three years ago."
Mm-hmm.
"And, um, I still live in Palmy and, so as you can imagine, it's sort of a bit different down there. And, um, kind of just when I first got here I was sorta introduced a ickle bit to, um, like do you know Family Bar on-on [unintelligible 00:06:49]?"
"I know Family Bar, yes."
"Yeah. It's that sort of- that sorta scene, that kind of, um, gay scene, I guess. And, like, it's not something I'd really thought about before and-- But then kinda hung out there and just met these peeps that were sort of like you don't really get there much Palmy. Well, I mean I suppose you do, but they're not-- You know, in Auckland nuclear subs like that you can just-- Uh, you can just be it out in the open, you know, and I suppose in Palmy you can't as easily. Um, so just to arrive and see that and kind of meet these peeps that were just really chummy, you know, and-and not judge me into it. I don't know. You know, Palmy often is they're sort of like, ""Oh, you've gotta own a jam jar, and soap it up, and drive up and down the Main Street,"" and I just couldn't give a shit about that, you know, so. Or play rugby and, you know, that didn't interest me at all and sorta come here and have peeps, you know, talk about interesting stuff and have a tidy time. I just want to go out and dance and stuff like that. Um, that was quite gnarly for me to know that that existed because I hadn't seen that before and-and I suppose there's a lot of that that goes on there, you know?"
"It's quite a heavy beanfeast scene most weekends and stuff. So it kind of goes spud in spud with that really, and just, you know, I guess when I have-have a slight-- I don't know, you just feel really waxa, I guess. Just feel, like, chuffed as nuts, and stoked, and just to be surrounded by peeps that, you know, really care about you, and love you and-- Coming from a place where y-you didn't-- don't get that as much, it's just really gnarly, you know, to-to be able to go, ""Okay, on this day I can take this."" And it's just that instant, like, ""I know- I know I'll feel rare."" I guess that's part of it."
"So Auckland, coming to Auckland from Palmerston for you was-was like taking charge of something that you were going to look to make something different in your life?"
"Yeah, in-in a way. Although I wouldn't have been conscious of that really. I just sort of discovered it here. It's not like I came to Auckland looking for that kinda-"
Right.
"-lift to get away from, um, you know rents mainly, and that kind of lifestyle, that Palmy sort of lifestyle. But then yeah, I discovered this other thang, um—"
Which you weren't aware of in Palmerston?
No.
Okay.
"No. I didn't really know. I guess you see sort of thangs like that in-in flicks from America you know, but you don't really-"
Mm-hmm.
"- think that it would exist in your own country. Well, not if you grew up in Palmy."
Palmerston. Mm-hmm.
"Um, I don't mean to be mean about Palmy but, you know, it's just the different kinda attitude, I guess, kinda- this done-"
Yeah.
-to that sort of thang.
It sounds like you're ready to move up to something that was different.
Yes-
And-and you came-
-plus-
-here to Auckland.
"Yeah, yeah. I totes wanted to get away from something. I didn't know what too, but then I arrived here and found this thang that was like actually, this was obvs, fate or whatever was pulling me to this thing-"
Alright.
-'cause-'cause like I found something in myself or something that was missing.
And how does that feel for you now?
"Um, now, I guess, now, I'm just a ickle used to it. [clears throat] When I first got here, I was like, ""Wow, this is amazeballs."" This is hard, I guess, but, you know, it's been three years now, so it's just kinda like I've gotten used to it."
Mm-hmm.
"I mean, I guess, I'm, let's say I take it for granted but, um, yes, it's just comfortable now. And, um, it's just a sort of what I do really. Yeah, so, I guess that the drugs are linked to that, I suppose. It's j-- Well, it's just a part of it, I don't really think-- I didn't really differentiate it. It's just kinda, ""Okay, I'm gonna go hang with my charvers,"" and that sort of thang, you know, that Saturday, Friday night thang. And then it just happens really as part of that."
"So coming out, feeling-- being gay-"
Yep.
"-being part of a gay culture here in Auckland, is feeling good-"
Yeah.
-for you?
Yeah.
"And at the same time, it's-it's linked closely with the- with the drug scene with the meth scene for you?"
Yep.
And you're not experiencing where these two thangs are separate? They just seem to be together more often than not?
"Well, I guess, now, that I think about it, maybe it's sort of gone beyond that, maybe I didn't notice that."
So—
"I mean like I always-- Well, it's, you know it's kind of a thang that happens in the weekends but, I guess, sometimes in the weekdays. You know, I'll-I'll pretty much every weekend I'll have a big night, um, maybe two but sometimes, you know, in the weekdays like on a Tuesday or Hump day or something if I just kinda feel like doing something then I might do that sometimes to see if someone else wants to come round and join me or, you know, occasionally by myself I might have a smoke by myself or something like that. And I guess that isn't totes linked to that scene, I suppose."
It just sounds like something's worrying you about that there's-there's a part link there but there's not a link and that-that maybe that the drugs is-is becoming a more important part in your life.
Mm. Maybe. I suppose I hadn't really thought about it-
Okay.
-until recently.
So something's changed recently?
Yeah. I suppose just since that kind of intervention thang or I started to give them the benefit of the doubt. And it's-
Yeah.
-maybe noticing some thangs that I hadn't noticed but—
Tell me about those thangs you're noticing that you hadn't noticed before.
"Oh, I mean, e-even just now, you know, when you asked me how often."
That surprised you?
"Mm. S-surprised me to-to think about, you know, when there's stuff, and you don't really think about it, but then if someone asked you, you know, how often or-- and then you kind of have to quantify it, I suppose it kinda sound shocking, you know, if I- if I imagine myself sort of saying, ""I do this, you know, a few times a week."" It-it-"
Mm.
"-sounds shocking. But to me it-it's- it doesn't feel that way, you know, that's kind of where that, where it kind of doesn't sit right. I, [clears throat] that's why I kind of got a bit miffed at my charvers a ickle bit, or I dunno, a bit defensive there. 'Cause you know, it sounds a lot, but it doesn't feel out of control or anything, you know. It doesn't feel, I dunno, peeps that need to go and see therapists or whatever you kind of go, ""Oh, they're an addict."" You know. They-- Their health is really diabolical and they need urgent help right now sharpish, Uh, well, at least that's kind of the-the feeling you get. And I don't feel that at all. I don't feel like it's a real urgent thang. So that-"
Alright.
-felt a bit weird.
Okay.
Yeah.
"So you're worried a ickle bit about it and you're going to find out more about it, but you're-you're not gonna take on this notion of being a headache or anything as yet—"
Yeah.
Okay.
Totes.
"So tell me then, um, Ricky, what- what's the other side of the gradeley thangs that-that using meth or doing some smoking does for you? Is there a downside to it? Are there problems that you're experiencing?"
"Yep. Um. Uh, I suppose dosh is quite a big thang. Like, I used to have a lot more wedge sorta last year. I had a, quite a waxa job, like a, quite a regular acting job."
Mm-hmm.
"Um, and it was like quite a lot of dosh that la-last year. So it wasn't such a problem then. And I suppose I sort of blew that spondulicks a ickle bit. Um, so now I don't have that acting income coming in as frequently and I'm working in a caff like a sort of part-time and it's not bringing in as much. So now it's kinda like, and sometimes I need to borrow a bit of lookah or sorta need a bit of help with the rent sometimes."
Quite a lot's changed over the last year from—
Yeah. Yeah. A ickle bit.
It doesn't sound like it was part of the plan.
"No. But you know, that's the life of an actor, I suppose, ups and downs works and not works."
Sure. [chuckling] It's not a secure profession-
No.
-and it's-it's hard-
It's not.
"-it's hard. But is-is there, I just wonder, is there a connection at all between the-the-the-the acting and the meth use in terms of the effect of the meth use on your- on your ability to get work?"
Hmm. Could have been a couple of auditions that I didn't do so well and as I could have 'cause of that.
The drug may have had an effect on that?
"Uh, maybe. Maybe it's just my general sort of state. Um,I dunno, sometimes I suppose just kind of weighs on my mind a ickle bit like, ""What am I doing or why am I spending my spondulicks on this?"" I mean, when it's happening, it's like, this is amazeballs."
Hmm. Hmm.
"You know am I-- You go in- you go into places, interesting places, but you know, I could just as well have saved that dosh and actually gone to interesting places I suppose. But I don't know. I wonder if it- if-if it's having an effect. I-I don't know. I can't say for sure, but maybe it's not so canny for the chevy, I dunno. [crosstalk] Dunno if I look knackered or-or run down or-"
Alright.
"-or if I actually am whacked or run down, I suppose. Again, this is thangs that I haven't really thought about-"
Alright.
-but now I'm starting to think about.
Right. And they got questions too-
Yeah.
-to ask are they—
Yeah.
You're beginning to-to think about those thangs and-and-and what effect they may have on you.
Yeah.
And the choices that you might have about it.
Yeah. Hmm.
"What else? Are the-the-the-the problem of around the use of dosh, you know, the choices that you make around spondulicks, and the meth use has taken up quite a lot of the money-"
Yep.
"-over the last year and maybe also the effect on-on um, your job and being able-- maybe you're not auditioning as well as you might."
Yep.
"And maybe the effects um, also on-on your physical appearance. An interesting question around the effect of meth use on physical appearance."
Mm-hmm.
"Um, what-- are there any other problems? Any other thangs that-that are a bit of a downside to this?"
"Uh, I guess it's obvs having some sort of effect on my chums and my flatmates, 'cause, you know, they set me down and said, ""Look you gotta-"
Yeah.
"-look into this or else we can't hang out anymore."""
And that's a problem?
"That would be a problem, yeah."
Why?
"If they didn't wanna hang out, well, then what have I got, I suppose?"
They're important.
"Yeah. Yeah, and I mean part of it, yeah. Part of it I just wonder 'cause, you know, a lot of those charvers that set me down are obvs the ones that are not part of that scene. I mean there were a couple there that-that are, but mostly they were the ones that sort of have always sorta been a bit judgy. You know, like when I first started all this stuff, you know. And clearly, there wasn't a problem like-- 'cause I used to be that guy as well you know, like, ""No never do that 'cause it's diabolical,"" and then you try it the first time and you go, ""Actually, it's not that diabolical."" It's not the end of the world if you're sensible with it, then it's not gonna be, you know."
"You have to take a saft amount to do any kind of like, or, you know, to die or to end up in a hospital."
YHmm.
"So it's provided you don't-- you're not saft with it. Then it's just a bit of fun but you can't really explain that to peeps who are-- have their walls up. So it's hard not to sit in this pad full of peeps kind of going, ""Oh, you know, you really should stop the drugs, they're diabolical."" It's like, ""Well actually, you don't know what you're talking about."""
"Hmm. But Ricky, let me just check, 'cause I may got this wrong, just check with you that um, there are some charvers that you've got who do use who are still stuffed about you. Did I get that right from what you said earlier that-that those who are stuffed about you and were part of this intervention some of them use."
"Yep. Yeah, a couple."
And you-- So they have their concerns and-and you are beginning to-to ask questions of this use as well and-
Yeah.
-it's just that that we're gonna try and drill down a ickle more into just to pick up for you what-what you think might be going on and what you think might be some of the options for you.
Yep.
"And we're g- we're gonna leave labels all that kind of stuff aside 'cause, you know, I'm picking up from you that that's not what that's about."
Yep.
"I'm chuffed with that. What do you think will happen, what might happen if you can turn your-your uses- you're on now? What-what concerns do you have about not making any kind of change?"
"Um, well I suppose the acting thang is a really big concern."
Alright.
"'Cause I want that to be my job, you know. I'm fucking moby of caffs."
This is gonna be your career. This is the career-
Yeah.
-you want to make.
"I'd like it to be, yeah."
"Mm-hmm. It's harder when you're trying to create your career, get that going. You gotta- you gotta be at your- at your top, top pitch."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Yeah, 'cause I mean it's all you know, it's partly lacking and partly being at the right place at the right time. And if you're at the right place and at the right time and it is not on your game then there could have been a—"
"Yeah, and-and maybe the meth use is-is compromising that."
"Yeah, it could be."
Hmm.
"Yeah, and then I suppose also like dosh is linked into that as well, you know, I've-- I'm not doing as many courses and stuff as I used to be doing, 'cause it's, you know, don't have the spondulicks."
"Alright, so it's back to the dosh thang again which is-"
"Well, yeah, I mean, obvs I don't wanna keep pissing my flatmates off."
Yeah. yeah.
"You know, and it's not- it's not gnarly to not pay the rent, obvs. It's not something I'm chuffed to buggery with."
That creates problems?
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Yeah, and I don't wanna be that bod."
"Let's just come back to another thang, uh, that we were talking about a ickle bit earlier, and it's around your meth use as well and-and-and with your gay fams, with gay lifestyle. And-and that sounds like you're saying that-that-that when you party, when you go into the clubs, when you're being with cuzes that the meth use is always there?"
Yeah.
The-the availability of it is there.
Yeah.
"And everyone, most peeps are using."
"Yeah. Not-not necessarily P or whatever but yeah most peeps are doing something. Yeah. I suppose yeah it's kind of part of that scene that there's not a ginormous like, you know, you go to bog-standard boozers and most peeps are just mortalled and wasted and like spewing everywhere and stuff and whereas that's a different scene. Like, peeps drink but they don't drink to that excess but they take other thangs and have a rare time. And, yeah."
And it might be hard to be part of that scene and not to be using drugs?
"Yeah. I mean there are peeps that do that. I suppose it-it would be hard. I-I haven't really thought about it, I suppose. That's all it is, all I've known that scene to be, you know, 'cause I'm quite new to it, you know-"
Right.
-so from the beginning it was always there.
So there is a possibility that there are other parts of the scene that don't rely on drug use-
Yeah.
-or particularly on-on meth use?
"Oh yeah, well, they must be. I can't imagine everyone is there, I guess just the ma-majority or at least p-- the majority of peeps that I know, yeah."
"So that might be something that we can look at but later if you're interested in is maybe what are some of those other parts of the gay scene, whose still beanfeast and beanfeast medley, but when meth is not a- is not a dominant-"
Yeah.
"-factor in that partying, and we- where-where there are, uh, uh, uh, gay groups that support peeps who-who are not wanting to be-- they have a lifestyle that is heavily weighted to drug use. So there are some options there to look at some other baldy notions if you're interested and we might look at that, for you to think about-"
Yeah.
"-to consider, so it's not about giving up anything, it's not about ginormous major changes, it's about how can I improve the situation."
Yep. Yeah.
It's what I'm hearing you saying bring-- be a ickle bit more in control of what's-what's going on for me.
Yep.
So that I can pursue that plan.
Mm-hmm.
What could be a- what could be a first step towards that?
"Well, [coughs] I must say I was a bit, um, you know, at the start when I was sort of saying I, you know, this is how often I do it and then I found myself talking about the kind of the weekday stuff I kinda took myself back a bit there. I suppose, you know, on a Hump day by yourself like it doesn't sound that canny."
"So that needs some thinking about, doesn't it?"
Yeah.
As to what-
Yeah.
-what would work for you-
Mm.
-as an alternative.
"Yeah. Yeah, but I think you're right about, just something to look forward to, because it's that midweek slump, you know. So far away till peeps will be in their place where they can-"
Yeah.
-hang out and have a gradeley time.
"Yeah. Yeah. And there are thangs that have gotta work for you, so that-"
Yeah.
"-that's your baldy notions on there which are really important. But again there are some options, that if you wanted to look at, you know, just to at least be able to know what they are."
Yeah.
Because there are clubs and there are groups and there are all kinds of thangs that meet through the week.
Yeah.
"And so, though they're not going to be necessarily like the beanfeast scene, they are other activities. Now I'm talking about gay groups and gay activities which are an option that-"
Yeah.
"-you know, gradeley to know about and-and-and maybe in-- within those options or something you might say, ""Oh yeah, I'd give that a go. Have a squiz."""
Yeah. Yep.
"He, um, introduced me to it too, so I've tried it."
"So with his encouragement, you-you tried some drugs."
Oxy.
You tried oxy? Okay.
Yeah.
Okay. And he encouraged you to do that.
"Well, yeah he said it was a pain- a pain medicine."
He said that it would help you with some of the pain that you've been having.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
"And it has, but I don't do it as often, it's just sometimes."
"Okay. So you trusted him on that, and you tried it out and you found that it helped you in certain ways. What are some of the thangs that you said it's-- takes some of the pain away, it's not just-- you know."
Dealing with my grandma's loss.
"Okay, so that's helped you."
"Yeah. I feel alone, and I just, I miss her and, it does- it does help but,-"
Mm-hmm. So it help—
-I don't wanna have to rely on having to take that.
"Okay. So it's not something you wanna rely on, you don't see yourself continuing to use this. It's something that you've found at least for the mo very helpful?"
"Mm-hmm. Yeah, and—"
"But it's not something that you wanna make a habit of becoming reliant on, or dependent?"
Right.
"Yeah, okay. Um, and-and so that's a lot going on right now for you? Yeah."
"Yeah, it is."
"You've been managing in the best way you can. You also have some doubts about it too, it sounds like?"
"Yeah, well, I don't really know too much about it, other than it makes me feel gradeley."
"Okay, so for now you know that it makes you feel gradeley."
"So Tom, this infection is been pretty gammy for you but we have antibiotics. If you take it faithfully for 10 days, I'm sure that your infection will be gone. Can you do that?"
Totes.
And do you mind if we talk about a screening form that you filled out earlier today on drug use?
Okay.
"Let's take a shufty. It says that on occasion you use, uh, drugs other than medical reasons. Which drugs do you use?"
I do some meth.
"Snort it, smoke it?"
"Snort it, always snort it."
Don't inject it?
Mm-mm.
Use any other drugs?
"Just, you know, some poison."
"And, uh, um, you do this how often?"
Meth?
Mm-hmm.
"Um, two, three times a month."
So you're an occasional meth user. You don't use very often?
Right.
Only snort it?
Right.
"Well, as I think you know, Methamphetamine use is associated with some health punts. And the amount that you're using it-it puts you in a category that we consider a dodgy user. And that contrasts with someone who it says addicted, um, someone who's a heavy user but it's not in a healthy category because peeps who use Methamphetamine tend to run to a number of consequences. And actually one of them is, um, sexually transmitted diseases. Do you suppose that your STD might be associated with your Methamphetamine use?"
"Yeah, it could be because, uh, I was high when I had unprotected sex and I would not do that if I were not high."
So you're normally very careful and you use protection when you have sex?
"Totes, yeah."
And it seems to you that methamphetamine may have clouded your judgment?
Yeah.
Anything else happening with Methamphetamine in your life? Is it affecting you in any way?
"No, I mean, no. I mean, like I said, I only do it in clubs, you know, with my charvers, uh, two or three times a month at-at the most. Um, uh, I don't think it's really having other impacts. But I'm-I'm stuffed about this one. I never expected to get gonorrhea."
"Yeah, you know, I'm stuffed bout it too and I'd actually recommend that you stop using Methamphetamine altogether. And, um, there-there are a lot of reasons for this but that's-that's would be my recommendation."
"I-I understand but it's I think that would be a hard thang for me to do. You know, I mean, I know I should but, I mean, that's like my whole social life. You know, I mean, all my chums go to these clubs. That's where- that's where I see them. You know, that's my sex life basically and, uh, meth is just- it's just a part of it. You know, I mean, everyone is doing it there. You know, so it's while I would like to stop it's-it's kind of hard to think about doing that right away."
"So you recognize Methamphetamine has some problems associated with it and you also on the balance see that a lot of your social life and your sex life involves Methamphetamine, it would be difficult to quit using?"
"Yeah, I don't think it would be putzy but I'm not saying that I'm not willing to try."
"Well, if you were to, um, consider how ready you are to stop using Methamphetamine completely-"
Mm-hmm.
-with zero being not ready at all-
Mm.
"-and 10 being ready, where would you put yourself?"
"Uh, three."
Why not a one or a two?
"I mean, this has been really uncomfortable, you know, gonorrhea is a really diabolical experience. And, uM, I know I don't think the same, you know, when I'm- when I'm on it. And, uh, I mean, what I have is diabolical nuff, I could easily get AIDS. I could get HIV the same way. So that scares me a lot. That's why it's higher than a one or two."
Are there any other concerns that you have about Methamphetamine?
"Well, I do just snort it but you don't know what it's cut with, you know, there could be something, you know. It could be really diabolical, um, if it was cut with something dangerous or something. I mean, I-I worry about that sometimes."
"Mm, so when I was first talking to you, I thought that you'd have a very, um, really not much interest in not stoping using Methamphetamine but it sounds like you have a number of reasons why you really would like to stop using Methamphetamine. And that is, um, that it might be cut with something else, um, you could get another ST- STD including HIV."
Yeah.
"Um, what do you think would make it easier for you to cut down or quit using Methamphetamine?"
"Something else to do on weekends, you know, different social life."
How could you get a different social life?
"It's the hard thang, I mean, almost everybody I know uses it."
Is there anyone in your life who doesn't use methamphetamine?
My skin.
Does she-- Have you talked to her about your meth use?
"I haven't really talked to her about it. I think she knows it I do it sometimes. I mean, we're pretty close. I think I could talk to her about it, and I think she would probably help."
"So on the one spud, it would be difficult to quit using Methamphetamine because there are so many positives that you get from using it. But on the other, there are reasons why you want to quit using methamphetamine."
Yes.
And there's some thangs that you might be able to do that would make it easier to not use methamphetamine including talking to your skin and getting some support.
Yes.
"Well, gnarly. I recommend that you not use Methamphetamine at all but what you do is up to you."
Okay.
I could see you again in a month. Would that work out for you?
"Yeah, sure."
Pretty gradeley. It's been three months now.
Canny.
"Um, and—"
"Since the-- since you used, uh-- since the last time you used meth, right?"
Right.
Okay.
"Right. It's been three months, and I've been doing pretty well."
Good.
"Um, and I met a couple new charvers."
Canny.
So—
"So-so, uh, have-- last time we talked, you know, you were kind of cutting the-the ex-boyfriend out. This is because he was your dealer, so--"
Right.
And how is that going for you?
Right. It's been gradeley. I haven't answered the phone when he's called-
Okay.
"-and a couple of my other charvers have tried to call me as well, and I haven't answered the phone. Um, so it's been canny for me to just reach out and like, meet a couple of new peeps, um, in the neigh-neighborhood that I'm living in."
"So it sounds like you've made some gradeley changes. The change in your environment, and some of your behaviors, and, uh, and these new chums."
"Yeah, the new charvers, and I've been using the, you know, the breathing exercises you taught me, when I get-- start to feel a ickle wired out, and I've been- I've been using those and it helps me. I go for a dander and do my breathing exercises, and it calms me down and kind of gets me through that time."
So it sounds like--
"All right, Catherine, welcome back. I'll be interested to, sort of, after we met last time, what-what were you-- what have you been thinking about over the week 'cause, you know, I-I remembered last time I asked you what you were thinking about coming, but-"
Mm.
-what was different this time and your thoughts about coming?
"I suppose, my expectations are a wee bit clearer as to why I'm here."
Yeah.
"I guess, I'm-- It made me think about how much dosh I have been losing recently. So, yeah. I'm happier to be here. [chuckles]"
"Okay, okay. So, there's a shift from last time?"
Mm-hmm.
"Yeah. Yeah. My sense is we'll be able to work pretty well together. That's my, sort of, sense of, uh-- After last time, I thought, you know, ""Here's a young lass who's, you know, got some energy to get thangs together-"
Mm.
"-and, uh--"" So, really, what we'd like to talk about today is-is get a sense of, um-- Let's talk about the thangs that would be canny to work with, um, over the next, you know, nine months together, really."
Mm-hmm.
"So, one of the thangs that we started to touch on, last time, was this issue of gambling, and, um, you were talking, last time, about how the gambling had, sort of, got you into grief with your fam."
Mm-hmm.
"Yeah. So, thinking about, like, you know, last time, you-you started to say that, well, you thought it was-- you deserved it and there was some thinking around that, so I'm, sort of, wondering how open you are to-to exploring that from some different angles?"
"Yeah. I'm chuffed to explore it, so to speak. [chuckles]"
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah.
"Yeah, so how-how-- You know, like-- 'Cause, sometimes, when we start to open thangs up, and then you think, ""Oh, it feels a bit uncomfortable."" So, how do you manage thangs when you get uncomfortable? How have you managed those in the past?"
"Hmm. I don't know, I probably lock off a wee bit. [chuckles]"
"Yeah. Yeah. So, how would I know if we were talking and you were blocking off? What would I notice, uh, in our session together?"
"Yeah, um. I'm sure you've already noticed. [chuckles] Um, I don't know, probably fidget."
Yeah?
That's why I am still a bit—
"Yeah, that's okay."
[chuckles]
"So-so, what would be really helpful maybe because I might miss it, you know, so, like, could you tell me? It would be really helpful if—"
When I'm feeling uncomfortable?
"Yeah, yeah. If you could just say, ""Ken, hi, I am starting to, you know, tune it out here, starting to get uncomfortable,"" that would be really helpful."
Okay.
Yeah?
Mm-hmm.
"Yeah, thanks for that, okay. So, let's think about the-- It has to do with how you just sorted out the thang around the gambling 'cause last time you were here, you told me that you get a buzz, you know, it seemed like you were gambling a bit more than your girlfriends were aware of, and-and you said you owe one of your chums some wedge."
Mm.
"So, um, how heavy do you think this issue is to sort?"
[sighs] I suppose it's really heavy if I wanna get out of my-my-my debt.
"Yeah, okay."
"Credit comes out of my lugs, and mom and dad aren't bailing me out anymore, so-"
Yeah.
"-I suppose, I've gotta sort it out myself."
"Okay. So, again, on a scale of 1 to 100, how serious-- how important is it to sort it out? Yeah."
About 80. [chuckles]
"About 80? Right up there, yeah, yeah? And another question that's, sort of, related to that, how confident are you that you can, you know, you can actually get it sorted and get on with life?"
"I'm gonna say, I'm totes confident."
"Yeah? But, what would-"
Yes.
-your level be on a scale of 1 to 100? Where does your confidence sit?
"What, on my confidence to stop? [chuckles]"
"Well, to get it sorted. Not necessarily to stop. But we don't- we don't know whether-whether stopping's the right answer here, I don't know, but-but, your confidence to sort it out."
"It's hard when it's part of your lifestyle, you know?"
Mm.
When I went with my girlfriends to the nuclear sub last night and I went and hit a bit of a flutter-
Hmm.
"-so, you know, I think I'm a bit weird if I just sit-sit at the boozer on my own. [chuckles]"
"Yeah. Yeah, so-so, you fluttered last night with them?"
Yeah.
"Yep. Okay, okay. And-and when they stopped fluttering, were you still fluttering or did you stop with them? Where-where were you with—"
"Oh, I had to stop halfway 'cause I'd ran out of dosh. [chuckles]"
"Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah, yeah. So, you were saying before that, you know, there was, you know, dosh you couldn't really afford-"
Mm-hmm.
"-'cause you owed your mom and dad some dosh, and they weren't bailing you out anymore, and you had to go out and find some spondulicks, I think?"
Yeah.
"Yeah? Yeah. Yep. So, it seems like almost, like, you're still in the behavior, you know, still creating some problems?"
Mm-hmm.
Yeah? Yeah.
Yeah.
"There's some feelings when you, kind of, think about that?"
"I don't know, but I'd like to get back on track, but—"
Yeah.
Not really planning on spending my life in debt. [chuckles]
Mm.
"I don't mind traveling, and, you know, I've got charvers that are saving for the [unintelligible 00:18:27] and I'm 25 and working in retail, and got four credit cards-"
Yeah.
-so I won't be doing any traveling any time soon.
"Okay. So, again, that, sort of, sounds really important. So, what's-what's your dreams? What are your dreams? Where do you wanna be in five years' time? Where does Catherine wanna be? What do you wanna be doing? What are your dreams?"
Maybe I wanna have traveled and found the chap of my dreams. [chuckles]
"Yeah, yeah."
"I don't know. Kids maybe, but-"
Okay.
"-I'm not gonna- [sighs] I'm not gonna make a decent mom the way I am, at the mo, am I? So I probably need to get on track at some stage. [chuckles] I'll be pushing 30 and still in debt, at this rate."
"Okay, okay. So, it seems like you're-you're, kind of, in a state in your life of considering your next steps."
Yeah.
"Yeah? Yeah. ""Do I continue with the, you know, my ickle current lifestyle,"" and you are so much the beanfeast girl you used to be-- I was speaking to last time-"
[chuckles]
"-wasn't that-- Is that right? Yeah? So, ""Do I live a beanfeast lifestyle-- beanfeast-girl kind of lifestyle, or am I got some other dreams to follow?"" So, they're hard calls to make. And-and it all-- And there are no three ways. We will have to make those calls at some point."
Mm.
"And, my sense, is that some of the challenge for you, at the mo? Yeah?"
Yeah.
"When you think five years ahead, which-which position do you wanna be in? Which-which feels best? Beanfeast girl still, you know, with those four credit cards maxed out major, or would you wanna be actually, you know, thinking about having traveled and, you know, maybe, starting a fam, those other thangs? Which-which direction feels best for you at this point?"
"Beanfeast girl at 30s is a bit sad, really, isn't it? [chuckles]"
I don't know.
I don't know. It's been fun up to now-
What's your hunch? Yeah.
"-but I really do wanna travel, so."
"Yeah, yeah. Where in particular? You've got any baldy notions about what—"
"Um, Egypt, always been, yeah."
Egypt?
Yeah.
"Uh, what's that about Egypt, that, uh?"
"Oh, I just think it's just fascinating."
Yeah?
"Yeah. Just the, um, the outlook, and the culture and the history and-"
Oh.
-somewhere I've always wanted to go.
Yeah.
"It's not the safest place at the mo, mind you, but [chuckles]."
"No, that's true."
Yeah.
But for bait times.
Yep.
It could be very different.
Mm-hmm.
"Yeah. Okay, so you've been-- How long have you had this-this baldy notion for that that's what you'd like and that's where you'd like to go?"
"Oh, since I was young, early teens."
"Oh, yeah?"
Yeah.
"Mm. So how much does the kind of, uh, current lifestyle rob you of that, you know, take away from that dream?"
"Yeah, well, I suppose with the amount of dosh I've spent over the last five years I probably could have gone to Egypt and back five times by now. [chuckles]"
"Yeah. Well, yeah."
Mm.
"There you go. So there's some decisions to make around, uh, which dream, which path you wanna follow."
Mm.
Hmm. What do you reckon to be the-the hardest bit of taking that pathway to-to traveling and realizing the-the dream? What would be the hard thangs that you'd have to confront?
"I believe then to cut off some of my friendships. Um, 'cause since you see that's, you know, part of their lifestyle."
Yeah.
Yeah. It will be a big change.
"Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. So I see this is- this is something you've been thinking about for a while. So how far away do you think you are from that change? You know, 'cause obvs it can-can be on the never, never, but how far away are you from it, making some decisions about that?"
"Seems like a bit of an unrealistic dream. Um, and I'd like to take the first step but, uh, that's gonna be putzy."
"No, no. That'll be putzy. So what is the first step for you?"
"Probably, um, [chuckles] cutting up the credit cards for a starter, and trying to restrain myself, and not to be led into temptation, I suppose, so."
Okay.
"You know, if the pokies are at the nuclear subs, just don't go to the nuclear sub. [chuckles]"
"Yeah, it's hard, isn't it? It's hard being in the nuclear sub thang, in that environment."
Mm-hmm.
"We'd-we'd-we'd have an illustration for them, I suppose. We call those high-punt situations. You know, it's that-- so you might learn some lingo about some sort of the way that we describe-"
Mm. [chuckles]
"-it and stuff, but, you know, being at the nuclear sub, you know, you want to sort of get the buzz of, you know, gambling, you know, horror situation, really putzy to just go against what you decide that you wanted to do. Yeah?"
Mm.
Yeah? So how today have you sort of found some ways to manage that?
"Um, I haven't managed it to-to this point, so [chuckles] I don't know."
Mm.
"Um, I suppose I've just got to get tougher with myself."
"Yeah. I think somewhat being hard with yourself, what-- yeah, peeps often say that, but, you know, it's not-- I think there are some thangs that you can do, and you've already-already identified a really waxa strategy."
What? Cutting off some of my friendships?
"Well, it's a couple of baldy notions. O-one, thinking about who your chums are and will your fams support you to realize your dream of traveling to Egypt."
Mm.
"Um, and the other baldy notion you talked about before was, actually, cutting up your credit cards. So kind of amazeballs what that thang makes there on different cards isn't it?"
Mm-hmm.
"It's very helpful and healthy. So, yeah, a couple of really gradeley baldy notions already you've got, guess so?"
Mm-hmm.
Yeah. So that's-that's some work that we can continue to work with. Yeah? Yeah?
Yeah.
"So 'cause-'cause I asked the question before, is what might be the hardest thang, and you'd identified that your chums, you know, could be one of the habits."
Mm.
"Yep, yep. Could that mean that some of your charvers are probably moving around some similar sort of stuff like you, wondering about where they're going and-"
Mm-hmm.
"-what they want to further their dreams, yeah?"
Mm. Yeah.
"Okay, so we talked about sort of where thangs you-w-- Where you might be in five years and which path you wanna take, yep, yep? And you seemed very clear about it."
Mm-hmm.
"Yeah, yeah. Something we can- we can do over the next while is-is really get some very concrete thangs in place to support you to do that."
Yeah.
Yeah. So what's one thang you can do between now and the next time we meet?
Find the scissors. [laughs]
"Yeah, find the scissors."
Cut out the girls.
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"Then, um, I don't know if the debts are still gonna be there or not but I-I've gotta find-"
Yeah.
-a way to pay them off and-
Truly.
-I don't know how I'm gonna do that.
"Yeah. Okay, so sounds like so-some budget to buy stuff will be helpful."
Mm-hmm.
"Yeah, and of the thangs that-that we often put peeps in touch with here is some budget advice service, it's a nang service here, um, and something that you can get to."
Mm.
So let's talk about how we can organize a-a meeting with them.
"Mm-hmm, that will be gradeley."
Okay.
Yeah.
What else has brought you here?
They found a ickle bag of weed.
Mm-hmm.
It's not a lot though.
Mm-hmm.
It's not like I was gonna sell it or anything. It's like—
Just nuff for your own use?
"Yeah, whatever, you know. It's California, no one cares."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
How long is this gonna take?
"Yeah, we-- You know, we have about 15 to 20 minutes to talk today, total. Um-um, which deffo it's just the first of-of some sessions that we'll have together over the next six months. It'd be a natural question you'd wanna know how much time this will take, of course. Um, what else would you like me to know about you and your perspective that you think will help me work with you over this time?"
"I just wanna get whatever I need to get done, done."
Okay. You're more focused on what you need to do to get this behind you?
Yeah
".Okay, mm-hmm. Well, I'm wondering then if it's okay with you and-and I have a form that we can use if you'd like, um, just to put out some different baldy notions on an agenda that we could share as we're working together so that I-I can support you to be successful in getting this behind you. Would-would this feel like a natural time to-to move towards figuring out where we might go together?"
"So, you've got this dream by the sounds of it, which is, you know, to have a partner, and a drum, and a canny car-"
Yeah.
"-so don't forget the canny jam jar, and some kids, and be a- be a mustard dad-"
"Yeah, yeah."
"-to your kids. So, is this dream starting to-- I am getting a picture of?"
"Yeah, it'd be gradeley."
"Yeah. Okay. So, what I'm really interested in is how offending fits in with that picture, that dream."
I guess it doesn't.
"Yeah, how doesn't it fit, Billy?"
"Uh, I guess I have to keep coming-coming back here and go into court and stuff."
Yeah?
Yeah. It kinda messes thangs up.
"Yeah. It kinda messes up that dream, that picture?"
Yeah. It makes it harder.
"Mm. Makes it harder? Yeah. Well, it can make it harder to keep a job, aye?"
Mm.
And harder to—
"Like it's hard to get a job 'cause you have to say that you've done clink time and stuff, so it's pretty hard."
Yeah.
Yeah.
And we've talked about that baldy notion of you getting a job and something to do with jam jars 'cause that's where your passion is.
Mm.
"Yeah? So, what have you been thinking, um, since we last met, about what you might do about getting that kind of job?"
"Uh, I don't know if-if I would go into polytech, done courses there or something."
Mm-hmm.
"Yeah. Like, if they've got jobs now."
"Okay, so you know some peeps?"
Yeah.
You've gone down that frog and toad of kind of going back to school in some ways and getting a tryout or-
"Yeah, yeah."
-getting a qualification?
Yeah.
"Yeah? So, what-what would interest you about going down that same, sort of, path?"
"Just learn more about jam jars and just, kind of, spuds-on job."
"Mm-hmm. Yeah, so what in particular? Like, if you could have whatever you wanted, in terms of that sort of work, what would you do?"
"[sighs] Mechanic, or panel [unintelligible 00:18:02], or just-- I wouldn't care, I just-- as long as it's jam jars."
"Mm-hmm. So, as long as it has to do with jam jars, you'd be sweet with that?"
"Yes, pretty much."
Yeah?
Yeah.
Okay. So-so what sort of thangs do you think you need to do to go down that path to get that qualification?
"Just I have to get that training, I guess, and then probably get a job."
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
"Okay. So, what sort of training did you-- did these peeps, that you've been talking about, what did they do?"
"Like, sort of, um, just at the polytech. I don't know what exactly it was, but—"
Mm-hmm.
"It took them like-- And, it took them like a year or something, and then they went into apprenticeship."
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
"Yeah. So, how confident are you that you could do something similar to these-these charvers that you've got?"
"Yeah. I could do it pretty easy. It's just, like, I probably know all this stuff already."
"Okay. So, it would be pretty putzy. So, if it's pretty putzy, what do you need to do next, Billy?"
"Like, well, I went out and picked some forms and stuff, but it's real spinny, like, having to apply, so I-I just couldn't-- I don't know. I couldn't do it."
"Okay. So, you actually went to the polytech—"
"Yeah, yeah."
-and picked up some forms?
"Yeah, yeah. Passed around and everything."
Wow.
Yeah.
"That's mega, Billy."
"Yeah, but I just-- Like, they wouldn't help me out, so-"
Okay.
-I got some forms and-
Tell me- tell me what happened when you say they-- like it didn't help you? What-what-what happened?
"I asked- I asked them what I had to do, and they said I had to fill out some forms, but-"
Yeah.
"-well, the forms, it's too spinny."
"Okay. So, they gave you a horde of forms for a particular course?"
"Yeah, yeah. Well, I got one- I got one for panel [unintelligible 00:19:33], and one for, uh, uh, like, panel and paint-"
Mm.
"-so, learning how to paint jam jars and stuff."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Okay. So, you got the forms, took them- took them home?"
"Yeah. I was gonna fill them out there, but then I didn't get them, so I took them home, but I was gonna get Donna to help me, but I just didn't get around to it."
Mm-hmm. You said the forms were confusing?
Yeah.
Yeah? What-what's the spinny bit?
"I didn't understand, like, what you're supposed to write down. Like, yeah. I'm not gradeley at this, maybe too spinny."
"Yeah. So, when you've had to write thangs or fill out forms before, how-how's that been for you?"
I don't really deal with it. I s-- I don't really like writing.
You don't like writing?
No.
"Yeah. So, wondering what that's about, about not actually liking writing."
"No, I'm just real clarty, so peeps can't read it."
People can't read-- People can't read your handwriting?
"[chuckles] Yeah, no. It's what they say, yeah."
"Oh, you must be a quack."
"Yeah, I am. [chuckles]"
Yeah? [chuckles] Yeah?
Yeah.
"Okay. So, you need some help to fill out the forms?"
"Yeah. Like, a pooter or something. If you could write on a pooter, I could do that."
Mm.
"But, we don't have a pooter."
"Okay. All right, so what-what do you need to do, Billy, to actually get to that point where you can fill out a form and post it off?"
"Just ask to get someone else to do it I guess. I guess I could ask Donna, but it's been ladgeful."
"Okay, so you feel like it would be ladgeful to ask Donna to give you some help-"
Yeah.
-because you feel that she might find out something about you that you're not quite sure you want her to find out?
"Well, I don't know if it's that heavy, it's just-"
Okay.
"-I'm sure most peeps can fill them out. I don't know, I just don't get it."
"Hmm. So, who else could you ask to help you?"
No one. I guess you. You could do it. Would you do it?
"Well, have you got the forms with you?"
No.
"Okay. I'm wondering about-- because it sounds like this whole baldy notion about filling out the forms, is getting in the way of this bigger dream that you've got which is around getting a qualification around something to do with cars-"
Yeah.
"-and getting on this frog and toad where you're staying out of grief because you've got this, um, interest-"
Yeah.
"-which you can do. So, it seems a real shame that the forms are gonna get in the way, so we need to find a way around the forms."
Mm.
"Yeah? So, what do you think, between now and next week, you can do around the forms?"
"I guess, I'd go pick them up and I don't know, I guess I could ask Donna, but she'd probably help me, I don't really want to."
"She'd probably help you, but you don't really want to. It sounds like you're a bit embarrassed."
"Well, I don't know. Plus, well, I don't know if I could bother getting up at nine o'clock every morning and having to go to Polytec. I've got used to sleeping in."
Mm.
At night.
"So, the whole thang about going back to poly-- going back to school-"
Yeah.
"-going back to polytech is-- would-would require a really big change in the way which you're currently living, and you're not quite sure if you can do that."
"Yeah. Uh, it would be gnarly if it's anything like school. Like, I didn't really enjoy school. [unintelligible 00:22:56] so writing and stuff, and I wouldn't wanna do that. If it's all spuds-on though, it would be all mustard."
"Yeah. So, there's something here about your level of-- about how confident you are around writing or how unconfident you are, that sounds like it's getting in the way."
"Yeah. No, it does get in the way. I just don't wanna do it."
Mm. Okay.
It's a crap of time.
"All right. So, it sounds like we might need to have some more conflab around that."
Yeah.
"So, what's really getting in the way?"
For what?
"Well, this writing business. What's really getting in the way?"
"Of what? Well, I don't get it."
"Well, I'm wondering, like-- it sounds like it's a thang that you're putting up as saying you can't do-"
Yeah. I can't.
-so I'm wondering where you are around your writing and you're reading?
"Oh, it's pretty [unintelligible 00:23:47], but, like, still-- I don't know, I'm not retarded, or anything. I can write and read."
Mm.
Yeah.
"Yeah. Well, I have to say, I think it's really bait that you're not retarded."
Like--
[chuckles]
Yeah.
"Yeah, we are having a really gradeley conflab here."
Yeah.
"So, reading and writing is not a strong point for you."
"No, not really. Yeah, I don't really enjoy it."
Mm.
Yeah.
"So, how much reading and writing is involved in the course that you're gonna go on?"
"I don't know. Hopefully, not many-- not much, but that's what I wanna find out, I guess."
"So, what'd it be like if you were more confident in your reading and writing? What'd that be like?"
It'd make everything easier.
Mm.
"Like-- I don't really like reading books or anything, so I don't really care about that but just, say, real-life stuff like going to the bank, and stuff like that-"
Mm-hmm.
"-yeah, that have filling out forms."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"And, I guess that there will be manuals and stuff like that on-"
Yeah.
"-your course that, you know, to-- the spuds-on stuff, it sounds like you're really confident around doing, but it's the more reading, writing, book, kind of, stuff that you are not so--"
"Yeah, I didn't think about that."
Mm.
"Yeah, that'd suck if you had to read, like, a big manual or something. Hmm."
Mm. Okay. So- so like before you get to here where you got this dream and there's some thangs that need to happen before that.
Mm.
"Yeah. So, mm, we need to think about what's the very first step."
So you're moby of this?
"Yeah. I-I just-- I can't shoplift anymore. You know, I got- I got caught again. And uh, you know, I-I got suspended, I got back to school, so I'm-I'm uh-- I'm gonna mess up my whole life here, unless I can stop this."
Mm-hmm.
"Yeah, it's diabolical. My chums and I, we just-- I mean, it's fun and uh-- so I don't know what to do, but I- but I gotta change."
Okay.
I want it.
"So, it sounds like you're ready. You're ready to give this up."
Yeah.
"But, maybe the path to doing that isn't so clear."
"Right. I don't know what I'm gonna do, I got some charvers. These guys are-- they're diabolical griff, but they're my cuzes."
Mm-hmm.
"And, uh, and it's fun."
And it's fun.
You know?
Mm-hmm.
"Chuff-all-chuff-all much else going on that's as fun as this. We go in, we steal these CDs. It was working out fine, but—"
Uh-huh.
"Thanks for coming in today. I guess you've, uh, sat in that seat with lots of peeps like me in the past."
Mm.
"Yeah. And you have some baldy notions about that and some experiences about that. So today I wanna- be canny for us to talk about that and, um, I'm really interested to know what you've been thinking about in terms of what you may wanna change in your life 'cause we're gonna be working together for a while here."
"Right. Neat. What, um, what have I changed, what am I—"
"What you've been thinking about, um, over the last ickle while about getting your life back on track. 'Cause I noticed you've—"
I've been thinking about how putzy it would be to deal P again.
Yeah.
"I mean, I've been thinking about, um, how I could actually set myself up the right way doing it the pete tong way."
Sure. So what I'm picking up is-is that-that-that's a life that you know a lot about.
Mm.
"And you can make lots of dosh and set yourself up well. What's the other side, because I guess when I talk to guys like yourself who have done time, often they're thinking about actually, mm, maybe life can be with different. So I'm wondering where-where you're at with the kind of thinking about—"
"Well, at the end of, you know, that last week inside, I was- I had that kind of, okay, what's next buzz? And, you know, it just doesn't work out here."
Okay.
"I don't have a, uh, uh, I don't know what that is."
Sure. So life on the outside is pretty different than the kind of-
Yes.
-the expectation of life on the inside something?
"Yeah, it's worse."
Yeah?
Yeah.
So tell me how you've been managing. 'Cause I don't know if you'd been back dealing? How have you been managing to-to-to—
"I haven't yet, I mean-"
Okay.
"-the, uh, the offer's there."
Yeah?
"Um, I don't know why I haven't said that I will yet but I mean-"
"Uh, tell me-"
-it's there.
It's there and-and-and you've a lot of contacts?
Yeah.
"You've been in the system, so lots of context. So this isn't a new challenge for you."
No.
So what stopped you over the last-- How long have you been out now?
How long have I been out?
Yeah.
"Three weeks, one day."
"Three weeks, isn't it?"
"Three weeks, one day."
So what's been there? What's it about that you haven't done in three weeks one day?
I don't know.
22 days you've actually made a decision not to-to pick up your old life and continue on.
"Um, I'd- I- you know, I kind of told myself not to, you know, just before I left. And then I'm just kind of with it and I don't quite know why. [clears throat] I dunno, if, uh, there's no real reason why I haven't yet. It's just that I don't- I just don't think it'll work the way I always dream it will you know, I see myself up like, whatever, if I do that again, the next pin is a long one. A real long one."
Okay.
And I-I can't go back there. There's no way I'm going back there.
"Right. So the one spud you've-you-you could sit yourself up and-and take the punt, but on the other spud, you know, that actually it might not last?"
"No, never lasts."
Never lasts. Mm. You seem like a bit of a crossroads to me.
Yep. I've been in crossroads for 12 years.
Mm. But there've been times when those crossroads would be more sort of focused than other times.
Yeah. And- [crosstalk]
Yeah. And it sounds like maybe like-
"-sort of opposite, yeah."
Yeah.
"You know, we're in the middle, you know, and it's actually at the mo, I guess."
Yeah.
"But I don't know. You know, that's quite clear that no fucking baldy notion."
Okay. Okay. So—
Do you have an baldy notion?
"No. Well, I've-I've got lots of baldy notions, but I'm really interested to hearing your baldy notions kind of first though because you know, and there might be some thangs that we can work on."
Mm.
"But I guess what I'm really interested in is-is you've made a commitment 22 days, drug-buckshee. Haven't gone back into that lifestyle. What-what's keeping you, 'cause you're at the crossroads, you kind of just pause there at the mo. I'm not sure about this other bit over here. What keeping you in that place?"
Fiona?
Yeah?
Yeah.
Tell me about Fiona?
"She's told me that it's over if I do it. You know, I mean, she-- What tell you about, Fiona I mean she's been with me. She's the one who stayed through all the shit. And I owe her-"
Okay.
-something.
Okay. So you've been with Fiona for how long?
12 years.
"12 years. Okay. So she's stood by you then for the time, [crosstalk] but this time she said, it happens again I'm out of here?"
Yeah. She's actually got the black and white line down now.
Okay. And it sounds like you're listening to that black and white line.
"It's pretty she- you know, she could be pretty full-on."
"Yeah, yeah."
"Yeah, so it's hard to ignore that line."
Yeah.
"I mean. And it comes with a whole lot of different rules, and you know, she's never been quite like she is now."
"Okay. So something's changed in your relationship between you, yeah?"
Yeah. I think she has. I don't think I have.
Okay. So what's Fiona want you from you?
"She just wants me. I mean, she just wants someone to be there. Me. She-she remembers me and she wants- she wants him."
"She wants him. So which him does she want, Daryl?"
"The one that, you know—"
Does she want the- did she want the-the him that she fell in love with and saw gnarly thangs in?
"Yeah, that's the one."
Or does she want the-the-the-the him that's- that keeps on getting into pickle?
"No, no. No one would want him. I don't want him. He's a fuckwit, right? She wants the one that she fell in love with."
Okay.
Yeah.
So what's it gonna take to reclaim this Daryl that she fell in love with?
"If I had the answer to that, I wouldn't need to be sitting here."
"Sure, yeah."
"And I mean, I honest- I don't know, man. I don't know. I-I wish I knew somewhere I could start that, you know, could give it to her, but I-I can't. I-I don't know."
"All right. Well, let's-let's just play with this baldy notion a ickle bit, Daryl. So what did Fiona fall in love with? What were the qualities of Daryl that she said, ""This is him""?"
"I was pretty romantic. I mean, I was pretty quite sleekit, and, um, you know, I was on top of my game, like, she- and she loved it. And we used to laugh in the [unintelligible 00:06:45], you know? And just- it was always really sweet, and peeps used to say, ""Oh, man, you two. You two have just got it,"" you know? And we lost it, so whatever that was, that's what she wants. We were young. How do you become young? Uh, you know, I'm old, and we'll keep growing old, but you know?"
I know.
"Like if I'm not careful, I will be."
"Sure. Everyone will age, but that will happen on time."
"Yeah, deffo."
"Um, but that's okay. So-so it's she fell in love with this, the sense of fun, the sense of Daryl, and thangs have changed, but she's still with you?"
Yeah.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah. And you're still with her?
"Yeah, yep."
"Yeah. So catch me up with the conflabs you've had with Fiona about this crossroads you're at. You know, these 22 days, you haven't gone back, you've coming out and you're not back? You could pick up this dealing quite easily and probably some workout here tomorrow and get back into it."
"You know what? She hasn't even talked about the dealing, like, she won't even broach that subject. That's how black and white she is. She's- she'll be- she offers suggestions, you know? What I could do, and- or I kind of go with that, but none of them are-- You know, it's lovely that she's really finding thangs, but they're not the thangs. I mean, it-- I started kind of placating her and making it okay to keep giving me suggestions, but like, I need to come up with something because it's like awesome love, but you know, not in love, and she's getting moby of it already."
"Okay. All right. So-so back together, thangs are starting to get tense at drum, and your relationship a ickle bit?"
"A ickle bit that. Yeah, ickle-ickle bit tense. Yeah, that's fair."
Yeah. Don't put words in your cake-hole. I'm sure if that is—
"No, they are."
"Oh, yeah? Yeah?"
"I mean, not like they have been because we've only just started on the new frog and toad, but I mean, yeah, tense is the right word."
"Second, I'd like to talk, Daryl, about this all- whole baldy notion, that's this crossroads baldy notion, yep? So on the one spud here, you've got this 12 year history of being in the other system and done some time and being away from Fiona, but you're now back, sitting back together, and you've got some choice about where to go. So, in that 'where to go', what baldy notions have you been thinking about in terms of where this-this Daryl, non-dealing [crosstalk] guy—"
"Well, I don't know. I haven't got ickle, um, nuggets of where I could go. I've just got like this feeling that I should go somewhere."
"Okay. Yep. So a part of you knows you need to go something different, but the direction doesn't seem to be that clear at the mo?"
Yeah.
It [unintelligible 00:09:33] picking up?
Yeah. No baldy notion.
"No baldy notion. Okay. So I'm wondering, you've been in the system a while. You're now 34, is it right from the pick-up?"
[nods].
"Yeah. So, you know, often at 34, guys start to think about being with a girl in their life and what's important. And-and you would have also been part- not as a guy, so they've actually made some shifts and changes and thought, ""Time to move on""."
"Yeah. Well, um—"
And now you've got—
Not many.
Not many?
Mm-hmm.
But some.
"Um, oh, I've got. Yeah, one. [chuckles]"
One?
One.
Yeah.
"Mm, yeah."
Yeah?
"Okay, so, um—"
Tell me something about that.
"Well, he-he was- he was inside with me the first time I was ever inside, and now he's a drug counselor."
Okay.
"So, he's the- he did it."
He did it?
"I don't know how the fuck he did that, but, 'cause because he wasn't even a real addict, he was just-- Well, I mean, I don't know. He's very gradeley with peeps."
Yeah.
"Really gradeley at talking, and, uh, but anyway, I don't know how he did it."
"Cool. So how interested would you be to find out more griff about how he did it? 'Cause I'm thinking about this is someone who you know, you've done time with, got a relationship."
"Yeah, but I can't ever be a drug counselor."
"No, I'm not suggesting you-- No, not about being a drug counselor, but about he made that transition from-from being involved in crime-"
Yeah.
-to a transition about being in a different place.
Yeah. I think he would have found some higher grunt. They find-- I'm not gonna find one of them.
"Okay, no 12-step higher grunt baldy notion?"
Yeah.
"So that might work for him, but what might work for you?"
I don't know. That's why I'm here.
Sure.
I don't know what that is.
"Okay, so part of being here with me, and the work we might do, will be to find- try and find- search for that-"
Okay.
-thing. Whatever it is.
Gradeley luck.
"Well, it's a search, isn't it?"
"Yeah, I don't mean to be rude-"
No.
-but I do mean it's a big ask.
"Yep, it is a big ask. So what qualities would you need to have to-to go there?"
Fucking guts.
Guts? Yeah?
Is it a quality?
I think it is.
"Yeah, I'd need some of them."
"Yeah? So you're the sort of guy, Daryl, with guts?"
Am I?
Yeah.
"No, not yet."
Not yet?
"Well, no I'm not."
Yeah?
"No, I don't have that-that-that much courage."
Yet you're sitting here with me today-
"Oh, I have to."
-and-and-and you're talking about stuff.
Yeah.
"Well, you're sitting here, and you're talking with me-"
"Oh, okay."
-about stuff that's-that's quite deep-
Yeah.
"-in a way. Um, that takes guts. That takes bottle."
All right.
"In my view, it does."
Okay.
'Cause you could've come in here and said-
It's a bit caggy handed.
"-""Look, Ken, you know, I'll come in, report in, I'm outta here."""
"Ah, yeah. I could've done that"
"You could've done that, but you're not. So I'm wondering what's different? 'Cause you may have done that in the past, I don't know, Daryl, with other peeps like me, but-but sounds like something's different this time."
"I'm older, you know? It's not as much fun."
Yeah?
I used to take the piss outta you guys-
Yeah.
"-all day long. We all do, but-"
Sure.
"-it's not funny. I mean, and you're-you're a gradeley guy, I imagine. I mean, in fact, you don't deserve my shit. I just-- I don't know. Canny luck."
I kind of see a sense of sadness there when you have to kind of think about this.
"Oh, sadness. You know, I don't wanna wallow, you know? You know, you've gotta take, you know-- You make your own opportunity in life, don't you?"
Yeah.
I just never did.
"Okay. So I'm interested in this baldy notion, let's, uh-- Opportunities come and go all the time."
Do they?
They do.
All right. Not to me.
Well you said before you had an opportunity to pick up and start dealing again.
"Oh, yeah. Oh, heaps of those opportunities."
"And-and so-so-so there's opportunities- there's opportunities in one world, and I'm wondering about what might make it hard to see opportunities in a different world?"
"Yeah, well, the different world isn't offering me opportunities. The different world is offering me a night shift, and minimum wage, and, you know, chuff-all. So it's like, set-set yourself up, set your goal up, or, um, don't, and that's your-your pro-social living, and that's your, you know, old behaviors."
"Sure, sure. You're in the system-"
Mm-hmm.
"-you're not in the system. Pick up that, where is it gonna take you?"
The system?
"Yeah, what-what's gonna happen if you start dealing again?"
"Chap, I've been fighting that system-"
Yeah.
-and all it takes me back is to the-the inside-
"Okay, okay."
-I mean—
"So-So again, I'm-I'm wondering about this other world, and you're saying it doesn't look to chung at the mo."
"Well, I can't see it."
You can't se it?
"You know what, if I knew what they'd look like-"
Yeah?
"-I-I might, you know, buy that."
Yeah? You just described to me how it looked like a minute ago.
Did I?
Minimum wage-
Oh yeah.
"-night shift, juice station."
"Yeah, that's not much fun. That doesn't look very gradeley."
Yeah?
"Yeah, that looks really hard."
Yeah? It is really hard.
"I know that's the right thang, uh, don't get me pete tong."
Sure.
"That is gut right there, going to a job you hate, going home, cooking yet missus a din-dins, looking after your kids. I mean, that is-- That's what it real mean does, but I don't have that-- Th-those guts to do- to do what you do."
"Sure. We talked about bottle before and you've got the guts to be talking with me about this stuff today, and I'm wondering if you actually do have some bottle to think about these baldy notions. I'm not saying that pumping gas at minimum wage is where you wanna go, but-but the guts to actually start steeping into this other world. I wonder if you do have, I'm-I'm-I'm just not sure."
"I-- Hmm, maybe."
"Maybe. You're not convinced at the mo, I understand that and, um—"
"No. You know, convince me because, you know, I kind of want to be."
"Sure. Well, it's hard to me to convince you-"
Right.
"-'cause this is your life and this is your jackanory, and you-you've got to walk your life and I can't walk your life for you. I only walk my. And so, but I can walk with you on this life to try and think about-- 'Cause I-I-- You know, I-I've no interest in actually you falling over and going back into-into a lifestyle a crime 'cause I know where it'll take you. And I'm hearing that with your relationship, where it's going to take your relationship too, [unintelligible 00:16:39] got the bottom line drawn pretty clearly."
Mm.
"So it seems like what's gonna push in this direction, just tip that balance a ickle bit to give this other world of go? Because it is new, it's different. It means doing stuff, a lot of stuff actually that-that's kind of mundane."
"It is the ickle thangs, yeah, like waking up, and having a cup of char and sitting on the porch is kind of gnarly."
It's kind of gnarly?
Yeah.
Not part of on the wire?
"No, you don't get to sit outside-"
No?
-on the porch.
You don't. And who's sitting on the porch with you?
"No one. It's morning, it's just me."
Mm-hmm.
"Birds, trees, yada yada."
Cool. So I'm picking up this world actually has the freedom to you to be your own chap?
"Mm, you know, maybe."
Maybe?
"I don't-- You know, that-that was canny. If it was full of bits like that, sure, but I mean, you know, eventually you have to go off to your job and-"
Yeah?
"-you know, pay your-your wages, I mean your-your mortgage and-and-"
Yeah.
-it's just massive.
Yeah it is. It is.
It is.
"Absobloodylutely massive. And, uh-- So, is there a challenge you're up to, to start creating some-some-some of that sort of world for Fiona? 'Cause I'm hearing that—"
"You know, peeps like me are unaccepted into that world though. You know? I've got-- I don't have qualifications. All my mates are in Down under working awesome jobs, mining for 160K a year, you know? Just being chaps digging holes. Like, if I could do that, yeah, all waxa but fuck, I have just come out of nick, I don't have any NCEA. I, uh, I had one opportunity and I fucked that because I can't do night shift 'cause I'm lazy. You know? Maybe the world is giving me opportunities and I just don't need them. Maybe I can't do that."
"Sure. So what I'm hearing is, you're not convinced at the mo."
"No, I'm totes not convinced."
"No. So what would convince you to-to make that shift? 'Cause I hear a lot of kind of-- And in this hard, like, y-you've done time and then once you've got a record, the employers- you know, we know, I know that. That's-that's not putzy. You can't just wonder into a job, a high-paying job and go, ""Pick me, pick me, pick me."" I know that."
No.
You know that.
"Yeah, I know."
"So, um-- And-and maybe it's about piddly steps and first steps."
"Yeah. I mean, yeah, it is obvs, it is first steps, but I mean, what's that? What's the first step into the pro-social life?"
"Well, you trying to get a job, maybe and get into some routine."
"I just know if I get a job that I hate, I just won't do it."
Okay.
"You know, I can make in an hour what I can make in a night or a week of nights. It's pretty-- You know, from where I'm from that a really-- You know, there's no decision at all, that's just like, what are you up to if you don't?"
"Yeah. I'm scrambled though at the mo because you're saying, ""Yeah, I could make in a night what you make in a week,"" but you've haven't. 22-22 days-"
Yeah.
-and you haven't done that. So-so tell me what that's about.
"I just told myself I wouldn't this time and then Fiona said, ""You will not"" this time."
"So you told yourself you wouldn't, so you're once you- you're the sort of guy that once you make a decision you're gonna go, you're staunch with that decision?"
"Yeah, even if it's the pete tong one, yes."
"Oh, it's a decision whether it's right or wrong-- It's not gonna be-"
"Yeah, but I'm that kinda guy."
"Yeah, you're that kinda guy okay, so once you make a decision. So you made a decision that you're not gonna- you're not gonna go back to dealing?"
"Oh no there wasn't a decision to made, I just said, ""I won't yet""."
Yet.
"Yeah, I said yet."
You're keeping the door open-
Yeah.
"-at the mo, is what I'm picking up."
I hate that.
"Yeah, okay, so that will be a call you-you've got to make."
Mm.
"I'm-I'm not gonna- I'm not gonna make that call. You'll make that call, but there's a consequence of making that call, and there's big consequences more time probably and Fiona not being around. On the other spud, what I'm picking up is a call to-to do some- do some stuff that may not be racy and exciting and in the big dollars, but me being with Fiona and engaging in this transition into a-a different life."
"Mm, yeah."
Yeah.
And we're still no closer.
No.
But I mean yeah it's there.
But we're talking about it.
Yeah.
So how much time have you been talking about this-
"Oh, fuck."
-position?
"With anyone other than Fiona? No time at all, I'd say for about 10 hours with you."
"Okay-okay, so the fact we're even having a conflab about it, it's kind of interesting?"
Yeah.
"Yeah, so I wanna summarize, Daryl, what-what I picked up so far and then just so I make sure I'm really listening to you well 'cause it's important, isn't it? 'Cause, you know, it's important you're listened to-"
Mm.
"-by peeps me. So what I'm picking up is-is-is that if you've-you've got this long 12-year history, you can make some big spondulicks or you can dealing, doing crime, that stuff, I'm-I'm picking up that Fiona's set the bottom line, is if you go back in that lifestyle, she's out of here, yet she stayed here for 13, 12, 13 years?"
"Yeah, 12, nearly 13."
"Nearly 13 years, so and-and so-so she stuck with you, and I'm pick up that's important to you, um, and-and-and yet you talk about it, it just seems putzy, this bit over here, this whole lifestyle."
Mm.
"This other lifestyle over here though when we talk about, actually thinking about, you know, doing stuff, doing the stuff that-that everybody else generally does, [unintelligible 00:22:30] will gets on doing, it doesn't have that same kinda seem to excitement, and it doesn't seem to be a-a starting point for you over here."
"Uh, that it-it does kinda seem exciting."
"Oh, it does?"
"It does, because it's so different."
"Right, okay."
And I'm kinda over that one.
"Okay, you're over that one, okay. So, let's start to think about what might be the first step."
Yeah.
"Yeah, with while going in, I think you got a high steep."
"Okay, I."
"Yeah, a steep, you see before you had a mate who turned his back on offending."
Yeah.
And for him this 12-- You wondered that the 12-step stuff working for him.
"Yeah-yeah, it does work for him."
"Yeah, maybe that, I'm wondering the conve- the conflab with him that might be around actually how did he do it, and how did he stay without slipping back across the line, 'cause like-like get this crossroads you've got the path and go the other path and go here, so I'm wondering about conflab with him, what would it take to have that conflab?"
"Uh, ringing him."
Ringing him?
"Mm, yeah."
"Yeah. You seem a ickle surprised, I'm-I'm [crosstalk] wondering about, surprising coupon."
"You-you know, it was a long time ago that we were inside. I just know that's what he's doing. It would be pretty rum calling but the- he'd probably be okay with it."
So possibility to call?
Possibility to call yeah.
Yeah there's possible.
Yeah.
"Yeah, okay, and Fiona's been pretty staunch."
Mm.
Is someone who actually who has some pretty clear baldy notions about where she wants you as a couple to go-
Mm.
-I get a sense.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Well, I just have to do what I'm told. I don't know."
"Yeah, but I'm picking up though behind that doing what you're told, she's got some hopes."
"Oh, yeah, I was being, um, chipping, I mean, yeah she has more hopes than me, you know."
So what will it take for you to start thinking about some of her hopes and sharing some of her hopes?
"Um, like I do- I do but what it would take, you know, I mean, that's pretty freaking scary shit."
Yeah?
Yeah. And I would never admit to that.
You said before you're sort of guy that once you make a decision you're pretty staunch with that decision.
Yeah.
"So if you made a decision to go there, it might be a scary as shit but again it seems that, uh, it could work if see it look, this is important, this relationship's important, let me go for—"
"Yeah, but my-when I made my decision to not do that yet like I was very clear I understood I know that picture. If I'm gonna make a decision to do this, I kinda need to really-really know what that is. You know, not only to talk I mean-"
Sure.
"-what is the whole plan to-to call-call up you know and say, hey bro, hey bro, uh, how did you do that? I mean, really? Is it—"
"Yeah. That's-that's what I'm thinking- I'm thinking actually. Here's someone that actually has made a different decision then, uh, it sounds like that's the pathway that starts over here and I'm wondering. I wonder whether you might have wisdom about what it's like to t-to tread that path."
"Yeah, like, I guess I could be wondering that too."
"So you know there's a part of you going, I was thinking in this place that's hard work."
Hmm.
And this is a pretty lonely frog and toad to-to walk by yourself. I'm wondering who else might be around you that might actually walk with you?
There's Fiona.
Yeah.
"[unintelligible 00:26:37] getting out so what-what he did. Um, dad's only as mean. There's Fiona."
You know maybe they'll walk that frog and toad with you too.
"Yeah, okay, uh, all right, yeah. All right."
There's a couple of peeps.
Yeah.
If you want to do that. It gotta be your call.
"There, um, what brings you in today?"
"I don't know. I'm just having a ickle bit of, uh, having a ickle bit of hoo-ha dealing with, uh, my criminal history and, uh, you know, trying to stay on the right path, but, you know, um, it's just- it gets, you know, it gets kind of overwhelming, you know. Um, I really wanna be, you know, a waxa productive member of society, but at the same time, you know, I got this background that nobody will overlook, you know. So it kinda makes it like, well, what, you know, do I go back to what I know?I mean, you can only work for $5, $6, $7 an hour for so long, and it's really frustrating. It's causing, uh, some anger issues to resurface and some depression to resurface and, um, you know, and, um, I don't wanna fall back, you know."
It's really getting in the way of you becoming who you wanna be.
"Yes, it is."
Yeah. So what-what-what about your criminal record is blocking you from getting where you wanna be?
"I don't know what about it is, um—"
"There's a, uh, your record has a conviction?"
Yeah. It has a felony conviction on it.
"Okay. Ah, there's-"
"And, uh—"
-the big pickle. Yeah.
"Yeah, it is. And it's- I hadn't anticipated that it would have been-- You know, so at the time, it was just like, ""Okay, cool. I'm not going to jail."""
Mm-hmm.
"You know, and, um, now, it's like, okay, so this is more like a life sentence than it was a four-year sentence that they were offering. You know, I mean, I think it would have been diabolical either way, but, um, I hadn't anticipated that this was gonna be this difficult, especially since I went back to school and, you know, uh, got a degree and actually want to do, you know, some, um, corporate level or, you know, professional type of work."
"Mm-hmm. So when you, um, when you put in applications or anything like that, the felony con-conviction, whether you know it or not, seems to knock you out of the ballpark. You're not even considered as an applicant?"
"No, I'm not. Um, in situations where I don't know about it, I don't know about, I mean, if I'm not considered because of that, I probably-- Um, you know, that sucks too. Don't get me pete tong. I mean, I-I don't- I don't get callbacks a lot because of that issue-"
"Mm-hmm, mm-hmm."
"- I'm sure. The ones that really count are-are-are, you know, are kind of just, you know, uh, making me so salty and, you know, kind of spilling over into the rest of my life or the ones that I get coupon chevy, especially after a really waxa interview. And, you know, most of the times, I interview darn well. And, um, it's, you know, I get the vibe that the job is offered almost halfway through the interview because, you know, they start telling me about what I'll be doing and what I'll be getting.And then, you know, when it comes to sign on the paperwork and I believe in honesty, so I tell them, you know, hey, look, this is what you're gonna find, you know, and, um, try to explain it. It's just-it's almost like night and day."
Mm-hmm.
"Black and white. It just stops right there. ""I'm sorry. I can't really do much for you. I-- You have to go,"" you know, and it's—"
"So do you- do you, um, put out there about the felony conviction before you even go for the interview?"
"No. I mean, there's different situations, you know. Sometimes they ask and, you know, I'll say something like, you know, ""We'll discuss at interview"". Uh, sometimes, there are situations where if I probably put that, I don't get a callback and those situations I don't know about. You know, but there are also times where I get an interview through, um, you know, uh, uh, some sort of connection or something, or like a buddy of mine or a fam member will send me on an interview. You know, I don't have to fill it out- fill out an application for that. They just usually, you know, give you the interview. And at the end-"
Seems like it's a done deal.
Yeah. It seems like it's a done deal. You just have to go through the motion of having the interview. And then-
Mm-hmm.
"-when I go through the interview and it goes well, and they're like, ""Okay, well, you know, I think we can do something"" and then, ""Here, sign this, sign that,"" and the other thang. And it's like, but we just had a coolio, you know, I mean, I qualify. Like what does that have to-- Seven years ago, six years ago, what does it have to do with anything? Now, especially because, you know, the type of conviction, it wasn't a non- it wasn't a violent conviction. It's not like I'm a danger to the staff around me. It's not like it's a, you know, a theft type of thang. It was, you know, it was a possession, you know what I mean?"
Mm-hmm.
And
So you didn't hurt anybody.
"No, I didn't."
"You didn't hurt anything, right?"
It's really frustrating because-
Yeah.
"-it's almost like I-I don't wanna give up, but it's like, I'm not given any other choice, you know?"
"Yeah, 'cause you're-you're, especially with going back to school and having done all that footwork and stuff. I mean, you really have something to offer somebody."
"I do, yeah."
"Yeah. And, um, and at the time the big crisis was actually maybe clink and all the crisis around the arrest and-and, uh, you know, it's like you're a leper and the leper colony."
Mm-hmm.
"Um, have there been any times when you've started the interview with that conflab so that you don't even have to go through the whole thang and then get rejected?"
"Not that I can think of, no."
Mm-hmm.
I think—
What do you think would happen if you did that?
Probably get booted out right away-
Mm-hmm.
-you know? Um—
"Would that be, um, what would they be like versus getting through this gnarly interview, knowing you're-you're canny for the job and all that kind of stuff, and then they boot you out?"
"Well, it's-it's sucks either way. You know what I mean?"
"Mm-hmm. It's, uh, I mean the lesser of two evils is that what we're getting at-"
Mm-hmm.
"-you know what I mean? If it's gonna make thangs more efficient like as if-if you're what you're trying to say is if that's something that I could do and then if they get past it, then now I know that there's an actual intention by the hiring peeps to hire me."
"Right. If that's a deal-breaker and you both know it from the very beginning, I'm wondering if then really the interview is really something else. I mean, whether they get the job would truly be based on the interview and not-not your criminal record."
"Yeah, I think as far as maybe efficiency, you know, weeding out the thangs, not wasting my time, you know, but I had to tell you something, a lot of the peeps that don't care about that type of thing-"
Mm-hmm.
"-are not the sort of jobs that I really wanna be doing. You know what I mean? Um, I don't know, it's just really frustrating."
"Not like you're working for the government or for a bank or, you know, the FBI where- those are not thangs you're applying for. They're jobs where you would wonder why a-a non-violent felony would even--"
Be an issue.
Right.
"Right, and then the other thang is anybody that I might tell that to-"
Mm-hmm.
-that doesn't care-
Mm-hmm.
"-are probably not jobs that, you know, are worth going to get the interview."
"Mm-hmm, you didn't go to college for that."
Right.
Mm.
"Do you know what I mean? If I want to work at a moving company and I tell them off the bat, you know, from the gate, I tell them I have a felony conviction, just so you know before the interview and they don't really mind. I mean, that's gnarly, you know, but at the same time, I don't- I'm not looking to be a mover or-"
Mm-hmm.
"-a burger flipper or something like that. Not that there's anything pete tong with it, but I feel like I have a ickle bit more to offer-"
Mm-hmm.
"-you know, and, um, I don't know, it's a really, it's-it's like being caught between a rock and a hard place."
"Mm-hmm. So, what have you looked into about, um, you know, advocacy in that endz or expungement or anything like that?"
"I have done, and my mince pies have, you know, just become like mush after all the reading I've done on this situation."
What did you find out?
"I found out that I have the type of, um, felony that's expungable, I don't even have the type that's sealable. I have apparently the type that has to go on the governor's desk next to death row, you know, inmates or the candidates for, um, a gov- a governor's, uh, pardon. I-- That's what it all boils down to is that I have a class one felony-"
Uh-huh.
"-that needs to be, if any, you know, options, the only option I have is for, um, governor's clemency and I can't figure out why because it's-it's, I mean, I just, I maybe there is a loophole somewhere, I don't know."
"I-I didn't know that. So I, you know, I know a ickle bit about it, um, and not, yeah. So that's-that's very interesting. Oh, what about advocacy groups?"
"I've looked into, um, a fe- um, I've looked into a few groups that are supposedly helping convicted felons get-"
Mm-hmm.
-work.
Mm-hmm.
"Um, again, the-the only-- I mean, I think what I saw was a whole bunch of, you know, brown bread end jobs."
Mm-hmm.
"And the other thang that I saw was that it was very politically charged. You know, I didn't think that, um, I was, uh, you know, allowed to kind of get an interview right away with one of those counselors that they offer. Um, I-- it just didn't seem like a type of place that was willing to help, you know. And-and, uh, I saw that there was a lot of, um, I wouldn't say racism but I would say a ickle bit of racial favor, I suppose. And, uh, I found it really hard to get in and to get an interview with a counselor to match me up with a job. Um, I think that those-those types of groups are gnarly if they work. I just haven't had any luck with, um- at working with- through that group."
Mm-hmm.
You know?
Mm-hmm.
"Um, you know, I don't know. I don't know if there's anything else out there."
Mm-hmm. So you're-you're Middle Eastern. So you wonder-- I-I bet you've had experiences where you really have experienced some absolute racism and prejudice because of that.
Mm-hmm.
"And then, um, you walk into these places and they might just be almost storefront-"
Mm-hmm.
-type places. And the job market is swag.
"Right. It's-it's, uh-- There is a lot stacked up against me."
Mm-hmm.
Let's just put it like that.
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
"You know, uh, but that isn't—"
What do you have going for you?
"Well, that's what-- yeah. That's-- I mean, uh, I'm able to, um-- I'm able to carry a conflab."
Mm-hmm.
"So at some point, I would imagine that maybe I strike up conflab with the right person-"
Mm-hmm.
"-that would probably want to hire me regardless of that sort of thang. Um, I think that at the this point in time, that it doesn't really matter what degree you have. I don't believe that it matters where you went to school. I think it's all about who you know. You know, we live in a very politically charged city. And I think that even if we didn't live in a politically charged city, at this point, jobs are so scarce that peeps who know peeps who know peeps are the ones that are ending up, um, at work-"
Mm-hmm.
"-and getting jobs. And I think that, um, if I continue to, you know, go to school and, uh, you know, uh, get time from that felony, you know. So it's been seven years now and—"
It's a long time.
"Yeah. And at some point, I probably don't even have to report it, you know, and I have that going for me. It's been seven years. I have the fact that I'm, you know, uh, gradeley at, um, interaction with peeps, that's mustard."
Mm-hmm.
"You know, um, I've been clean from that sort of lifestyle for that long so that's-that's-that's up for me, you know, that's-that's gradeley. Um—"
And you can- you can prove that and document that.
Yeah.
Yeah. A lot of folks can't.
They don't.
"Yeah. And you've been going to school. I mean, all-all your movement is in this really positive, highly motivated way. And, um- and I think your-your thoughts and baldy notions about the fact that one day a conflab will- you'll strike up with somebody and it will happen to be with somebody who works for a company that happen does not have a policy against hiring peeps with felony convictions."
"Yeah. Well, that's my hope."
It's individual. Yeah.
Yeah. That's my hope.
It-it is individual.
"It is. It should be. You know, I-I—"
It-- I believe it is.
Yeah.
"There's no-- I don't think, any State or federal law that says."
"No, no. It is an individual but you're right. Yeah. It's—"
Okay.
But here's the thang is—
"Right bod, right company-"
Right.
-we're looking for here. Yeah.
"The thang is after, you know, after the 9/11 attacks, a lot of companies have blindly implemented, you know, those types of situa- and-and there's no- there isn't, at this point-- I mean, I don't think, at this point, there is no real sure fire way to find out what those reports are, you know, accurate or not. I mean, there's a lot of situations where peeps's reports are not even accurate about their criminal background."
Mm-hmm.
I think that-
Mm-hmm.
"-blindly, peeps have implemented those types of, um, measures and they don't have any efficiency with them because they don't- you know, I mean, everybody is offering background checks now and stuff like that. And I'm- that's one of the thangs that I'm yellow of is that peeps are implementing all these security security measures, but they don't really know if the reports are even accurate, you know."
I wonder what it'd be like if you ran your own background check and got the report to see what's in there.
I have.
"Oh, you do?"
"Yeah, I do. I have one and, uh, um."
Gradeley for you doing that.
"Right, yeah."
Yeah. Smart.
"Yeah. Thank you. I don't know. I'm just, I guess-"
Discouraged.
-what I'm really—
"Discouraged, yeah."
"Yeah, I'm really here because I think I'm- I-I- It's a very dangerous endz for me when I'm discouraged because-"
Mm-hmm.
"-you know, all the- despite all the gradeley thangs that I have going for me, the only thang that's loud and clear are the thangs that I don't have going for me."
Mm-hmm.
If that makes any sense.
"Uh, yeah, it does. Uh, I am yet to- it-it seems to me just in this time we've been talking together that you, um, um, do have a sense that a lot of it has to do-do with, uh, timing, luck, who you know, and being, are you able to have that conflab where you know that you can sell yourself and your skills and, um, and your competencies and the fact that you've overcome so many thangs like, um, substance abuse problem and, uh, have been, you know, uh, a mustard upstanding citizen all this time. Um, to me, if I were an employer, you know, I would- I would be impressed with that."
Thank you.
"Uh-- You're welcome. And- so what about, um, I know I had a client that told me a couple of thangs. He was doing some work on this, uh, if you- if you'd be interested I could tell you what he shared with me."
"Yeah, yeah, I am."
"Okay. Um, he found the most valid griff on blogs done by felons."
"Oh, okay."
They are your experts.
Very interesting.
"And, uh, they-they are actually, uh, uh, much what you have said, they said, but they also, uh, uh, talked about which places and companies they did find were open. For instance, fam-owned businesses just tend to-- They can, if they can--"
"Yeah, again, it's like who you know, right?"
"Right, right."
I know that-
Or start your own business. That was another thang that I thought was really--
"Yeah, well, I think that's what I got. That's what I am doing. That's what I'm sort of involved with now is like, you know, find, um, you know, I'm still continuing to go to school, but I'm also starting, um, work for myself. Um, you know, it's not no Fortune 500 company or anything, but I do have a ickle bit of income coming in from that."
Uh-huh.
"Um, it-it, uh, you know, it will all come together."
So being an entre- being an entrepreneur fits for you.
"You know what? Actually, one of the thangs is that I read is that is that's one of the thangs you gotta do is just, uh, start your own business. You know what I mean? Uh, you don't have to report to anybody. I mean, obvs, I can't work with, um-- unless I get a waiver I can't work with, like, I think the law says I can't work with kids or, um, like a hazmat stuff."
Mm-hmm.
Like truck driving and stuff like that.
Mm-hmm.
"Uh, but that doesn't matter to me. You know what I- you know, I'm kind of- I'm trying to look at the thangs that I can do."
"Well, that, you know, now that's a-a really different way of looking at it than how you were looking at what you can do versus what's getting in your way that you know you can't do."
Right.
"So, um, what kinda- what-what are you starting? What's this business? If you-you don't have to tell me if you don't want, I know it's on the up and up, but you don't have to tell me if you don't want."
"No, it's, um, uh, like a beanfeast planning event, you know, like a wedding planning, not like a wedding planner, but like—"
You'd be so gradeley at that.
"Like, you know, like corporate events when they have, you know, like an event, you know, they need-"
Uh-huh.
"-you know, they need chauffeured transportation, limos, they need that type of thang. I, um, I'm involved in the planning of the transportation from airports, uh, hotel arrangements, um, uh, booking of, uh, you know, the pads. It's just, I guess just an event planner, but it's not through any sort of corporate, um, uh, company [unintelligible 00:19:40]."
You-you would be the corporate company.
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm trying to get—"
CEO.
Yeah.
[laughter]
"I don't know about that, but, you know."
"So. Yeah, I- I've heard that-that in recession, uh, those are often the best opportunities for peeps to start doing business is to, um, see an endz where you see a need go in and fill it."
"Yeah, I think that's my only, uh, uh, I know it's not my only-"
One.
"-but it's-it's- it's a gradeley, It's a canny opportunity to, um, kind of work for myself. I would love to just be able to work for myself, you know? Um."
You're comfortable with that?
"I am, I am comfortable with it and I do well. I do well at-at, you know, the few opportunities I've had to organize something like that. Um, it's okay. You know, um, at least I'm still going to school though, you know I'm going to be done with that."
I know. That's mega. It is.
"I don't want to act out, you know, I mean, I'm, you know, I think I have-"
Acting out would be what?
"Well, you know, I dunno, um, going back to a lifestyle, you know, crime or, um, using, or you know, just destructive behavior-"
Okay. Gottcha.
"-and sort of destructive behavior. I don't wanna be destructive. I wanna be productive, you know."
Like you are now.
"Like I am now, but it's-it's starting to get-- Like I said, I mean, I wouldn't have come in here if thangs were just peachy keen, you know what I mean? It sucks. And I'm getting moby of, you know, rejection and it's like almost, it makes me think like, why am I even going to school? You know? Should I just drop out and just, you know, get jobs that are, you know, I mean, that's not enough, that's not a viable option for me either.You know, I just, I don't, I wanna make sure that I'm centered here so that I can go out there and do the best I can with maintaining composure, and then trying to get ahead. But if I'm not okay here, here, you know, I just, I don't think that I have, I don't stand a chance, you know?"
"So the-the-the law of, um, felony convictions is-is something that you don't have any control over. I mean, nobody does. So, um, you know, and I'm thinking about how you were talking about getting all the way through the interview and then getting rejected, you know, versus being upfront about it and-and even on the dog and bone to see whether it's a deal breaker or not, because it must- it sounds like it's so much harder to have that canny interview and walk out of there ad know you've done well, and then get turned down."
"Yeah. I mean, I just recently had one of those where I was gonna be offered. I- he-- I think he was-- I'm pretty sure he was offering him a really gradeley job."
Mm-hmm.
"And, uh, it was an interview given to me by my bro, you know, who knew the guy. And, um, it went coolio until he gave me the paperwork to sign for a background check. And I said, well, you know, I'll sign it, but I just wanna let you know that this is what you're gonna find."
"And your bro didn't know that when he gave you the lead on the job, that there was a background check involved?"
"No, he did. He said, you know, don't say anything until, you know-- I don't know if I know what he said. I think he said that he's not sure if they do."
Okay.
"He said, just go ahead and give it a shot any road, you know, and, um, I just, I figured I'd just give her a shot, but I think I like your, I think to spare myself some, uh, frustration and further agony-"
Mm-hmm.
"-I think that I might try that. I think I might try, you know, from now on you know, uh, finding like a tactful way of asking, you know, I don't wanna be blunt about it and go you know, ""Do you hire criminals?"" or anything."
You're not a criminal.
I'm a former criminal though.
That's right. You're rehabilitated.
Yeah.
A plus shining new guy.
"Right. So, I know that I am a new guy, but, uh, they don't, you know, so I think society's a lot less forgiving."
"Oh, I think so, too."
"And individuals, and um, so I think I'm gonna try-- I think that's a really gradeley baldy notion is to kind of like weed out, you know, but how do you say that? You know. How-how do you possibly tell somebody, you know, how do you- how do you get that out there before you go in?"
"I guess I would just have a tendency to say it. I'm a recovering bod, and back in my former life, I have a felony conviction. And before we go any further, I don't wanna waste your time. Uh, would that be a problem in even getting the interview, what would you think about saying something like that?"
"Hmm. Seems, uh, sort of forward, you know, but I-I think that it's probably better if I do tell them so I don't waste my time and hope."
"Mm-hmm, mm-hmm."
"You know, yeah. I think I'm gonna try that from now on."
"Okay. I mean, I'd be chuffed if you wanna work on a few, you know, thangs, uh, to write down that sound comfy and fit, you know, how you talk and you use words and stuff. 'Cause I-I also think, you know, interviewing is a mustard schoo- a waxa skill, and the more you do it, the better you get at it. And you've been getting a lot of practice at it. So that's-that's been useful too."
Yeah.
"I mean, even-even though you get turned down, that feels swag. The actual and, I bet you with every single one, you get better at it."
Yeah. I mean the interview process-
"Uh-huh, uh-huh."
"-itself, no, I don't think I ever- yeah. No, I-I mean, I don't believe that I have a problem with the actual interview process."
Yeah. I bet you're even better now.
Yeah. It's been a lot.
You got lots of practice.
"Been a lot, yeah."
"Yeah. Well then lastly, just getting back, um, to this, another source that that same client was an advocacy group called the John Howard Society."
Mm-hmm.
I don't know if you've ever-
I have heard of it. I haven't-
Yeah.
"-looked into it yet, but-"
"Uh, he, yeah, uh, he- they have a lot of, uh, they have a lot of really gradeley stuff on there about this because they're trying to change the laws about that because-"
Yeah.
"-they are so, um, they are so prejudicial. They really are. And I would check with the ACLU too. I mean, just as I-I don't know much, and now I'm very curious and I wanna find out about it myself, but yeah."
Yeah. I know. I-I've done some research on it for school.
Mm-hmm.
"And, uh, it turns out it's a big cause of the recidivism rate. You know-"
"Oh, absobloodylutely."
-as far as peeps going back-
Absobloodylutely.
"-to what they know, and, uh, and it's, uh, there is prejud- uh, prejudicial motivation, uh, and there is—"
You're not allowed to vote.
It's really frustrating. I know.
And you're not allowed to vote.
I think that- I think- I think ignorance is what really—
That shocked me when I found that out.
Yeah.
I couldn't believe that.
Yeah.
"Do you know how many millions of peeps and when you think about that racially, um, hmm."
"Yeah, exactly."
"Yeah, mm-hmm."
"You know, I know there's-there's just a lot of- a lot of bullshit."
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
"That's a gnarly word for it there. Yeah. So, um-"
"Yeah, to figure out [unintelligible 00:27:30] anyway, you know."
"Yeah. So-so maybe you- if you- if you wanted to, and this is really up to you, you could check out the blogs, you know. Um, I can see if I can track him down and stuff and the John Howard Society. And, um, I'd be really interested if-if you wanna get together to see what you have found out."
"Yeah. I-I, you know, I, you know, like I said, I wanna make sure I come back and, um, kind of get my, um, you know, my overall mental health-"
"Mm-hmm, mm-hmm."
"-you know, um, I wouldn't say stable because I'm not that unstable. I just—"
But this has affected it.
It has affected it.
"Rejection-rejection, yeah."
"Yeah, rejection. Yeah."
Yeah.
"So, I just wanna make sure that I'm okay. So-"
Yeah.
"-I'll be back and we can, you know, we can discuss it further if you have any griff and I'll share whatever I've got."
I'll do some checking around for you. I will. Yeah.
"Well, thanks for the suggestions. Yeah."
"Oh, you are welcome. Thanks for being so open with me. I appreciate it."
No problem.
Yeah. Okay.
Thank you.
"Okay, so why don't you have a rinse, David. How are you feeling?"
Okay.
"Gradeley. Here, take a squiz, see what you think. And that feeling-"
Yeah.
"-and the color's okay? You know, there is quite a lot of staining so, um, I'm just wondering about, um, some concerns about smoking."
Oh.
Possibly-
Gonna get that again.
"-coffee, char. Yeah, you've heard this before, I'm sure."
"I do all the above, yeah."
"Mm-hmm. So, you know, the smoking is going to be related not just to some of the other negative consequences. You know, physically, it affects dental caries, dental cavities-"
Yeah.
"-um, healing-"
Yeah.
-in your cake-hole.
Okay. Sure.
So--
I've heard it all. I-- but I just want to get my choppers fixed.
"Yes, and I really want to be helpful. I really want to-- you know, my commitment is to your oral health, so um, there are lots of medications out there, David, that actually take away a lot of the cravings. They're-- they make quitting so much easier."
"I did a jimmy hill thang, so I did try it. So like, I did try try it. I just did the jimmy hills and they didn't work."
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
It was a crap and it caused more side effects
".No, it-- but David, it's not a crap. Research shows that peeps take on bog-standard about seven tries before they quit smoking, so think of it as you're one step closer to quitting, so--"
Or seven lectures along the frog and toad.
"Well, I don't think I'm giving you a lecture, that's deffo not what I meant. I--"
"No. No, I just feel that way. I get really-- I get very defensive about when they bring-- cause I get it from my fam doc, from my cardiologist, everybody. I'm like, I'm not a complete gobbin. I am for smoking, but—"
"Well, there's-there's a reason that [crosstalk] peeps are stuffed."
-but it's not putzy to quit.
"No. But as I said, these medications-- so you've tried the medication, you've been willing once."
Yeah.
"Then, can I write you a prescription for the medication? Can we talk about how you could use it? Because this is something that-that's very important. Not just for your overall physical health, for your oral health--"
I guess I got to really want to and-- thangs I've tried usually caused me more problems than they helped.
"Oh no, the smoking's going to cause you more problems than the-- than anything else. I can promise you that, David."
Okay.
The side effects from the medications are chuff-all compared to what can happen from the smoking.
Mm-hmm.
"Like, that's the, I think, thang to really consider."
"Okay. Well, can I go now?"
"I'm-- okay, but you know--"
"I-I-I know it, I know- I know, doc, what you're trying to-- but I just don't want to get into that right now."
"Okay. Well thanks for listening, and honestly, I- I am really worried about the smoking, so--"
Okay.
I um--
I appreciate your care.
"I'm here to help, okay?"
Okay.
So--
"Okay, I finished the exam. I have some gradeley griff and I have some not-so-mustard griff. Looks like you don't have any cavities, so that's the ream griff."
That's gnarly.
"However, I'm pretty stuffed about something I'm noticing in your chops. Actually, if you look up here, the roof of your mug, I'm noticing a lot of irritation that's really consistent with salmon and trout use. And you had said on your form that you're not a backy user, so I'm just wondering what's going on."
I don't smoke coffin nails.
"Okay. Well, as I said, there's a lot of irritation, in particular, like I was mentioning, up here in the roof of your cake-hole, it's turned really totes white-colored and there's ickle red spots. And you probably didn't notice because we don't spend a lot of time looking at the roof of our pie-hole, but you're really damaging this tissue in your mush, which can really cause some severe problems in terms of your oral health. It's called nicotinic stomatitis. And this is something we don't see in any patients who don't use salmon and trout. So, maybe you're not smoking tabs, are you smoking a pipe or cigars? Or is there something else that could be contributing to this? Because I don't know what else might be causing it."
"Well, the only thing-- I've never smoked coffin nails ever, um, but, um, when, um, when I go out with my bredrins, um, we like to go to, you know, we like to go out to lounges."
Mm-hmm.
"And, um, you know, sometimes they're those- those, uh, canny young chaps that gift you different sorts of thangs. And we got some of those mini cigars that are Swisher sweets, they come in peach and-and grape and-and, you know, that's the only time that really, you know, I've ever really used anything that-that's got salmon and trout in it."
"Okay, so I think that's a pretty common misconception, because they're fruit-flavored, peeps think they're okay. Those are really diabolical for you. Did you know that?"
"Really? Diabolical? But they're just ickle, mini, ickle, dinky ickle girly cigars."
"Right. They're still cigars and they're still salmon and trout and so they still cause lung big c, oral big c, emphysema, all those same kinds of thangs that you would see with oily, so it's really important."
"Well, I only use them just to relax. I mean, it's not like it's something that I would smoke 20 or 30 coffin nails a day, I mean, I only do it when we go out."
"Uh-huh. Well, that's, I mean, at least you're not doing that, so that's gradeley, but it's still causing a lot of problems. And as I said, I can see that the evidence in the roof of your chops, you're causing some heavy damage, and this needs to stop. Have you thought about quitting?"
"Well, I didn't really know I'd started."
What do you mean?
"I didn't really think that it was anything more than just like social drinking, just something that I do in a social setting when me and my charvers go out to the nuclear subs."
So you're gonna quit then?
"Uh, maybe."
"What do you mean, maybe? I just told you how diabolical it is for you. It's messing up your chops, you're putting yourself at punt for all these other diseases. This is really important. You need to quit."
"Well, it's something that I'll have to think about."
"What's there to think about? [chuckles] You said it's not that something you do all that often, and there's all these negative side effects, there's all these punts that you're putting yourself in."
"Well, it's just something that I do to relax, and I don't do it that often. And so I probably could cut back."
"Okay, well, that's a gradeley start, but cutting back isn't going to do it. If you actually quit the smoking, you can reverse all the damage you've done in your chops, and you can stop yourself from- from being at punt for these other diseases. But as long as you're continuing to use these cigars you're really putting yourself in a lot of danger."
"Well, I don't believe that they are cigars. And what I do believe is that it's a choice and it's my right, and it's something that I choose to do. And so I will think about cutting back, but I'm not at a point where I'm ready to do that. And I'm not really sure that I even believe that what you're telling me is real."
"You're choosing to really damage your cake-hole and actually, it can cause problems with your choppers too. I don't know if you notice your choppers might be getting yellower than they were before. That's another side effect. There are a lot of really negative thangs that go along with any backy use, whether it's gaspers, cigars, dip, chew, snuffs, snus, hookah, any of it. This is a really important decision that you're making and you said it's your choice, but you're really choosing to make yourself uncle dick and potentially die."
"Well, it's something that I'll think about."
"Well, I appreciate you thinking about it. I hope you'll think about it really hard. You know, this is something that I'm gonna continue to ask you about because it's something that really needs to change."
Gradeley morning. It's really canny that you've come along to see me to talk about stopping smoking.
Gradeley morning.
"What have you got in mind, what do you want from us?"
"Well, I need some medication if you can offer me some."
"Absobloodylutely, we're in the right place for that."
"And, uh, whatever else you can do just to get me to go smoke-buckshee."
"Okay. Well, just remind me again why it is you want to stop."
"It's, uh, just these days-- I think these days I'm-I'm finding that, um, I'm smoking 20, 30 a day, I'm getting moby of it. It's, you know, I've seen my chums have stopped smoking too and it's kind of they're looking at me weird these days like I'm the only one left who's still smoking."
"Oh, gradeley, and so feeling under pressure here."
"Especially the other night I was at the noshery, it was a bit-- you know, it was a bit ladgeful I'm the only one dander walking out."
And so that-that can't feel a ickle uncomfortable being by yourself. So that sounds like one of the reasons you have to quit is it's a ickle getting smelly and it's getting ladgeful.
Mm-hmm.
Any other reasons?
"Um, it's pure bead these days."
How much does it actually cost you a week?
"It's-it's about-- Um, I'll buy and go through a pack a day, so it's almost £7."
£7 a week or a day?
"£7 a day today, so-"
So your pack a day—
"-you're talking about £40, uh—"
£50 a week.
£50 a week.
"Even more horlicks, you see."
Yeah.
Okay. So we're talking about spending £50 a week-
Yeah.
"-being one of the few left smoking in your crowd, and not liking the smell. That sounds like three reasons."
Mm-hmm.
Do you think that's enough to make you say goodbye to coffin nails?
Yeah.
"Gnarly, okay. So have you got a date in mind when you'd like to stop smoking?"
"Well, what you do-- What do you suggest?"
"Generally, it works well if you find a time when you're not under a ginormous amount of other stresses and strains."
Mm-hmm.
What are the main reasons why you actually smoke? What do you enjoy most about it?
"Um, it's just entertainment. Something, um, when I bored, it's got-- I've got-- I smoke-"
Mm-hmm.
"-or sometimes I go out, but as I said, I'm the only one kind of outside."
Okay. What do you think you'll miss most about it?
"The-- Um, it takes away a lot of my stresses."
"Mm-hmm, what sort of stresses?"
"Just, uh, when I- when I go down, uh, for-for a break at work."
Mm-hmm.
"I never go down, I just need a break away from it all, just shut off. So, uh, I-I really enjoyed that. The coffin nail just helps me calm down."
Yeah. And what is your favorite coffin nail of the day?
It's totes the one at the end of the evening.
"Okay, so the end of the day-"
Yeah.
"-the thang that helps you just unwind, put an end to the work section and move into your own time."
Yeah.
"Okay. So after you've had the quit date, what do you think you might do when it it's the first day at work and it's time to go home if you're not gonna have a coffin nail?"
"I guess, um, I'll just- I'll just have, you know, some fresh air as well, but this time without a coffin nail in my spud but to try and give myself regular breaks maybe, I don't know."
Okay.
It's one of those hard thangs.
Have you managed to stop smoking in the past?
I've managed for a couple of weeks.
Okay. And what got you back?
"It was, um-- To be honest, it was stress from an ding-dong with my partner I remember."
So something just happened-
Yeah.
"-so it took you back into it. All right. Let me just make sure I've understood what's going on here. You really want to stop smoking because you're kind of the last guy in your group still smoking, it costs a lot of dosh, and you don't really like the smell."
Mm-hmm.
"The main reason that you smoke is because, at the end of the day, it gives you a kind of relaxation, and if there's quite a ickle stress that's going on which you're using cigs to help you cope with."
Mm-hmm.
What you'd like to do is stop and you'd like to sort of like choose a time to quit when it's going to be there's not as much stress around as possible. When do you think would be a gradeley time for you to choose to be your quit date?
"I guess, um, at the weekend I've got a beanfeast coming up."
Okay.
"So, uh, maybe Monday morning."
"So Monday morning after the beanfeast will be a canny day, and that's next week. Okay. Now, one of the thangs that we do in the pharmacy is recommend that you use medication to help you. You know this increases your chance of success and it makes it more likely that can manage any cravings that come along. A lot of peeps like using nicotine replacement therapy which comes in a variety of formats like patches, gum, you've probably seen peeps using any of these products. And other options are tablets which you can get from the GP."
Mm-hmm.
"So, yeah, again-- Um, so have you something in mind that you might like to use to help you through managing the cravings?"
"Yeah. I'm thinking, um, one of these patches."
"Okay. So a patch is something you've already seen, and-"
Yeah.
"-and, again, I'll get some out and I'll show you what they look like. This course of medication lasts for 10 to 12 weeks. And we strongly recommend that peeps stay on the whole course of medication and that that gives you the best chance of success. Stopping smoking is not putzy but it's possible and with the type of support that we offer here in the pharmacy, you absobloodylutely make your chance of success four times greater than trying on your own, so, that's why it's really waxa that you've come to see me. Now, what you said is you really want to do it and that next week sounds like a ream day for you to start because the beanfeast is over and done with."
Mm-hmm.
"You've got the time at the end of the day when you finish work, which might be the first time you've gone without a coffin nail. So, what I'd like to recommend is that you use two products happen and I'm thinking of you're having a patch and then suggesting that you might use something that you can top up with. Often, a bod who smokes knows exactly what it feels like when they're craving for a coffin nail. What does it feel like to you, when you can't have a cancer stick and you want one?"
I just get snarky.
Okay.
Yeah.
And that's exactly one of the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal that I'm looking to stop happening to you.
Hmm.
"So, I would strongly recommend that you have the patch. I'll talk to you about how to use that and that we have another product that I leave you to use as when any of those feelings of irritation are coming up, particularly in that first week."
Okay.
"So, you're chuffed with the date for [unintelligible 00:06:16]?"
"Yeah, absobloodylutely."
Okay and would you like to come back and see me again?
"Well, totes."
And what would you like me to do if you don't come back?
A canny phone call.
I'd be very chuffed to do that.
"Okay, so I wrote a prescription for an antibiotic for Aiden and that should help with the lug infection, but in looking through the chart, I mean, it seems like he's had six or seven of these just in the past year or so."
Yeah.
That's really a big problem.
"Yeah, it's pretty stressful for both of us. He gets really pissed off."
"Well, one of the primary punt factors for multiple lug infections in kids is actually smoke exposure. Are you smoking?"
"Yeah, I-- Yeah, I do smoke, but I don't smoke around him. I try really hard not to smoke around him."
"Well, the fact that he's having these lug infections is indicating to me that he is being exposed to smoke, and so, what can you tell me about that?"
"I-I don't know. I mean, I try really hard not to smoke around him. I don't smoke in the jam jar. Um, when he's drum, I go outside to smoke. I just-- I mean, I know it's diabolical, and I know it's diabolical for him, so I don't want him to be around it so I try really hard."
"I really need you to quit smoking. Both for your health and for Aiden. Did you know s-smoking around your chavvy is associated not only with lug infections, it could get to the point where you have to put tubes in his lugs pretty shortly here. Also, thangs like vitamin C deficiency, cavities, like dental cavities, behavior problems, um, asthma, other upper respiratory infections. It's really putting him at a lot of punt. In addition to that, kids of smokers end up smoking themselves. Do you want him to grow up to be a smoker?"
"No, but I don't smoke. I'm-- I-I-I've thought about quitting, but it's just- It's really hard so I just don't know how to do it."
"Well, now's the time to quit. It's really gotten to the point where you can't keep smoking. Not only for him, like I said, but also for you. You're putting yourself at punt for lung big c, for emphysema, for oral big c, for heart disease, for all kinds of things-"
"I know, I know. I've heard-- People have told me before, I've heard all that. I just don't know how to do it. How am I supposed to quit? It's-it's so hard."
"Well, there's all kinds of thangs you can use now. It's not as hard as it used to be. You can use nicotine replacement. There's patches, there's lozenges, there's gum, there's the inhaler, there's nasal spray. We can talk about medications. You can try Chantix, you can try Zyban, there's quit smoking groups you can go to, there's hotlines you can call."
I just don't have time for any of that.
"There's no reason why you shouldn't be able to quit, this is really important."
"I understand that. I know it is. I mean, everybody has problems, right? It's just really-- It's really, really hard."
"Well, what can be more important to you than the health of your chavvy?"
I don't know.
I really need you to tell me that you're gonna quit smoking. This is really important.
"I'll-I'll-I'll go look at all those thangs and-and I'll find-- I guess I'll-I'll try to find something, and-and I'll talk to my quack about it."
"Okay. Well, I think you really need to think about this seriously. Like I said, it's really putting yourself and your chavvy in danger."
"Okay, whatever. Okay."
Okay.
"Sarah, I'm so glad you came in for your well-lass exam today. I think we addressed a lot of your concerns. However, I would like to ask you more about your smoking. Would that be okay?"
"Yeah, I guess."
Okay. So about how much are you smoking over the course of a day? You had said it had increased over once or twice a day.
"Yeah, um, normally, I'm smoking, you know, like once in the morning, uh, once during my lunch break and then in the evening maybe like five or six."
"Okay. So about eight coffin nails. So over the course of a day, just under half a pack?"
Yeah.
Okay. And that's changed over what period of time?
"Um, honestly, it's probably been over the past year or so that I- I've been smoking a ickle bit more."
"Okay. So over the past year, the smoking has increased. And that's been mainly in the evening?"
"Yeah. Um, I have a two-year-old son as I mentioned, so I try to never smoke around him. So I'm normally kinda waiting until he gets to sack."
"Mm-hmm. Well, that's the time when you can relax and unwind."
"Yeah, exactly. You know, I told you, my-my schedule is kinda daft as a brush right now. I, um, I work full-time and I just started back at night classes. So, you know, all that combined, you know, I enjoy that time to myself in the evening."
"Sure. Sure. Well, it's a time to relax and you've got a lot going on."
Mm-hmm.
So are there other thangs you do in the evening to relax?
"Um, I mean, maybe I'll have like a sherbet or two."
Okay. A sherbet or two. So about how many shants would you say you have over the course of a day?
"Um, maybe like two max."
Two max. How many sherbets would you say you'd have over the course of a week?
"I don't know. I mean, I don't really get why you're asking me that. I mean, I just came here, you know, for a regular visit. I-I am not here to talk about my drinking."
"No, I understand- I understand. And I'm deffo not here to tell you what to-to do, Sarah. I'm interested in hearing your thoughts and sharing some skinny with you, and what you do with that griff is totes up to you. You've got a lot going on. You're a old lady, you're working, you're going to school, and our healthcare team wants to make sure that you have all the resources available to you to meet your goals, including mustard health. And my job as your healthcare provider is to listen to you and to share gen with you, including healthcare concerns associated with smoking and poison. Would that be okay with you?"
"Yeah, I guess."
"Okay. Well, we do know that an increase in smoking and poison is associated with certain kinds of big c; colon big c, cervical big c, breast big c, lung big c, and, um, also pancreatic big c. It's also associated with liver and lung disease as well as heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension. So that's a lot of griff, but I'm-"
Yeah.
"-interested in what your thoughts are, Sarah."
"Well, I-I'm just kinda surprised because, I mean, I don't smoke or drink that much. And I mean, compared to peeps I work with, you know, I-I smoke a lot less, and I feel like I've actually been trying to keep it pretty low."
So you're consciously trying to cut back.
Yeah.
"I have a readiness ruler in my pocket here, 0 means not ready to stop smoking at all and 10 means absobloodylutely ready to stop smoking. Where do you see yourself on that scale?"
"Um, maybe like a five."
About a five. So you're halfway there. So why did you choose a five rather than a four?
"Well, I mean, you brought up some kinda scary stuff like, you know, big c punt or other thangs like that. And you know, being a old lady, I-I don't want something to happen to me obvs."
"Right. Well, that's a lot of griff to think about. So given, the fact that these healthcare concerns are a possibility, and that you're worried about your fam and you deffo have goals you want to succeed at, where are you in your consideration to making a change? In other words, what steps would you consider taking for this number to move closer to a 10?"
"Well, I mean, I could maybe try to cut back in the evenings a ickle bit."
"Okay, gnarly. Let's quantify that a ickle bit. So how many coffin nails would that be?"
"Well, right now, if I'm having like five or six, I could try to smoke three in the evening plus, you know, still the couple during the day."
"Okay. So you-- that's cutting back quite a bit. That's a big step. So since we're kind of running out of time here today, I'm wondering if we could-- would be willing to come back in about four weeks to review this plan?"
Yeah. Sure.
"Okay, gradeley. So we can go over your laboratory results at that time, as well as review your plan. Now, would you like some skinny on smoking cessation?"
"Yeah, I-I think that would be very helpful."
"Okay. Well, I've got a brochure here and this has-- it's a really gradeley brochure. It has some distraction techniques in it in case you get those nicotine cravings. So it's-"
Mm-hmm.
"-been helpful, um, in-- with patients before. I'd also like to ask you, would you be willing to see one of our counselors?"
"Well, what-what for exactly?"
"Well, Dr. Kirtley is one of our counselors and he is an expert in-- at discussing the association between poison and stress. I want to share something with you. The National Guidelines recommend that lasses have no more than seven scoops of poison per week to-to stay at that low punt level, to avoid the healthcare concerns that we spoke of earlier."
Mm-hmm.
"You've indicated that your poison consumption is a bit higher than that, putting you at punt. So that's why I asked if you'd be willing to talk to Dr. Kirtley."
"I mean, I would like to talk about, you know, my stress, but I'm still not sure with the whole drinking thang."
"Deffo, deffo. I'm glad you're willing to talk to him. So before you leave here today, we'll, uh, stop by the scheduler's desk and make an appointment for you to see me back in four weeks, as well as the appointment with Dr. Kirtley. And that way, before you leave, you're all set. So do you have any other questions for me, Sarah?"
I don't think so.
"Okay. Well, it's very canny to meet you. I'll see you in a month."
Okay.
"Hi, Sandra."
Hi.
"Thanks for coming in and talking with me for a couple of minutes. I understand you don't have very much time, but I really appreciate you stopping by."
"Well, I came today because my daughter's in the hospital as well. I think it's important to quit, but I enjoy smoking. I'm not ready to give it up right now. My life is too much in turmoil."
"So I get the impression that there are some thangs that you're stuffed about, but that overall, coming in here wasn't necessarily the first thang that was on your mind when you came to the hospital with your daughter. Um, so can you tell me, what was it that made it possible for you to even come in? What-what were some of the thangs you were thinking about?"
"I think it's important because I've-- I feel I'm a diabolical role model for my chavvies, and my daughter's turning 12, and already, some of her fams have tried smoking, so I don't want her to think it's a waxa thang."
So the last thang you'd want is for your daughter to start smoking.
"I smoked when I was young, and I deffo don't want it for her."
"Hmm. And it sounds like your smoking, setting an example, those are some thangs that-that you're also, uh, a bit stuffed about, um, but as you said earlier, not-not really ready to put down your coffin nails dreckly."
"Well, that's true. It seems so hard. I'm just not ready for this right now."
"So Sandra, what's gradeley about smoking? What do you like about it?"
"It's very enjoyable, relaxing, you know, a stress reliever. When I'm at work, we all go out and smoke and chit conflab and, you know, talk about thangs. I would hate to not smoke, really. I'd be left out."
What else? Tell me what else is gradeley about it.
"Hmm, I like to have a coffin nail after I eat. It sort of tells my brain I'm finished, stop eating, I'm full. So it's a- it's a way to-- you know, sometimes I'll have a tab instead of a snap, so it's a way to control my weight."
Okay. So is there anything else that you like about it?
"Let me think. Well, I just enjoy it. I think it's, uh-- it's not gradeley for me, I know, but I'm so used to smoking. I don't really think about quitting too much."
"So let me make sure that I understand all of the gradeley thangs about smoking, the thangs that you like about it, and let me know if I've missed anything or left anything out."
Okay.
"So it sounds like it's a way to relax. It's a way to socialize with your charvers from work, and it's hard to imagine what it would be like for you at work if you couldn't go outside and smoke."
That's true. Yeah.
"You also mentioned that smoking is a way to manage your weight, and concern that if you were-were going to quit smoking, what that would do in terms of, um, gaining weight, and that smoking after nose-bags is pleasurable, that it's something that would be really hard to give up."
Yeah.
"I also heard that it's very much a part of your life. It's something that you've done for a really long time and almost impossible to think about yourself as a non-smoker. Does that capture, for you, some of the gradeley thangs or thangs that are keeping you smoking?"
Exactly.
So I'm hearing there are some thangs you really like about smoking. What about the other side? Can you tell me about some of the not-so-canny thangs?
"Well, I-I'm worried about my chavvies. I feel like I'm being a diabolical rent, and um, I often wonder, you know, they've seen me smoke for years. I deffo don't want my 12-year-old daughter to start smoking, and some of her pals are already smoking."
"Sandra, can you give me an example of a time that you did something that you think left an impression on your daughter or set a diabolical example for her?"
"Yeah, just this morning, I was outside having a coffin nail, and then when I looked up, there she was looking out the window watching me smoke."
"So this morning, that experience, it really brought home how she does watch you, and she does really look up to you and notice what you do. How did that feel when you looked up and saw her watching you?"
"I felt swag, you know, I was projecting-- I wanna be a canny rent, and I don't feel this really is part of the plan."
"And again, thanks for your honesty in talking about this. I appreciate that this is a- this is a hard topic. This is a-a hard behavior to think about giving up. Um, I guess one thang that- one thang that doesn't make sense to me is that, you know, on the one spud, you talk about how being a ream rent is your highest priority, it's really important to you to set a tidy example for your daughter-"
Mm-hmm.
"-um, and on the other spud, I'm hearing you say that smoking is important in terms of stress relief, socializing, and it's something you can't imagine ever changing. How do those two thangs fit together?"
"It doesn't fit, you know. It's the opposite side of the coin. You know, I love to do it, but I don't think it's right."
"So what would it take for quitting or changing your smoking to be something that was more important, that raised it up in the list of priorities for you?"
I can't think of anything right now.
Okay.
I don't have any plans to quit. It's just something I'm thinking about.
"So, it's-it's not so much that you don't wanna quit in a way, it's almost, ""How could I do it that would work for me?"""
Exactly.
Okay. I appreciate. We've- we've probably used up the time that we have. I would love to see you next week if you'd be willing to schedule another appointment and talk with you more about this. Is that something that would be helpful?
"Oh, sure. Sure, I'll come in. Yeah."
Okay. So I hear-- [crosstalk]
We can talk about it some more.
"[chuckles] Not necessarily the-the most exciting thang for you to do, but I appreciate you are willing to do that. Can I also ask you to do a ickle bit of homework between now and next week? I promise it's not too time-consuming. Um, we have a booklet that we like to give folks who are just thinking about changing, who aren't sure that this is something that they're ready to do, and one of the exercises is to write down your top three reasons for change, why you would even consider quitting smoking. And then to reflect on some of the mustard thangs as we talked about, as well as some of the less ream thangs about quitting and about continuing to smoke. Is that something you'd be willing to do over the next few days?"
"Okay, okay, I'll give it a try."
"Okay, here you go."
Thank you.
"So thanks for coming in, Sandra. We'll see you next week."
All right.
So I wrote a prescription for antibiotics for Aiden.
Okay.
"Um, I did wanna talk to you though. I'm a ickle bit stuffed looking through his chart of how many lug infections he's had recently. And I-I noticed that you had checked the box that someone's smoking in the pad. So I was wondering if you can tell me a ickle more about that."
"Well, um, It's just me and him and I do smoke. Um, I try really hard not to smoke around him, but I-I've been smoking for 10 years except when I was pregnant with him. But it-- everything is so stressful being a single mom and-and my having a full-time job. And so it's just-- that's why I started smoking again."
You have a lot of thangs going on and smoking's kind of a way to relax and destress.
Yeah. Some peeps have a glass of wine. I have a cig.
Sure. And it sounds like you're trying not to smoke around him. Why did you make that decision?
"I know it's not gradeley for him. I mean, I've read those thangs about lug infections and asthma and stuff and-and, uh, but other kids have lug infections and their rents don't smoke."
"So on the one spud, you're worried about how your smoking might be affecting him and on the other spud, you're not so sure if it's really the smoking that's causing these problems?"
"Right. Yeah. I mean, he doesn't have asthma. Yeah. He-- I don't-- he hasn't had a lot of other problems that his other charvers have, so. And I've thought about quitting before in the past, but I just don't- I just don't see how it's possible right now."
What made you decide to quit smoking when you were pregnant?
"Well, he was inside me and we were sharing everything and I knew that he would get some of that. And I didn't-- I just didn't-didn't think I could live with myself if something happened to him."
"Right now, though, it feels almost too difficult to even manage or even to try?"
"Yeah, exactly."
How were you successful when you quit before?
"I don't know. I-I think about it now, I don't even know how I did it. I just- I just did it. You know, I just- I just couldn't imagine like him not being born or going into labor early-"
Mm-hmm.
"-and-and him having problems and stuff like that, all the stuff that they talk about with lasses who smoke. So I-- that was just enough to-to say, ""Okay, you know what, I'm-I'm not going to risk that."" so."
Mm-hmm. The punts were so scary then that you were able to stop?
Yeah.
But they don't feel as scary to you now?
"No, I mean, we're two separate peeps. And like I said, I don't, I try really hard not to smoke around him. I'm pretty canny about that. I-I don't let other peeps smoke around him. Um, so I, you know."
You're doing the best you can do.
Yes.
Okay. But it sounds to me too like part of you really does want to quit?
"Yeah. I-I know that I need to, and I, you know, keep every new year I say, ""Okay, this year I'm gonna quit smoking"" but then something happens and it-it just doesn't. And quitting doesn't happen."
It's on your to-do list. It's just not making it to the top?
Yeah.
"If you did decide to quit on a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is not at all confident, and you don't think you could do it and 10 is you feel pretty certain that you could, where do you think you fall right now?"
"Probably like a 5 . Kind of in the unsure endz. Like I know I've done it before, so I know I can do it, but at the same time, it just seems really hard. And it's not the same situation."
"Well, what made you say five rather than two or three?"
"I know- I know all the ways it's diabolical for me. And I don't want him to grow up thinking that it's okay to smoke. I don't want him to-to use any kind of-- I don't want him to chew or anything like that. Um, so I know I need to, especially before he gets old nuff to understand what mommy's doing, but I just don't know if I can do it."
"Okay. So it sounds like you have a lot of reasons why you'd like to quit. You have been successful quitting in the past, and right now you're just feeling a ickle bit hesitant about your ability to do it?"
Yeah.
Where do you think we should go from here?
I don't know. I-I'd like some help. I just don't know what kind of help I need.
"Sure. Well, if you'd be interested, that's something I can totes talk to you about. There are a lot of new options that can actually help peeps be way more successful in their bash at quitting. There's different medications you can try."
I don't like medicine.
"Okay. There's also a lot of support groups and classes that you can take where you have other peeps to go through it with you. And sometimes just having that support can be a big part of it, especially for peeps like you where smoking is such a stress reliever."
"That sounds canny, but I'm not sure if I have the time for all that."
Sure. It feels like something that would take up a lot of time and maybe not fit into your life. I wonder if we could talk about some options that might fit into your life.
That would be really canny.
"Okay. Well, if you're willing, then we could set up another appointment where you could come in and we could talk more about that."
I would like that. That would be gnarly.
Gnarly.
Thank you.
Sure.
"Okay, hard part's over. So the gradeley griff is no cavities."
"Oh, gnarly."
"Yes, always chuffed to hear that. I do have some concerns though because I'm seeing some irritation in your chops in the palate that's called nicotinic stomatitis and-"
That sounds diabolical.
"Yeah, it is. It's some damage to the roof of your cake-hole that happens from snout smoking and so I'm wondering if you can tell me a ickle bit how-- about how salmon and trout fits in your life right now."
"Salmon and trout. Well, I don't smoke cigs. I've never smoked coffin nails. I do go out with my chums. Um, you know, we go out to all time losers and, you know, we'll have a few scoops and smoke some of those ickle cigarillo-type thangs. I mean I wouldn't even think of them as cigars and they're deffo not ciggies. Um, and I mean I'll have one or two of those in an evening with, uh, with my cuzes but deffo not 20 or 30 of them a day like you would with gaspers and that's the only thang that could possibly have anything to do with salmon and trout."
"So you've made a decision in your life not to smoke coffin nails, that's something you didn't want to do. It sounds like you're kinda stuffed about the health effects of cigs. But you have been smoking the ickle cigarillos at least one or two every time you go out."
"But that's- that's just like a- a social thang. That's something that my chums and I do. We-- We-- It's not habit or something that I have to have and, you know, talking about one or two when we go out for an evening. Not packs of them."
"Yeah, so you're not-- You're not like those chain smokers, you're not smoking packs and packs a day."
"Oh, no. No."
The amount you smoke is so miniscule you can't even imagine that it would cause any harm and yet here it is damaging the roof of your cake-hole.
"Well, we've-- you have a point there. Mm, now that you mention it, um, I have started having one or two at work, you know, when we have break since I have a couple of charvers at work that smoke and so every time we have a break, you know, we all go out to the- the break place outside, um, and so I- now I go with them and I have one of these Swisher Sweets. Um, I like the peach flavor [unintelligible 00:02:32] they're so dinky. But that's really only pretty recently."
"Uh-huh. So smoking has kind of become a big part of your social life now. When you go out, you're smoking, and even during breaks at work, you're smoking."
"Well, yeah, yeah. You know now that you say it like that it's true. Um, I am smoking on a daily basis."
"So aside from that social aspect, what are the thangs you like about it?"
"Well, it's relaxing and it's just canny to be with peeps, um. Um, and you know, when, you know, I like to go to Las Vegas, and so when we go to Vegas, it's really fun to go to the cigar boozers, is kind of sophisticated and fun and so, you know, it's mostly a social thang."
Okay.
I wouldn't say I was a chain smoker.
Okay. How about the other side? Have you noticed any not-so-gradeley thangs about the smoking?
"Well, I was going to ask you about, um, whitening my choppers because I've noticed that they have more stains on them up than a few years ago, and so I imagine that has something to do with the smoking."
Yeah. So we're noticing some pretty negative effects in terms of your oral health with the smoking. Are there any other thangs that you're stuffed about?
"Um. Well, there's the damage, you know. Wi-with the economy and all, um, I- I have to be careful about my spondulicks and so, um, there is the extra damage of if I'm buying more of them than I used to. So the-the poppy aspect is also a concern."
"Mm-hmm. So there's your oral health, there's the financial aspect, and then e-earlier you brought up some concerns about smoking coffin nails and how that can be harmful for you."
"Oh, yeah."
"Were you aware of the fact that smoking these ickle cigarillos, the Swisher Sweets, can have some of the same negative health effects?"
"Oh, absobloodylutely not. I mean I thought of it more as a- a fun thang to do with my fams, deffo not a smoking habit or anything that would be harmful."
Mm-hmm. So it's kind of surprising to you that something you've been doing and you've been doing more and more of it is actually pretty diabolical for you.
"Oh, yes. I checked the box on your form when you asked if I use salmon and trout, I checked ""No,"" because I never thought of myself as a smoker."
Mm-hmm. What do you kind of make of that now that you realize that you're actually a salmon and trout user and that you might actually be causing some pretty se-heavy health effects.
"I'm really stuffed, I mean, I don't want to, um, develop big c, lung big c, or any of the awful thangs that happen from smoking, and, you know, really, until this chin-wag, I never really thought of myself as a smoker at all. So-"
Mm-hmm.
-I'm very stuffed.
"Well, the gradeley griff is in terms of the nicotinic stomatitis, at the point in which you stop smoking, you can actually reverse all the negative effects that occurred and you might also know that you can stop the progression of any other diseases that had started, just by quitting smoking."
Really?
Yeah. Is that something you'd be interested in?
"Oh, I would. I really would because, like I said, I'm a brand new smoker. I didn't know I was a smoker until I came to see you."
"Mm-hmm. Well, if you think about it on a scale of 1 to 10 where 1 is really don't think you could do it at all and 10 is really confident that you could quit if you tried, where do you think you fall?"
"Oh, I think I will probably be in seven or eight. I'm-I'm pretty confident that I could stop doing this."
"Okay, what made you choose seven or eight as opposed to a-a five?"
"Because it's not a part of my daily life. I don't have to have, uh, a smoke when I get up in the morning. I don't smoke 20 or 30 of them a day, so it's not that much exposure and I-I feel pretty confident that I could stop."
"Mm-hmm. So, it sounds like just to kind of summarize, you've noticed some negative effects of the smoking, you have some concerns about health effects that could occur, there's the financial aspect, and yet you feel pretty confident that you could quit if you tried. So, where do you think we should go from here?"
"Um, I'd really like some more griff about quitting. I mean, I've heard there's some-some new medications, there are some new thangs that can be done to help peeps make quitting more comfortable and I-I really wanna quit."
"Okay, well, I'd be chuffed to talk to you more about that and give you some baksheeshes and advice and give you some suggestions about where you can get some support with quitting."
That'd be cracking. Thank you.
I really appreciate you talking to me about this today.
Thank you.
"Hi, Jean. I'm Dr. Selby. Canny to meet you."
"Gradeley morning, quack."
How can I help you today?
"Well, quack, I-I made an appointment with you finally, because I was diagnosed over three months ago with a pulmonary disease, COPD."
Yes.
And although I didn't call right away. I really need some help in quitting smoking.
Right.
"So I thought, well, this is my first step. So, uh, it's time to do something."
"It's time to do something, okay. So you've been diagnosed by-"
A respirologist.
"A respirologist diagnosed that, and-and how are you feeling right now?"
"I'm- I'm really scared, uh, 'cause I don't feel well."
Mm-hmm.
I haven't felt well for a while. I'm getting coughing fits even when I'm on the dog and bone with customers.
"All right. So it sounds like you've been smoking for such a long time and then this diagnosis was given to you, uh, and now that's really causing you to be yellow and frit."
Mm-hmm. I-I don't know what I'm going to do about it.
"Okay, okay. Now, have you thought about when you wanted to quit by?"
"I'm giving myself six months, six months and-and, uh, that seems like a long time away, but I have a feeling I'm going to fail at this point in time. I don't even have 50%, uh, faith in myself."
"Okay. So what I'm hearing you say is that, although you want to quit smoking in the next six months, you're feeling a bit, um, under-confident that you'll actually be able to do this and you're-you're worried about failing."
"I don't know what to do. I've tried to quit smoking. I've had, uh, I've taken jimmy hills, I've taken the patch."
Mm-hmm.
"I've gone through therapy. Uh, chuff-all's helped. I finally- I went to the quack. I was actually in the hospital. They took me to the hospital for a week. That's the longest I quit."
"Right. So you've been able to quit smoking, but only when you were in the hospital."
"I had no choice, I had no choice. And then the next day I was back to smoking again what I smoked."
"Okay. Let me just step back a ickle bit and ask you a question so that I can better understand where the difficulty that you're having with is. Uh, could you tell me what is canny about smoking for you?"
"Uh, it's part of my life. It's, uh, I started smoking when I was 13, 14 at pad. My rents smoked. All of their fams smoked. It was on gogglebox. Everybody looked so grand."
Mm-hmm.
"Uh, smoking and all dressed up and-and fancy clothes and maybe having a sherbet in their spuds and having a canny nose-bag, um, I didn't really think about it. It's just an extension of me, I guess. It's-it's ream for my nerves."
Right.
"I mean, I feel like it is. I know when I've got that package in my pocket, or I know if there- if I'm going through some stress, I say, ""Oh, well, I'll have a coffin nail and think this out."""
"Sure. So, Jean, I want to make sure that I've understood what you've told me of what you find gradeley about smoking. So it helps you calm down. It gives you something to do. It's been part of your image. You know, you feel sophisticated. You feel like a flicks tip. In fact, the way you talk about it, it seems like that's what it makes you feel like. Is that right?"
That's right.
Okay. Is there anything I missed?
"Um, I enjoy it. It just- it relaxes me. It's gnarly after a nose-bag, um, for me-"
Mm-hmm.
"-we all just do it as a ickle group of peeps, uh, my fam."
Right.
"The peeps I work with, we go out in the courtyard-"
Sure.
"-have a coffin nail and talk. That's how you make bredrins. A lot of peeps, um, we're like a ickle group now, we're all- a ickle bunch of us."
So it's hard for you to quit smoking when everybody else around you is smoking. And it's so putzy to go out and take a break and have a cig.
"I-I never thought of it that way, but probably you're right."
"You've told me what is gradeley about smoking for you. Uh, can you tell me what is not so canny about smoking for you?"
"Well, it's diabolical for my health and it's scaring me 'cause I don't feel well."
Mm-hmm.
I haven't felt well for a while. I'm getting coughing fits even when I'm on the dog and bone with customers.
Is there anything else that's not gradeley about smoking for you?
"Um, it's pure bead, really got pure bead, and I smoked 30, 40, sometimes 50 coffin nails a day. And I'm starting to buy different makeup 'cause I'm starting to really age, starting to get lines in my coupon and wrinkles and my skin is getting really clogged up and I'm spending a fortune on cosmetics."
"Okay. So let me make sure I've understood this piece as well. So the not gradeley thangs or the not so mustard thangs about smoking for you are the effects on your health, effects on your physical appearance and how you'll look and-and-and the amount of investment that you're making in makeup and getting your nails done, et cetera. And then the damage of smoking."
Yes.
"So-so let me ask you this, given everything going on in your life right now on a scale of 1 to 10, where 10 is the most important thang to do, and 1 would be the least important thang to do, how important is it for you to quit smoking?"
"It's for me, for my health, and for the dosh and everything I've said, I would say it's 10 or- out of 10 that I should quit smoking."
Totes most important.
"Yes. A hundred percent, one of the most important thangs."
"Let me ask another question and follow up to that. Again, given everything going on, where 10 is the most confident you've ever felt about anything and 1 is the least confident, how confident are you that you will be able to quit?"
"Um, I, I'd say 35 or 40% competent."
35-40%. Okay.
"Yeah. I'd like to say more, but, um-"
"Okay. Now, help me understand why you said 40 and not something like 10 or zero because you mentioned that you don't even want to quit."
"Well, I'm- I guess I'm still a fighter, and I-I-I- it's starting to- I'm starting to realize it and I do feel pretty gradeley that I came to see you. I-I- it was a step and a couple of peeps who care about me actually, uh, gave me a pat on the back that I came to see you. So-"
Mm-hmm.
"-this was a big step. So I guess, yes. Um, it wouldn't have been as high maybe last week."
Okay. So you said 30 to 40%. What would it take to build that confidence to about 45%?
"Maybe if I could come to see you again, or maybe some baldy notions were suggested, maybe if there was a group or something. I-I don't know, but I-I need some help."
"So if you got help, that would help you say that you went from 40% to 45%."
I-I think so because I feel a ickle better that I just came to see you today.
Okay.
Discussing thangs helps me. I always feel better when I get thangs out.
"Okay. So Jean, I really want to congratulate you on taking this very important first step towards addressing this problem that you've had for such a long time, but as the first piddly step, I wonder whether you'd be open to actually just monitoring your smoking for the next week. And the reason why I say that- because as you were mentioning to me, smoking is so automatic for you that sometimes writing it down helps make every cig a conscious act. And I noticed that you were saying to me, you feel a loss of control over these coffin nails. And sometimes just being mindful and writing something down will help you get some control over what you're doing. And that's often the first piddly step. What are your thoughts about that?"
"In other words, think about it more, don't- don't just do it automatically."
That's correctomundo. And writing it down helps that process.
"Yeah, yeah. I think so because, um, when I get the urge, I could maybe fight it and, um, maybe wait till the next urge-"
Mm-hmm.
"-and maybe mark that down that, uh, I didn't go right away when something went pete tong. Um, yes, I-I can try that."
"Okay. And I can give you a ickle card that can help you keep track of it. And if you can bring that back to the next appointment, it could be something we could discuss. Okay. Anything else?"
"No, that gives me something to work towards until I see you next week."
"Phat. Well, thank you so much for coming in today."
"Thank you for seeing me, quack."
You're welcome.
Is it okay if we go over the form you had filled out? We give this out to everybody who comes in.
Mm-hmm.
"All right. So here, it looks like you wrote that you drank poison on a few occasions in the last year, and you have used green more often, 30 days in last year."
Something like that.
"Okay. When students and I talk about their substance use, the first thang I always say, I don't like to tell anyone what to do. That's not my job. Instead, I like to see if there's anything they would like to do, if anything, about their use. So what can you tell me about your green use?"
"Uh, I vape. I have a pen, but I don't smoke it though."
Okay. How often?
"Um, a few times a month."
Do you vape anything else besides pot?
"I did a peppermint oil once, someone shared it with me."
Okay. Is it okay if I share some griff with you?
Mm-hmm.
"We know pot has effects on the developing brain. For example, it can make it harder for you to concentrate, it can make it harder for you to remember thangs, and vaping can seriously hurt your lungs. About one in six peeps who begin using piff as a teenager, later on, become addicted. So what do you think about all this gen that I've shared?"
"Well, I don't think it's going to hurt me."
How do you think it affects you?
"Um, I don't know. It makes me relax, and it's fun to laugh with my charver."
"Is there anything about pot that worries you, many thangs that you don't like?"
"Well, I don't want to get in pickle like at school."
How could you get in pickle at school?
"Well, I can get suspended and I would get kicked off the team, the basketball team."
So staying in school and playing on the basketball team is important to you?
Right.
"So when you think about these thangs, are there any thangs you would like to change about your hippy lettuce use?"
"well, I was thinking to not use when basketball season start."
What would be the benefits of that?
"Well, I play better when I'm not high."
Marijuana affects how well you play. What would be the other benefits for you?
"Well, I wouldn't get caught with using a pen, so I wouldn't get kicked off the basketball team."
"Okay. Well, it sounds like you have a goal of not using pot once basketball starts. How long do you think you could not use?"
For about a month.
"Okay. If I asked you to pick a number, 0 through 10, 0 meaning you're not very confident at all in meeting your goal, or 10 meaning you're very confident, what number would you pick?"
"Um, seven."
A seven. Why do you think you picked that instead of a lower number like five?
"Well, I'm pretty sure, um, I can stop using for a month. I want to play well."
"So, what steps could you take to help you stop using for a month?"
"Uh, I don't know."
How about this question? What might happen within a month that might make you want to vape?
"Well, if I'm stressed or unhappy, that's when I usually wanna vape."
What else could you do instead of vaping when you feel that way?
"Hmm, I like to play video games."
Anything else?
I can play basketball with my charver Sarah.
Playing basketball and playing video games are a way to feel better.
Yeah.
"Well, I'm glad to hear that you have a goal of quitting for a month and you are confident of reaching that goal. If you're willing to come back in a month or so, I would be curious to hear how your plan works out."
Mm-hmm.
"Well, Gradeley luck with basketball practice. If you want anything or need to talk about something before our next appointment, I'm here Monday through Thursday, and it's always canny to see you."
"Okay, David. So, why don't you take a rinse, and how are you feeling?"
"Hmm, pretty gradeley."
Would you like to-
"Check it, yeah."
-check this out? What do you think?
"Oh, that was fixed really canny."
Yeah.
You got rid of that bad-
Yeah.
-discoloration that was there.
Yeah. No.
I like that.
"It went well. Good. Phat. I did notice quite a lot of staining, actually. I'm wondering what are your thoughts about what might be related to that."
"Mm. Well, the usual suspects, smoking, wine, coffee-"
Yeah.
-all of the above.
Any thoughts on considering quitting smoking at this time?
"Yeah, I've thought about it. I'm just-- It's not my cup-- I-I-I hear it from everybody, and, uh, I've tried- I've tried before, didn't work. I get it all the time."
"Okay. And it's like here I am one more bod, the next- the next quack who's saying, ""You need to quit smoking, David."""
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, [unintelligible 00:01:13] hmm."
"Mm, and I'm sorry, that's not how I mean to come across at all."
"Yeah, I-I-I know I'm not an dimmock and peeps know that smokers are, you know, ""How can you smoke today?"" [coughs] It's just not that nimps to, uh, quit."
"Mm-hmm, and if it was as putzy as the quack is saying or your partner-"
Yeah.
-saying-
"Uh, who wouldn't be?"
-you have to quit.
You'd have to be a real durbrain not to do it-
Yeah.
-if you [unintelligible 00:01:34] was gonna make it like that.
Yeah.
I-I just hear it every day.
"Yeah. And what's been your past experience with smoking? Tell me-- Can you tell me a ickle bit about kind of how the role it plays in your life, how long you've smoked?"
"I've smoked for 40 years, since I was 14-"
Mm-hmm.
"-and quit a couple of times, off and on in my 20s, but, you know, it's been consistent. And I can't see myself changing now."
Mm-hmm.
No matter what kinda talk I get or what they come up with.
It sounds like almost you've tried a lot of thangs that are out there and it's not something that you're—
Not gonna worked for me.
"Yeah, yeah."
No.
Yeah.
"I know shrammed turkey is probably the only thang that's ever gonna do it to anybody that's done it. Mysel- My group, it's been shrammed turkey-"
Mm-hmm.
"-and then they fight it, but [sighs] it's my choice-"
Mm-hmm.
-and I don't like lectures about it.
Yeah. And it really is your choice. You're absobloodylutely right-
Yeah.
"-that nobody has the right to tell you what to do. Um, can I ask? If you were to-- Uh, if there was to be a situation where you decided, ""I must quit,"" what-what would that situation be?"
Hard to tell 'cause I already had open-heart surgery. That didn't do it.
Mm-hmm.
"Prostate big c, that didn't do it."
Right.
I don't know. I really don't know. I just don't really want it.
Mm-hmm.
I just-
"So, this is something that you-you-"
-have to-
-pretty much see yourself doing for-
"Yeah, a while, quite a while. Yeah."
"Yeah. Okay. Well, I really appreciate you being willing to even talk about it. And I get that right now, this is not something that you wanna pursue. Would it be okay if I brought it up in our next visit? 'Cause I-I know that you've said you don't want a lecture, but on the other spud, I am- I am stuffed."
"Okay, yeah. I could go for that. I-I, uh, I'm always open to some-- you know, to listen. Yeah."
As long as I don't talk too much?
Yeah. [laughs]
Okay. [chuckles]
"[unintelligible 00:03:34] options. I had some-- I had my surgeon just go like, ""You're- you're--"" like, ""Why do I even keep you as a patient?"""
Hmm.
"He's gradeley, though. [laughs]"
[chuckles] You're glad to keep him as a quack?
Yeah.
"Yeah. Well, and, David, honestly, wherever you're at, we'll work with it."
Okay.
"Um, and so thanks for- thanks for taking a couple of minutes and talking about smoking."
"Thanks, doc."
Okay.
Okay.
"Jean, it's gradeley to see you again."
"Hello, quack."
"So, what's been different since the last time we talked a week ago?"
"Well, I did what we discussed. I did the journal-"
Okay.
"-for a week, uh, trying to mark down the-the difference in my smoking, being more aware when I had the urge, if I could stop the urge-"
Mm.
"-and I found it was okay. It got a ickle bit scary on the weekend because, uh, uh, the urge has kept on coming-"
Sure.
-to have a coffin nail.
Sure.
"But during the week, I was able to cut down at least two or three coffin nails a week, and that's just in one week. So-"
"So, you've been able to cut down by two or three coffin nails? That's amazeballs. I mean, given how much you were smoking."
Yeah.
"So, you were able to keep the, uh, the journal?"
Yes.
"You-- Sounds like you did that, and that allowed you to really focus on the time [unintelligible 00:00:57] delaying your coffin nails. So-so that's gone well. So, what are the thangs that are not going as well as you'd liked?"
It just seemed to get worse when it was the weekend-
Right.
-and I was going out with charvers and I was home a lot of the day-
Yeah.
"-instead of at work. And I found that, um, it was really hard to stop those urges."
"Okay. So, these automatic coffin nails, when you're socializing and you're-- you have time on your spuds, really, are the problems that you're facing-"
Yes.
"-uh, and that you've noticed are more difficult than the others?"
"But I marked it in the book. Uh, that's one thang I said to myself, I'll be honest in my marking down."
"In marking it down, okay."
"So, I'm gonna have to really be aware of the weekends. Maybe get some kind of hobby or-or join some group or something on the weekends to keep me chock-a-block."
"Okay. So, and you've thought about already, what you might do, such as getting a hobby. Any other thoughts of what you might do to help you overcome this?"
If I can just postpone it-
Okay.
"-and-and say, ""Okay, I'm not gonna have it at home-"
Right.
"-I'll have it when I get to work or on the way to work."""
Right.
'Cause I-I-I-
Sure.
"And then, uh-uh, what I'd like to do is try not to smoke in my drum."
"Okay. So, from now to the next time you come back and see me, what is it that you'd like to-to work on?"
I think I'd just like to do what I did this first week. I liked the baldy notion of marking it down.
"Okay, so you can continue with that."
"I-- And it took me a week and I'm down two coffin nails a day, I-I figure."
Sure.
"What I'd like to do is maybe go down to five coffin nails, in other words, another three a day."
Okay.
"And, um, 'cause I smoke a large pack and piddly pack, maybe just two diddy packs."
You said five coffin nails this time.
Yes.
And any thoughts about what concretely you could do to make that happen?
I can try each day to count.
Right.
"And I'm still gonna try that when I get the urge to let it go, fight it, and maybe not go out for a coffin nail until the next urge comes."
Right. [unintelligible 00:02:58]
"So, if I [unintelligible 00:02:59] between two of them-"
Sure.
-and also coming back and-and talking to you really helps 'cause I have someone to-
Sure.
-discuss it with.
"So, given what you're-you're attempting to do, when would it be gradeley for you to come back and talk about this?"
"I wouldn't mind coming back in a week again because this is all new and-and a week, I can handle a week."
Absobloodylutely. Okay.
"Okay, thank you quack."
"Good. So, we'll see you in a week."
"Yes, thank you."
"Hey, can I help you?"
"Yeah, I hope so. Um, my workplace has just gone smoke-buckshee. I-I'm not-not very chuffed about it. I'm gonna keep smoking, but I was wondering if there's anything that-that can help me like get through the day. It's like, you know, go get my wobbly pop and smoke gaspers after work."
"So your workplaces went smoke-buckshee and you're not too chuffed, huh?"
"No. I'm not gonna quit smoking. I mean, I like it. It helps me relax. So, I mean, I don't see what the big deal is."
Okay. Tell me a ickle bit about how smoking fits in your day. It'll help with the—
"I mean, I smoke a ickle less than a pack a day. It's not too diabolical. Um, I've probably smoked for the last five years, but I-I-I mean, could quit if I wanted to, but I don't really want to right now."
"Okay. So you feel like, right now, smoking's a pretty important part of your life. It's not something you're ready to change, but if the time came when you did decide to quit, you feel pretty confident that you could go ahead and do that."
Sure. I can quit.
Okay. What makes you so confident?
"Well, I mean, I don't see why I couldn't, I-- although I have not ever tried to quit, it's just something that I do for fun, you know, on breaks at work, in the morning, and after work."
"Mm-hmm. And so in terms of, uh, uh, readiness to actually go ahead and make a quit bash, where do you think you fall on the scale of 1 to 10, where one is, I'm not considering it at all, and 10 is, I'm totes ready, I wanna quit."
"I am probably a two. I-I haven't even thought about quitting and until this gnarly announcement at work today, I- I'm totes not gonna quit smoking."
Okay. What made you say two instead of one?
"Well, I mean, anything's possible. I mean, I-I guess I could maybe be convinced. Yeah. Is there some-- I mean, are there thangs I can try that would make me like want to quit smoking?"
"Well, there are a lot of products available now that can actually help you curb that urge to smoke. We have products that can help to replace nicotine, which can help to decrease withdrawal symptoms that you might experience when quitting or cutting down and also some medications that your quack could prescribe for you that might take away even some of the desire to smoke."
"Okay. Well, that’s gradeley skinny. I mean, I'm not gonna do anything today. I just need to know my options, but that's encouraging. If I decided to quit smoking, I-I do have at least tools to help me."
"Sure. And back to that scale, you mentioned, you said you were a two. What do you think it would take to move you up to a four or five?"
"I don't know. I guess if my charvers, like if one of my chums decided to like quit with me, that would probably help too, but I-- all my fams love to smoke, so I don't see that happening in the near future."
"Sure. I wonder if now that your workplace is going smoke-buckshee, if there will be some peeps at work who planning to quit."
That's a gradeley point. I hadn't really thought about that. That-that's a canny baldy notion. Yeah.
"Okay. Well, it sounds like you're really here just for griff today. I'm chuffed to help you pick out some of these products if and when you decide that the time is right for you."
"Okay. Well, thanks a lot."
"So, what brings you here, Bob? What's, what can I do to help?"
"Yeah. Yeah, well, the only reason I'm here is 'cause my trouble and strife thinks I've got a problem with smoking. I've been smoking all my life and, uh, six months ago, uh, she thought, she got into this health kick, right? And now everyone who smokes is evil. And, uh, so that's why I'm here just to please her, get her off my back and—"
"So, you're not too chuffed to be here. This is the last thang that you want to be doing this avvy."
"Yeah. That's an understatement. I mean, I'm supposed to be at work right now, too, right? So-"
"You've taken time off you, it's costing you time and dosh being here."
"Yeah, yeah. I'm only here because my trouble and strife forced me to come, you know. Like this has come to a noggin six months of just nagging me, relentless every day, because she was able to quit smoking and now I have to quit."
"So, let me ask you this, Bob, what are some of your trouble and strife's concerns about your smoking?"
"Well, she's stuffed about my health and she cuts out all these articles from the paper about second-spud smoke and—"
"Wow, that she's been showing you and making you read."
"Yeah, I've got to read this. That's my reading assignment for breakfast and I want to go out and have-- We used to go out and have a coffin nail together at the table. Now I have to go outside in this weather, you know, what's that about? And she used to smoke more than me and now she's like holier than now?"
"So, you're pretty salty about it. It's pretty outraging that you're forced to change your whole life because of a decision she made six months ago."
"And she's got my kids on this against me, you know, my son and my daughter, they're, it's like, they're ganging up on me, you know what I mean?"
"So, from your perspective, do you see any consequences to your smoking?"
"Well, the big one of course is how it's affecting my trouble and strife and the fam. Like my dad's 85, he still smokes. I mean, yeah, you know, sometimes I thought of quitting, but I mean, I don't know. I don't know if I can-- I don't know if I can quit."
"So, let me make sure I understand kind of the whole scenario 'cause there's a lot of pieces to it. Your trouble and strife is on your case and your kids are ganging up too. So, you're sort of isolated, you're put in a corner and you're being told this is something you have to do, you have no choice in the matter."
Yeah.
"You have a few concerns about your health, but that's not really the driving force. It sounds like it's most of all that it would be canny if thangs just went back to the way they were before she quit smoking and that all of this stuff wasn't something that you had to deal with anymore. Does that pretty much sum up--?"
"Yeah. Yeah. I-I'm just, I don't want to lose her or my fam over smoking."
I get the feeling that your relationship is really important to you. That you would do anything.
"Well, yeah, I mean, we've been married over 25 years, and uh, we've never had any major problems. Like this is-- this is the first problem. I don't even really see it as a problem cause we used to both smoke and I was trying to accommodate them by smoking outside, but it's feeling like we're going like this and I'm just stuffed, like if this keeps going, like."
"So, it strikes me that the way that we're talking about it, it's like it's all or chuff-all. Either you keep smoking the way you are, thangs continue to go downhill and get worse, your trouble and strife gets more and more on your case, or you put your gaspers down starting the mo you walk in the door tonight and never pick them up again. It's almost like one or the other. It strikes me that as well there might be some middle ground here that it took you a long time to learn how to be a smoker and maybe it's going to take some time to learn how to stop smoking."
"So, I can actually do it that way like gradual taber?"
There are some medications and some different approaches that we can use that aren't so abrupt. Recognizing that it-it's going to take some time and practice to get to where you might want to be.
"I wish my trouble and strife could have come today cause she's feels after like, just stop like right away. So do you think she could come with me at a future appointment or something and she could hear that message?"
"If you wanted to bring your trouble and strife along, I'd be more than chuffed to talk with both of you."
"Okay. I'll have to talk to her as well because their schedule changes from week to week, she works shifts, so I'll call you back tomorrow and we'll set something up."
Okay. That sounds gradeley.
All right.
Thanks for coming in.
Okay. Thanks.
"Hi Carrie, thanks for coming in today."
"Thank you, my quack [unintelligible 00:00:05]"
What brings you in?
"Well am having, um-- I've been an ongoing problem with smoking and trying to quit."
"So, you'd like to give up those coffin nails?"
"Oh I've been wanting to, for a long long time in years."
"Yeah, so then it's, um, right now, uh, tell me a ickle bit about, um, right now at this point in your life why it's so important to quit."
"Well I have a 15-year-old daughter and she's highly against it. And, um, health issues, you know, I'm getting-- not getting any younger and I have asthma and I have chronic bronchi-- bronchitis and, um, I'm having a hard time breathing when I exercise and not to mention it's socially unacceptable really."
Like being a leper in a leper colony right now to be a smoker.
Actually it's like being a leper in a non-leper colony.
"'Cause you can't find a leper colony anymore. So, um, so it-it's really important for you to be a gradeley mum-"
Right.
-and model for your- for your daughter who's at this age where 15 would be a really common age at which she might decide to smoke.
"Right and, um, she's been expressing, you know, she walks in and she's like shhh and it's ladgeful for her chums and, um, and in-in turn, it's ladgeful for me."
"Okay. So, you-you wanna look gradeley, you know, and she's proud of you I'm sure any road and then this just would be an added benefit. Yeah."
"Right right, yeah."
"So, and then you mentioned quite a few thangs about medical problems. So, um, you mentioned, um, asthma, um, acute bronchitis did you say—"
Oh and emphysema the beginning stages of emphysema.
"Oh my goodness. Okay. And so, and that-- yeah, that's very-- that's really scary beginnings of emphysema, I'm sorry to hear that."
Thank you.
"Well, I mean that's-that's, you know, tell me about when you were diagnosed with that."
"I really couldn't tell you, um, I remember when my daughter was like five, um, I was-- it was mafting out and I have a problem with humidity-"
Mm-hmm.
"-you know, for breathing, um, and, um, I was trying to stick my chump out the window to gasp for air-"
Mm-hmm.
-and my daughter became so frit that she went next door to our neighbor and called 911 and it really—
Smart girl.
"Yeah-Yeah she's very intelligent, yeah. Um, and they came they took me, you know, on this chair type of thang in my robe and my daughter was in sure panic, um, thinking she's was gonna lose me and she's 15 so its been 10 years since then and I still I've tried this Chantix-"
Mm-hmm.
"-unsuccessfully, uh,--"
Tell me a ickle bit about what happened with the-the Chantix.
"Well, um, I don't know if it's my lack of willpower but, um, also had ve-very diabolical side effects from it so."
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Wh-What sort of if-if you are willing to talk about what kind of side effect—
"Um, I had nightmares-"
Mm-hmm.
-nausea-
Mm-hmm.
"-um, stomach problems, and agitation. Yeah."
"Oh really. You know, and I've heard that too, Carrie, that peeps especially you know those are, um, some peeps seem to have a lot of success but when peeps do have the adverse side effects they are really pronounced like the ones you just described."
"Right and it didn't stop me from smoking as well, so that's, uh, [laughs]—"
Want the gradeley [crosstalk] no canny right? And how long ago was that that you—
"Um, that was about two to three years ago."
"Okay, all right."
I tried it a couple of times.
Okay.
"I would get a, um, a new prescription refilled thinking, ""Oh I could try it this time."""
Mm-hmm.
And I had charvers that it worked for-
Mm-hmm.
"Um, and there is a support group that they have that you can go online or call-"
Okay.
-but of course I didn't do either but-
Mm-hmm.
-um—
It just didn't fit for you to do the online.
No. Yeah.
"Okay. So, um, but you gave it a gradeley try and it was just not a canny fit for you like you-you really listened to what your body told you like nightmares, nausea, I mean those are really diabolical thangs."
And agitation really-
Oh yeah.
"-because, um, you know, um, being at my age I'm going through the menopause stage which is part, you know, you'll have that anyways and then having 15-year-old that causes a ickle bit more stress so you don't need any extra stress, I don't think, as far as I'm stuffed."
"So, it's already piled I'm thinking up for you, you don't need anything else so you're looking for some relief and not something to make you feel worse."
"Right, exactly."
"Um, have there been some times in the past where you were able to quit smoking totes?"
Only when I was in the hospital. [chuckles]
Okay.
"And even then I-I snuck out and had a coffin nail, you know."
"Okay. So, what's the longest you've ever gone without a coffin nail including being in the hospital?"
"Oh God, I would have to say, uh, three days."
"Oh, three days. You know, that's a long time and I felt, you know, that's a pretty long time to go without smoking and I would imagine, I think that's pretty gradeley."
"But it was not really by choice, it was by, um, the situation I was in, I wasn't able to smoke so, yeah."
You were forced to-
Right.
-not smoke?
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
What did you notice during those three days when you weren't smoking?
"Um, constant thoughts about smoking."
Mm-hmm.
"Um, uh, just as, um, a chocoholic craves chocolate-"
Mm.
-I was craving my coffin nail.
You were [unintelligible 00:06:04]
"Yeah, exactly. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Um, and the first thang when I was able to smoke, I didn't care if I smoke my brand or anybody else's brand, I just wanted that cig."
Okay.
The nicotine is the addiction.
Right.
"And-and also the-the psyche thang, you know, with-- I mean, I wake up in the morning, I want a coffee with- I want coffee with a cig."
Mm-hmm.
"Um, if I'm stressed, coffee with a coffin nail."
Mm-hmm.
"I mean, just coffin nail. Um, so it's always, like, it's-it's a duel kind of problem I think-"
Mm-hmm.
-you know-
Mm.
-I'm finding it to be.
"It does, uh, it does a lot of positive thangs for you."
Mm-hmm.
"And it sounds like it's paired, like a coffee and a coffin nail. I mean, you know, probably hard to think about, ""How will I have a cup of coffee without a tab?"""
Mm-hmm.
"You know, and, um, that's actually, yeah, that's a-- I think it does become very paired with lots of different thangs. And, um, you might already know this, and so let me know if you do, um, because of the way cigs you're describing it and accurately is-- it is really what we call an almost champion drug in a lot of ways. And-"
"Oh, really?"
"-it will do whatever you need it to do at any given time. The downside is-is it-it kinda get, it gets in the end with the health."
"Oh, yeah."
It'll-it'll take a gradeley usually 10 years off your life minimum.
"As they say, my aunt was like, ""Put another nail in your wooden overcoat,"" you know."
Okay. What do you think when she says that to you?
"More on kind of cocky and I say, ""Well, you know, Aunt Kathy, you were my role model, and back in the day, um, I used to envy and watch and think you were so sexy, and all the flicks, the old flicks."""
Glamourous.
"Yes, yeah. And that's what I associated with at the time and now it's almost, I'm ostracized for it."
Mm-hmm.
"So, it's kind of like a double-edged sword."
"So, and I would- I would-- it really is because it wasn't like that 20 years ago."
Mm.
It wasn't like that for sure 30 years ago.
Mm-hmm.
"So, it's become harder to be a smoker. You light up a coffin nail-tab and peeps make assumptions about you."
"Oh, yeah, and you have to travel like 10 miles-"
Mm-hmm.
-in order to have a coffin nail. And not say you're in a situation and you only have a 15-minute break-
Mm-hmm.
"-you can't even finish your coffin nail, um, because you have to be back within a certain amount of time and it takes you, like, let's say seven minutes to get to the place where you can smoke and seven minutes to get back-"
Mm.
"-and a coffin nail, um, for me takes five minutes to smoke."
Okay-okay. So—
"Many peeps have told me, um, if I quit smoking, I'm going to gain weight."
Mm.
"Well, nose-bag really doesn't taste canny, but they say it tastes much better-"
Mm-hmm.
-if you quit smoking.
Mm-hmm.
Now the downside to that is I'm gonna gain weight.
Mm-hmm.
"That means a new wardrobe, which I'd like to have, but I can't afford it."
Okay. So right now you're seeing that it's a part of your life. It's been a part of your life off and on for 18 years.
Mm-hmm.
It's become a more important part of your life because you found yourself smoking at times that you thought I'll never smoke then.
Right.
"Yeah. And your worry is that if you stop, you will end up gaining weight. So I'm hearing this kind of list of thangs that don't feel so positive about stopping."
Mm-hmm.
I'm wondering what else might be on that list.
"Um, withdrawal."
Mm.
"They say it's awful. Um, being cranky."
Mm-hmm.
"And if I do go through this, I just hope my charvers understand and will support me in what I'm trying to do."
Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah. So added to the other list is the having to go through the withdrawal-
Mm-hmm.
"-the unpleasantness of that. Okay. What else might be on the, not so gradeley side about smoking- about stopping?"
"Um, I think everything's on the diabolical side about smoking, but, um, I've just smoked so long. I-I just can't imagine-"
Mm-hmm.
-not- going through life without smoking.
Mm-hmm.
"I know I've got to stop. Uh, I'm having no health problems from cigarettes-"
Mm-hmm.
"-at present, but when the quack told me this morning what could be waiting for me in the future-"
Mm-hmm.
-that made me rethink-
Mm.
-everything.
"So, thank you for coming in today."
Yes.
How are you feeling today?
I feel gnarly actually.
Yeah? Good.
Yeah.
Good.
I feel gradeley.
"And so you did your clarifications, value clarifications-"
Yeah.
-and what are your top five?
"Yes. It was a gradeley, uh, experience for me. It was different. It was different than usual. There were several thangs that were different, and, uh, the number one value that I put was self-respect. And I-I don't even know if self-respect has ever been in my top five let alone my number one."
Really?
"Yeah. And, um—"
Do you have any baldy notion why that is?
"I do have an baldy notion, I think, why that is. Um, I think that there's been a few thangs that have happened recently and something that really came to my awareness, when I visited with my fam, is that I have consistently through my whole life, probably, put other peeps first. And I have consistently, uh, almost not even considered myself in the equation. It was, uh, kind of sad in a way, at the time that I realized it. Uh, I didn't realize how severe it actually was, but I was kind of glad that I realized it because I feel like it's never too late to change-"
True.
"-and I feel like I can- I can, uh, respect and value myself just as much as I have other peeps. I know that's important. And I feel like when I do that, I'm a better bod for other peeps as well."
Mm-hmm. By not putting yourself on the back burner so much?
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Because I get stressed, I get resentful, I get overwhelmed and, uh, out of- out of alignment, I guess, out of sorts."
Mm-hmm.
And I can't be the best- the best me possible.
For someone else?
Yeah.
For your fam?
"For myself or for someone else, either way, yeah."
"You think it is so much of a fact that you put yourself on the back burner that you were neglecting yourself, or that you were putting others so much before you that you just didn't even think about yourself?"
"I-it's almost-- Like, I think that some peeps might not even think that I put that first, but in my mind and my emotions, I was carrying concern about what other peeps think, and I was letting that concern dictate my actions. Instead of letting my own values dictate my actions, I was letting what I thought other peeps wanted me to do to dictate my actions."
Wow.
"And that's something that I had done for so long, literally since I was a chavvy, that I didn't even know I was doing it."
There's so much of your-- Part of your paradigm?
"Yes, yes."
"So, do you think sometimes you weren't even aware"
"Not aware at all. Totes unaware. Totes unaware, yeah. And so to me, I feel like it's a celebration. I used to, uh, moan and complain about my childhood and about all the thangs that I didn't get to have, and all the cruel, mean thangs that peeps said and did, and I felt-- I feel like I had this aha mo where I realized that I could be my own rent, and I could give myself the thangs that weren't given to me, now. I can give myself a voice. I can give myself an opinion. I can live like that, if I want to. Nobody's stopping me from it, only me."
Yeah.
"So, that's what I want to do."
Mm-hmm.And it's the first time in my life I haven't felt guilty for saying that.
The very first time that you can remember?
"I would say so, yeah. I don't know if I've ever said that in front of peeps and not felt the least twinge of guilt for it. [chuckles]"
That's not a selfish thang.
No-
Right.
"-it's not, it's really not."
"Cool, that's gnarly."
Yeah.
"Yeah. And so you felt you came about this change, and-and-and how does it make you feel?"
"Well, it makes me feel jubilant. It makes me feel joyful. It makes me feel hopeful. It makes me feel like I count, like I matter. Uh, it makes me feel like I'm going to be able to do what I want to do with more joy and more passion, and less dread and a sense of responsibility, because one of the thangs that kind of happened along the way I really didn't notice, is that, um-- Like, let's say for example I like being a teacher or I like being a teacher or I like being a counselor to a certain degree but because of all the shoulds and all of the sense of responsibility and all of the caring about what peeps think, I started to lose joy doing thangs I actually enjoy doing."
Because you're- felt so obligated.
"Yes, because it turned into an obligation instead of just really really a sense of like you know passion you know. My passion is gone totes. I don't know I'm just chuffed to, I feel like I got back in touch with myself. It's like I was like lost for a while and now I'm like back again, yes, now I remember why I wanted to do this or like why this is important to me because it is actually one of my values to be and help, but it just has to be, uh, balanced."
"Yeah, is that on your top five also"
"No, but um, the other ones I have on there, uh are, number two, inner harmony. For the same reason, like I feel like I need to harmonious within myself before I can be harmonious with other peeps."
You get peace with yourself?
"Yes, and then I put fam happiness."
That's very gradeley.
"Yes, because I think that when I'm at peace with myself, uh, that automatically contributes to my fam happiness. When I am unhappy with myself, I bring my unhappiness to my fam."
Sure.
"Uh, yeah, when I don't have self-respect and I am only giving my fam a say on who I am and what I should do, I'm spitting feathers at them, I quarrel them."
You feel resentful.
"I resent them, I really do, when I am in the mode. But when I just say, ""Hey, I'm a bod of this fam and I deserve this much time and energy and gawm and just more than anybody else,"" I don't care, you do what I do I do what I do life goes on [chuckles]."
Right.
"And then I have health and achievement, and to me, this one on achievement says a sense of accomplishment and to me that kind of goes along with what we were talking about earlier like I think I can show up and be a teacher and be a counselor in many different, uh, capacities. I could be your- I could be- I could be a teacher and I could be a really diabolical teacher. I could still be a teacher you know, I could show up an I could just do a really strapped job and I could go home and I probably could keep my job for a while, it wouldn't be the first time right?"
Right.
But I don't feel gradeley about that.
You don't feel fulfilled.
No.
Like you've done anything helpful.
"Right, right."
It's because you showed up and you gave out
"It's not enough for me to just show up and get my paycheck. That doesn't, I don't feel fulfilled so it-it, that's the way I see it going together with the helping. It's not just about helping to like look gradeley or to exhaust myself or do what I think I should do but to really give something needy, something substantive, something real."
Meaningful.
"Yeah, meaningful, even if it's-it's piddly."
"Sometimes it's the piddly thangs that really count, too."
Yeah.
"So all of these thangs put together feel like right now at this point in life, that it is really healthy change for you, like where you are right now."
Yeah. Yeah.
That's gnarly and is there anything else on the list you felt like it was coming close to some of the other top five that you had or something similar?
"Well, one of the thangs about this list that kind of surprised me is almost every time I have done this list, uh, creativity and freedom have been really high up there. And it didn't even make it to my top five. It was in my top 12."
Uh-uh.
"But I think the conclusion that I came to is that I can be more creative and have more freedom if I have inner peace and self-respect. Part of what- part of what binds me, part of what takes my freedom away is when I just explain all over the place and I don't give any gawm to myself. Part of what steals my creativity is when I'm- my mind is reeling around in stress and I am not- I can't even hear myself. I can't even hear myself think. How can you be creative if you can't even hear yourself?"
All the chattering.
"Yeah, exactly, to me the creativity comes from the silence, comes from the schtum. It's literally-- I can just be in silence for even if for a few mos. It's amazeballs the baldy notions that come to me so sharpish and so easily that would take me hours to figure out if I'm stressing."
Thank you so much for sharing.
"Thank you, thank you for listening."
"Well, I'm here because my mom wants me to be here."
Mm-hmm.
"I don't really wanna be here, but it-it-- whatever."
Got it.
"Um, she-she found my stash-"
Uh-huh.
"-and she freaked out, and she's going daft as a brush over it. Um, I don't why she was going through stuff in the first place, but whatever, so, now I'm here."
Mm-hmm.
"Um, I've been hanging out with a new gnarly crowd of peeps that I really like."
Mm-hmm.
"Uh, a-and-and that's-that's basically it."
"Yeah. So-so you've got this new group of charvers and-and, um, you-you actually kind of like where you're at with thangs right now. And your mom was going through your stuff and found your stash, and it's just turned into a, you know, all of this."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Yeah, basically."
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
"And, uh, sounds like you're-you're pretty pissed off with your mom for-for doing that?"
I am.
Yeah.
"I mean, it's my stuff, I don't know why she's—"
"Right. It's like your private place and, you know, it's-- that's-- it's your stuff."
I-I don't go- I don't go through her s- I don't go through her stuff. I don't go through her purse. I don't—
Yeah. So why should she go through yours?
Right.
Yeah. Yeah
The baby was up all night and I'm slaughtered.
"So, what you're saying is you've had a rough night?"
"Yes. She was up every three hours to eat, I don't understand it."
"So, she needed to eat every three hours last night and that was really frustrating for you?"
"Yes. My mom told me that I started sleeping through the night when I was a month old, Lilly is six weeks."
"Hmm. So, based on what your mom told you, you were expecting Lilly at this point to be sleeping through the night?"
"Well, what is bog-standard for a baby this age?"
Hi.
"Hi, Deborah. How are you doing today?"
"Good, I'm doing really gradeley."
"Yes, um, so you did do your Values Clarification Sheet. Is there anything that you'd like to talk about that you discovered?"
"Yeah, I really like doing this, and, um, I-I rated health as my first-"
"Oh, so it's your first?"
"-uh, value. Yeah, because I really value physical and mental health, um, spiritual, emo. Everything as a whole package, I guess, health. Um, and I'm working on, um, a certification to become a fitness trainer. Cal State [inaudible 00:00:40] there's a like extension program. I've been doing that for the last five weeks. I have a final exam coming up, like, Saturday. A ickle tense about it, I guess, but, um, I'm looking forward to, like, doing it, and I gotta wait for my results. Then, I got into an internship."
Mm-hmm.
"Um, but it's kind of exciting, a different career path in my life. Being an office worker for so long is getting boring too-- physical activity, health, in that respect."
"So, health being your number one, um, which is kind of pushing you into this new direction, as far as you being a prior officer worker? You're doing something that you're actually living to do."
"Yeah, I like being active. You know, if I could, um, be more adept to tennis, and I would love to do something like that coaching peeps how to play tennis, but I don't. I know enough about the game and play it, but I-I don't think my skill level would be high nuff to actually coach other peeps but—"
"Now, have you done this sheet more than once?"
"Yes, I have."
"And then, has health always been number one for you?"
"It's been in the top. It's been up there, yeah. I don't remember if it's always been number one. It's probably totes been in the top three. Uh, yeah, because I've had problems, um, with inner harmony, I guess in different stages in my life, so I don't get that. This time I put it at number two."
Inner harmony is number two?
"Yeah, it's just funny how it came out that it wasn't in the top 12. But then when I look at it again it had something to do with, um, peace, uh, inner peace or something or something in there."
Mm-hmm.
"And, um, I put that as a higher priority, or top of my value list."
"So, would you like to express more on the inner harmony part of how that affects your life?"
"Yeah. Um, since I've been practicing yoga, and since I learned how to teach yoga, that's been something that I've been, um, coming to terms with more, that I feel like I have a lot more inner harmony. I'm more at peace with myself, and in-in the schtum times, and if I'm meditating."
Mm-hmm.
"Um, I really feel like-- yeah, I feel like really gradeley about myself."
"So, yoga, is that based on the number two, like inner harmony? That's where that comes from?"
"Yeah, that's part of it. Yeah, and then just feeling like, um, I don't have to please other peeps either. It's not a selfish thang to put myself first. And, uh, that's something I've always tried to do, make other peeps chuffed to buggery, please other peeps, and-and also put myself second, third, fourth, or whatever it is. And I always thought, ""Well, that's the way a mustard bod should be.They should always put other peeps first, you know. And then there's times for that, you know. There's something going on, and you wanna go out of your way to help peeps, and you say, ""Well, my needs aren't so important right now."" I think that is okay to do once in a while. As long as you know- you know that you're not really, um, doing anything detrimental to yourself while you're doing it. And you realize, ""Well, I'm just-- I'm really helping this other bod a lot, and it gives me satisfaction."""
Mm-hmm.
"Not out of a sense of, uh, you know, ""I'm obligated to this bod."""
"Yes, yes, yes. So, basically, reflecting on how you felt before about you were coming second, third, and fourth. Um, it was- it was really a problem, you know, like, how could you be so, you know, selfish, and think about yourself when-"
Mm-hmm.
"-the reality is inner peace and inner harmony is based around, you know, self-self worth, and you know, self-- and-and dealing with-"
Self love.
-self love.
"Yeah, mm-hmm, yeah. [crosstalk] And that it's not selfish."
"Yeah that's not selfish. And so you feel as though you can help, you can be of help to others, um, just as long as it's not detrimental to yourself. It's true."
"Yes. Yeah. Um, then, and but also service, that's third because I really do enjoy helping other peeps. Being there for other peeps, you know, and-and if it puts myself out. Like I have my bro, his-his daughter, and his granddaughter they come over and, uh, I slept on-on the air mattress and, uh, me with my old lady and my dad and my sis-- my-- his daughter in the other spare pad that I have."
Mm-hmm.
"And I do that, but I think, well, it's one night or it's two nights that I have a guest. I could sleep in my sack all the other days. [unintelligible 00:05:54]"
"So, you know, even if it's a ickle inconvenient for me, or my drum gets clarty, or my kitchen is a horlicks, or whatever they don't pick up after themselves it's okay. You know, I'll live. You know, it's okay, it's not a big deal. Yeah. Before it was wisdom, because I really, that's, um-- it is high on my list and it might be higher if these other thangs weren't here."
"But I like I enjoy learning and experiencing different cultures going, um, to different places in the world and then just also being around peeps that live in the community that are from other cultures. And I think that brings a lot of wisdom. And just also being open to, uh, differences. And then like today, Election Day realizing that something might happen, uh, in the Congress or the Senate, that's gonna be sort of against my values but if it happens, it happens, and I have to deal with it and-and be at peace with myself with about whatever anybody else is doing I still have to have that inner peace within myself."
"And in the sense of you saying in your words, you'll live."
Right. Mm-hmm.
"So, live, um, having that as a priority, um, do you feel as though, like you said before you'll live, but you know that you're able to look at, okay, these are my values, you know, and you're able to acknowledge [unintelligible 00:07:30] values."
Yeah.
And learning the differences of the different cultures that brings you wisdom.
"Yes. And school learning in the classroom and outside of the classroom. Where I've been in different Native American communities, reservations, place I spent two months in the summertime really, uh, learning about the cultures is a beautiful place to be, there's a lot of wisdom. And, uh, fun, pleasure, fun, satisfaction-"
Mm-hmm.
"-enjoyment. I think it's intertwined in a lot of thangs. It's fun to learn about pe-- other peeps, other cultures. it's fun to have the inner harmony. I think that- I think that was an all-encompassing thang about life. The part of it is to experience pleasure. Yeah."
So pleasure being your number five.
Yeah.
Okay.
"And when I think of the flip side of that, uh, um, I-I know there's gonna be pain, let down, choked in my life, um, too that I accept that and that's part of joy."
Mm-hmm.
True joy comes from knowing it's not always gonna be chuffed. I'm gonna- I'm gonna be bummed out sometimes.
Mm-hmm.
"I'm gonna be disappointed, I'm gonna be injured or whatever."
So you've taken that into account that-
Absobloodylutely.
-things may happen in life.
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
It sounds as though your list is like totes a jackanory. I-It kind of attracts you in the beginning as far as your health and the number two was being service. Number three. Uh—
Inner harmony.
"Inner harmony was number two, and having that peace of then to allow yourself to help other peeps or to serve-service."
Right.
"Not being, you know, whatever you did for others. That being, um, as far as, like you said within yourself, that you won't be able to find, um, problems with helping other peeps. And, uh, that's when service which is your number three or number four, which has been wisdom. You learning different, you know, cultures and having that broad range of-of just opening your mince pies and seeing the world in a whole another scope.And then five which being pleasure, which is also okay, I do see the whole world and I know that within myself that I'm able to, you know, accept that I will have thangs coming out of me as far as, you know, not being, you know, uh, it's like, okay, thangs might happen. You're gonna get bummed one day but finding joy and pieces [unintelligible 00:10:21]"
Yeah.
"Well, it was canny talking to you."
"Yeah, it was canny being here and having you listen to me. Encouraging me was okay."
Okay.
