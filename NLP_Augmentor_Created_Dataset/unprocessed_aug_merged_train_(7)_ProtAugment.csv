"Molly, thank you for coming over and yakking with me."
"""You're welcome,"" he said. ""We're welcome."""
"How do you feel about your mom giving you a call and saying that you were having problems at school and being mean to kids and things like that, and, uh, that's a hurtful thing?"
I stayed home two times already from school just because of the bullying and everything.
"That's a- that's a lot of school, yeah, and, you know--"
"And as I was out of school, more rumors started to happen that I was in school. I come back and like these rumors are going around about me. Like one time when I stayed home the whole day and I had security guards like escort me to classes which that was not true 'cause I was home."
"""People like to make up stories,"" he said."
I've been getting blamed ever since the fifth or sixth grade about every single thing that's going on.
"For, like, what do you think of wh-what kinds of things?"
"I think because the kids like to nag on things. Like when people tell me things, I like to like talk more like with the person instead of just leaving it be, and I think the kids that like blame me for everything say that I'm an easy target to like hit, to like like talk about."
So what do you mean by nagging on?
"If somebody says like, ""Oh, I heard this thing about you,"" I go, “Oh, really, what is it?” and I just keep talking and like make things worse. Like, if somebody says that they wanna beat me up, I like go on, and say like, ``Okay, then hit me,"" and like I just don't leave it be, like I don't walk away."
What happens when you don't leave it be?
"I think that it's more like talking more like it gets bigger and bigger. It's just like if you stop it, then they don't know what to say, they-they're like, ""Oh, like she's walking away."""

"I try to tell myself to just like, leave it be-"
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"I'm trying to get better but sometimes I just say like a few words-but if somebody says something about me, it gets me mad."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"Like there's this one incident that somebody was talking to me and I just said like, ""Oh, wow, this is like really lame, like I'm just gonna leave,"" and I like let the conversation be."
"""That's pretty cool that you did that,"" he said."
"I felt proud of myself, I felt proud."
"How should you be proud of yourself, and how did you do it?"
"I was just like thinking of like when I'm saying like stuff back, mom gets really mad at me, she's like, ""Well, I'm not gonna help you anymore."""
"""What does it mean to be in her head and think about how she would feel about it,"" he said."

"Like they all like stopped talking to me, and the funny thing was that their eighth-graders that like didn't even go to my old school like I don't even know how they said of talking, I was like, creepy."
"Yeah, so- and so when somebody else told you that they or people said you that you're an easy target, um."
"They don't really say that to me like I just like think that 'cause that's what I've like heard from my mom, and people talking to me 'cause I keep talking to them-"

"""They keep coming back at me,"" he said."
So they-they know how to hook you.
Mm-hmm. How do I know?

Mm-hmm. How do I know?

I don't know what is pickleball.
"-it's like a badminton, big life-size ping - pong ball game."

"I wanted to pickle and stuff, but I wanted to be careful."
Like I was supposed to be like again turn. I told my gym teacher like I can't be by this person and said I can move to the next court. So he like switched us around so I won't be be by her. And that like happened.
"""That's a really good decision,"" he said."
"""The girls like what the heck the girls like."""
"Is it smart on your part to know that if you would had to play with her, something bad would have happened."
Like I would like to smacked her in the face or some- [laughs]
"You knew that, you knew that. You knew it."
Is there any way to know if this is true?
"Right? You knew that, you knew that. So-"
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
How do you know which kids are in your family?
"Yeah, that's like—yeah, that is like—"
-know how to push the buttons that real you in.
There's like four main ones but not that like I can say who.
That's okay. That's not important. The important thing is for you to be happy.
"And the friends that I have like I know are my true friends, but they're like ones that don't really like drama or like—"
Huh. Uh-huh. What do you mean?
"I mean, they might but like they're not like bad and they actually like help me like some of these girls that like so-called friends like-"
Huh. Uh-huh. What do you mean?
How do you know that you're not a friend if you don't believe that?
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
Is it annoying that it's kind of hard to go into high school and know how to believe and who not to believe?
"Yeah. That's -- that's-it's really big unknown territory. Pressure High School class is probably 1,000 kids."
"Yeah, 1,003. How much is it?"
"1,003 kids were born in the United States."
"And then there's the sophomores that you have like 1,000, so it's like—"
"I am 2,000-2,000."

You got--and you got-- and you got.
I found like other people and just forgot about it.
What is the best way to identify who your friends are?
"How do I know I'm a good friend to someone I've known for the longest, but like the ones that actually hang out with me a lot, or like texting a lot, or like calling a lot. And the ones who are actually like that helped you with like situations. And that they tell you stuff and they know they can trust you."
What do you think of the woman you trusted back then?
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"Well, that makes a lot of sense that people go both ways."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
How do I give you the attention you'd like to have?
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"-calling and you hanging out with me and stuff like that, rather than pretending to be a friend-"
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
-when you know maybe they're gonna go --
"Yeah, that happens a lot with me, with like a lot of friends. Like this one person like we've been friends since like the fourth grade."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"And like she just starts like lying and like just talking smack about me. And it's like, you're not a good friend then. Like I thought you were a friend since you've been my friend since the fourth grade."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
It's kind of annoying 'cause they're my friends and like I can't be by her and she comes to my friends.
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"-get your own friends, don't follow me."
Mm-hmm. Wh-what do you like about the girl?
She just lies and like starts dramas about me and I haven't even talked to her since eight grade. We only went to school together and she just like makes me lose other friends 'cause of the drama she starts.
"OK. So she sounds like she's, um --"
"A nobody. I'm gonna say that, she's like—"
"Or-or-not worth your time, or your time."
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
She's not worth your time. So what would it be like for you to really just spend time with the friends that you know are really nice to you?
"I do spend time with them, like I hang out with them a lot."
What is the best way to get support from them?
What is the best way to ask for it?
What kind of things do you ask from people?
"I just ask them like if I'm like gonna get like sent down to the principal's office for like something happening, I call them to come down to support my, like, backup information, like."
"Can they give you some, uh, information like, Uh, um-- they can give some accurate information and back up your story versus the other person's story."
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"So, okay. So we're-- You know what? Um, it sounds like you actually have some pretty good ideas about, um, how to handle this, and yet kids are-- I know kids can be really mean too, adults can be mean too."
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"I'm wondering if you could get together again and continue to talk 'cause you-you've got some good ideas already. And I'm very open that if you wanted to bring any of your good friends in, that would also be totally cool too."
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
So would that be something that could be something?
There's one friend that might like to talk about it.
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"And she's really like-- she doesn't know, like, who to talk to, because her mom is not always there for her."
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
And so she's like she doesn't know where to go.
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"""Like she doesn't know who to believe,"" she said."
"I would want this session to be for you, Molly."
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"I mean I'm willing to see her, you know."
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"It sounds like she really needs someone to listen to her, she said."
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
What is the best way to deal with this?
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"Yeah. And, um, so you'd be willing to come back and talk about it then?"
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"It is, it is, and it is worth it."
"I've noticed that, I've noticed it."
"Yeah. And it is hard, and I-I think it gets better. My experience was it got a little better the freshman and sophomore year, you know."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"But I think you are hanging in there beautifully, and I love hearing that you're involved in swimming and some other things 'cause they must help connect you up with some pretty- I would hope-"
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
What do you mean by “unintelligible”?
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
Thank you very much for your time and your support.
Do you want to know what your values are?
"My top value is family happiness, that's-"
What is number one and what is number two and why?
I usually do this values clarification sheet every two to three months.
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"-just to see if anything has changed, and every time it has changed."
What is the most important thing in your life?
Is there any way to know if you have any questions about this?
What is family happiness and how can it be achieved?
"It's the most important because it's a little lacking, so I know that that is something that is very important to me."
Is there anything you would like to talk about?
"I feel like my family hasn't been on one accord, so, like, if I feel like we all just can fall in the middle, which I know everybody doesn't really follow that track. So, I think for my part, I can't change anybody, is to be more present and, um, just listen and understand my family members and-and be able to voice what I feel as far as how important family happiness-happiness is to me."
Mm. Because maybe they don't know it's important to you.
Is there any way to know if you have any questions about this?
Is that what you're saying? Do you think it's true?
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
What do you want people to know about you and why?
"""And I want them to know how important it is to me, especially now,"" he said."
Huh. Uh-huh. What do you mean?
"And, um, these are definitely different from-"
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
I usually pick what I like to pick for my dinner.
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
"Um, and then the second one I said is religion. Um, it was number one at first, but somehow with a big situation that happened in my family you lose sight of your faith a little bit, which is normal. And not a lot of people-- They, uh-- Well, in my church home, it just seems like, ""Oh, you lost touch of God, Oh my gosh, you're the devil."""
Huh. Uh-huh. What do you mean?
"I feel like my faith is still there, you know?"
"Right. So, right now, it really is important to you to put the family values first?"
"I lost faith, and I'm not afraid to say it."
Huh. Uh-huh. What do you mean?
What is the difference between people that don't really feel like that's true?
"Because you know that other people experience it, too."
"I know that, I know that. How do I know?"
"""So, you know it's normal,"" he said."
"""I know that it's normal,"" he said."
But sometimes it is not something that people talk about.
"Yeah, well, it's a good thing it is a—"
"In church, especially in the church, there is a lot of diversity."
It's like a shock to them when you say something like that.
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"I have faith to keep going on, but sometimes you feel as though, where is God?"
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
How do you know if you are a girl?
And it sounds like you're at a place of acceptance about that also.
Is there any way to know if you have any questions about this?
"It's okay with you, and you know that it's gonna change because of your, uh, experience."
Is there any way to know if you have any questions about this?
"You've done numerous values clarification handouts, every time they're different-"
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
-so you know that it is going to change.
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
What is the difference between accepting that and accepting it?
"At first I was like, ""Whoa,"" I think I was focused too much on the first time I did it."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
-then the second time that I did it -- I did five of these total-
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"The second time that I did it I was so focused on, ""What did I read last time?"""
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
So I went ahead and blanked that out and I just went and I-
Is there any way to know if you have any questions about this?
"-compared and I was like, ""Oh wow,"" I said."
"I really applaud you for being open-minded enough to realize that where you are now is not necessarily where you have been, that you don't have to always have it be the same."
Is it normal to feel like you're not normal?
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"But, I noticed people go through things every day. I went through things in life that are gonna change."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"Things do not stay the same. Um, you know, like, you may be here, you're gonna go there, you are gonna go over there, not necessarily saying you're going to fall down, but your view of life changes the more experience, the more life, every day-"
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"-every day your eyes -- Well, to me, my eyes have gotten broader, and broader and broader. So—"
"Right, right. Right, right, right and left."
"I don't limit myself to change anymore, I just fill it out, and then I'm like, ""Okay."""
All right. All right. How do I proceed?
"That's cool, so I will focus more on that, than on the unnecessary stuff in my life."
Do you feel like you're on target with your values?
"It was kind of out of place for me, because when I did this one in particular, I stated that there were -- The other three were important to me, but I haven't focused on it so I'm like, ""Okay, it's important to you,"" so I lost track of that and the other three—"
What is the other three and how do they compare to them?
"Number three was health, and number three was safety."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
Number four is inner harmony and Number five is security.
"Inner harmony, health and security-inner harmony-"
Is there any way to know if you have any questions about this?
-are the other three?-are they the same three?
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
Which is the top two: family happiness and religion?
"And religion, and religion and politics and culture and religion."
"What is Inner harmony, health and Inner harmony?"
What is the importance of security in the world?
What is the importance of security in the world?
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"Inner harmony, health and security, harmony, harmony and security."
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
You feel like you're not paying as much attention as you would want to?
"Yeah, because when I saw it I was like, “Okay, yeah, that's one, that’s one, and that is one.”"
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
But it is still true that it is true that—
Is it because a lot of your time is being spent with the first two?
A lot of my time is being taken with number one especially-
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"-and, uh, I learned about self-esteem."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
I've been definitely esteeming others-and I've been also esteeming myself.
"""Uh. Uh. Uh."" Uh. Huh."
I have had less time to have inner harmony.
The family has been so much coming first that you have taken a back seat.
Is there any way to know if you have any questions about this?
How can I know if you're not even on the schedule?
"Most of it goes to everything else, but not to me."
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
"And, uh, like I don't even—"
It's going to be hard to achieve inner harmony-
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"If you're always running around taking care of everybody, how do you do it?"
And I feel like inner harmony comes with sleep. I haven't been able to sleep lately.
"Right, right. Right, right, right and left."
"But, um-But, but, Um-"
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"-I think that's the first step, but I just, like-- Oh my gosh, I'm just overwhelmed, um, I would like to gain that inner harmony, inner peace-"
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
"""I was just so free-spirited, open-minded. I was living life, now that I look at it as a fairy tale,"" he said."
Mm. Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"""This is not a fairy tale,"" I said. Um, you're now on board."""
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
"""This is not about you, you know, this is about everyone else."""
Mm. So something dramatic happened to you?
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
That kind of shocked you out of your fairy tale life-
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
How can I take care of everyone else thing?
Is there any way to know if you are a virgin?
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
"-definitely, and the shock keeps getting."
"I really enjoyed having the time to talk to you about your values. I hope that it's been helpful to you, and in the future, if I can support even any way in helping some of those other values get a little bit more attention, we can talk about that next time."
"""Thank you for listening,"" he said. ""Thank you."""
All right? All right? You are welcome.
What do you think of Mr. Johnson’s death?
What is the best way to answer a question in a conversation?
I'm here to talk to you about your cholesterol and the medicine your doctor prescribed.
"""I talked with my doctor about my medicine. That's his job,"" he said."
"But that's my job too, to-to help you understand how to use your medicine and give you information about getting the most benefits from it."
"I know I got high cholesterol, I've got to get that down, but on the other hand, this medicine can cause some severe muscle weakness and I just can't afford that, so you know."
How can I know if my cholesterol remains elevated?
"""Yeah, down the line, but-"""
"The side effect is something that's very, very rare, it's not really something you need to worry about, and the risk of stroke or heart attack is much worse."
"It's the muscle weakness that I'm concerned about, and that's the present, you know, that I've got to do my job."
How do you know if you feel muscle weakness?
Why don't you just give me the medicine?
How do I know if I have muscle weakness?
“I’m fine. Just—”
"It's-it's not permanent, it's just temporary."
Is there any way to know what is going on in the world?
"A stroke is much worse, so make sure you go ahead and pick up your medicine as you're going out and, uh, one-one every day to get your cholesterol down."
"OK, sure. Fine, fine, fine."
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
"Kaylie, it looks like you're here to pick up a prescription."
"""Yeah. My doctor said that he called something in."
Do you know how you're supposed to take the medication?
Does it really matter if you're a gay guy or not?
What are the side effects of taking it once a day?
Is there any way to know if you are gay or not?

Why am I taking this medication and why do I have to take it?
"It's for your dyslipidemia, just one tablet a day. Do you have any questions for me?"
Is there any way to know if this is true?
"All right, great. Have a good day."
"Kaylie, I see you're here to pick up a prescription."

I take this once a day. Did he tell you what side effects to expect?
Is there any way to know if you are gay or not?

"All right. Well, have a good afternoon."
"Hi Kaylie, I'm Lori, the pharmacist here at Bulldog Pharmacy. I see that you have a new prescription for cholesterol statin 20 called in by Dr. Ferris. I wondered if you had a minute to talk to me. I just want to make sure that you know how best to take it, and if you have any questions."
"""I'm just getting a few groceries,"" he said."
What did the doctor tell you about cholesterol statin?
He told me that I had a blood test for cholesterol and that I should start taking this.
How did your doctor tell you to take this medicine?
"He didn't really tell me, he just phoned it in."
"How can I take cholesterol statin 20 one time a day by mouth, and I can take that with or without food?"
I take all of my other medications right before bed. So I guess I could take it then.
What is the best way to take cholesterol statin?
"I keep my medications in my nightstand, right by my bed."
Do you have any children living in your home?
Is there any way to know if you are gay or not?
"Well, then that sounds like a perfect location for you. Medicines keep best if stored away from light and heat and moisture. What did the doctor tell you to expect in terms of side effects?"
"He didn't mention anything about that, or anything about it."
"All right. Well, this medication is pretty well tolerated, which means it doesn't have very many side effects. But you might experience some mild muscle aches and pains. If they seem really severe to you, then you should call Dr. Ferris and talk to him about that. Also, this medicine can interact with a lot of other medications, and even over the counter things. So check with the doctor or myself before you start anything new. And lastly, grapefruit juice may interact with cholesterol statin 20. So if you're using it every day, I probably would switch to a different juice while you"
Can you repeat to me how you take this medicine?
"I'm just gonna take one tablet right before I go to bed with my other medications. And I guess I will switched to orange juice. If I notice any muscle pain that is severe, I'll call Dr. Ferris right away."
"Kaylie, what other questions do you have for me?"
"""I think you answered all my questions. Thank you."""
"""Fantastic. All right. Well, here's your prescription,"" he said. ""I even put it on auto fill for you so that it will be filled every month."""
"I'm Lori, the pharmacist here at Bulldog Pharmacy. I see that you have a new medication to pick up today. Called in by Dr. Ferris for cholesterol statin 20. Do you have time to talk about it?"
"""I'm just getting a few groceries,"" he said."
What did the doctor tell you about cholesterol statin?
I had a blood test for cholesterol so I should start taking this medication.
How did the doctor tell you to take this medicine?
"He didn't tell me, he just phoned me in."
"What is the best way to take cholesterol statin 20 one time a day by mouth, and you can take that with or without food?"
I take all my other medications right before bed. So I guess I could take it then.
"That's perfect. This medication can be taken at any time of the day, but it does work best if taken in the evening, and it is important to take it every day."
Where do you store your medications and how can I store them?
I store them all on the nightstand by my bed.
Do you have children in your house? How do you raise them?
"""I don't have any kids,"" he said."
"All right. So that sounds like a perfect place for you to store those. Medications are best stored away from light, heat and moisture."
What did your doctor tell you about side effects?
"He didn't mention anything about that, or anything about it."
"All right. Well, this medication is usually well tolerated, which means that it doesn't have very many side effects, but you might experience some muscle aches or pains. If they seem really severe to you, then you should call Dr. Ferris and talk to him about that. Also, it can interact with over-the-counter medicines or even other medications. So before you start something new, you should check with either Dr.Ferris or myself."
Can you repeat to me how you are going to take this medicine?
"I'm just gonna take one tablet of the cholesterol statin in the evening with all my other medications. And I guess I should switch to orange juice. And if I notice any bad muscle pains, then I'll be sure to call Dr. Ferris right away."
"That's great, Kaylie. I know we went over a lot, what questions do you still have for me?"
"I think you answered all my questions, thank you."
"All right, good. Well, here's your prescription. I even put it on autofill for you so it'll be ready at the same time every month for you. If you have any questions later, our phone number is right here on the bottle, and you can call me at any time. Thanks so much. Have a great day."
"Hi, Dr. Martin. I heard you had a question for me. What do you want to talk about?"
"I'm sorry, but are you the pharmacist?"
"It's an antidepressant and comes in 10, 20, and 40 milligram strengths. It's excreted in the urine and has a half-life of about 35 hours. For side effects, there are sexual side effects and stomach side effects."
I just wanted to know if it interacts with phenelzine.
"""I think that should be fine,"" he said."
Thanks for that. I have an appointment to run.
"All right, thanks. Can you call me anytime?"
"Hi, Mrs. Smith. I wanted to let you know that we're giving Lilly some vaccines."
I don't know if I'm comfortable with that. I've been reading a bunch of stuff about them lately.
Can you tell me more about your views on vaccines?
I was just reading that it's better to let them build up their immunity naturally and stuff in their immune systems.
So you were thinking that maybe exposing Lily naturally to these diseases would be a better choice than using vaccines to get stronger?
"Yeah. I mean, I had chickenpox as a kid and now I'm immune. Right? So."
Do you think it's okay if I offer you a little bit more information about the other vaccines that we're going to give Lily today?
"""Uh, okay,"" he said. ""What is it?"""
"So, uh, before vaccines were developed, often when children had natural exposure to some of these diseases, they ended up with, sometimes death, disability, measles caused brain damage and, sometimes deafness and blindness. Polio caused paralysis in children."
I didn't realize it was so dangerous. I have never heard of polio.
What do you think of the idea of vaccines for children?
"I guess it's okay. I mean, I just want her to be healthy and safe."
It's really important for you to make sure that she's protected and that you make good decisions and do your research before making any medical decisions for her.
"""I just want to do what's right,"" he said."
"Hi, my name is Terri, I'm one of the nurses who works with Dr. Fields."
"I remember you. Yeah, we met before."
When was the last time you were in last place?
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"And I know that, uh, Dr. Fields talked with you last time about maybe trying a tai chi class to see how that would go, and I wanted to-to check in with you and see how Tai chi goes."
"Well, I went once, but I never went there."
Huh. Uh-huh. What do you mean?
"Yeah and, um, it was very beautiful to see and the instructor was very nice and I felt kind of self-conscious because I'm still in my walker."
Huh. Uh-huh. What do you mean?
I had to sit in the chair. I couldn't do what they were doing.
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"So, it's just that it was self-conscious."
How did you feel about the instructor in the class?
"I'm a lot self-conscious, I'm self conscious."
"A lot of self-conscious, uh-huh."
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
What were you hoping to achieve with Tai chi?
I was really hoping that I could get to the point where I could benefit from what they had to offer.
"So, you were hoping that it would help with balance, but you didn't see the results you were looking for?"
"Not yet, not yet, or at least not yet."
"Not yet, not yet, or at least not yet."
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
What is your overall goal and what is it?
"I wanna go home, I wanna go to bed."
Huh. Uh-huh. What do you mean?
Do you really believe in reincarnation of Jesus?
What is it that is important to you to get home?
"""I want to be with my little dog,"" he said."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
He's really cute and I miss my garden.
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"I just miss being independent, going to sleep when I want to sleep and getting up when I need to get up and cooking for myself."
"Is it possible to get home to your dog, your garden, back to your life?"
Is there any way to know if you have any questions about this?
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
How can I achieve my goal of getting home?
"I told them that I need to be able to walk down the hallway and back, even with the walker, being secure and not with the wobblies."
Huh. Uh-huh. What do you mean?
I haven't gotten there yet. And I don't know if I can get there.
What should I do in order to get home from work?
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
Huh. Uh-huh. What do you mean?
"I-I don't want to fall, I want to stay."
Huh. Uh-huh. What do you mean?
"I-I have had friends that had that happen. So, I-I agree a little, with some hesitation, but I do agree."
How is physical therapy going for you and how does it go?
"""Oh, it's better,"" he said."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"It still hurts. It's getting better. I'm getting better, it's not quite as painful as it was."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"Yeah, so- and so-and so-"
"So, it sounds like you're making some progress in physical therapy."
Is there any way to know if you have any questions about this?
-and you were hoping that Tai chi would help you with the wobblies. Uh-huh?
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
Are you interested in going back to tai chi?
"I'm not making much sense, but I do."
It's important that you know that you're the one who has to make the decision about whether or not tai chi works for you.
I don't really know yet what I'm going to know.
Huh. Uh-huh. What do you mean?
"I can't say it does or does not, but you know it didn't that one time."
"So, you haven't seen the results you want yet-"
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
-but because Dr. Fields recommended it and your friend has-
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
- and it sounds like you like the instructor--
"""I do,"" he said. ""I do."""
Is there any way to give it another chance?
"If I could, I would do it right now."
How can I get to tai chi again?
"Well, I'd have to make the arrangements again, that was a little complicated, and, um, I would have to get my head straight about feeling self-conscious, because I know that nobody's really looking at me, but I have to convince myself."
"""Uh-huh,"" he said. ""Yeah."""
"Yeah, and the arrangement is a little complicated."
How confident are you on a scale of 1 to 10 with one being not at all confident and 10 being very confident that you can make arrangements in order to get to tai chi?
What is the best way to make arrangement for an arrangement?
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
Five of the five are five-year-old girls.
Five of the five are five-year-old girls.
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"""Uh-huh, so-so-so."""
"I know I can, but it's really difficult."
What is it that makes it a five instead of a one?
"""I'm doing it by myself,"" he said."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
And I would really fe-- if I could have some sup -- like if somebody could help me do it.
Huh. Uh-huh. What do you mean?
"My-my-daughter can't visit that often and, um-"
Huh. Uh-huh. What do you mean?
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
What is the best way to feel more confident?
"If I could, I would do it alone."
Huh. Uh-huh. What do you mean?
"If I could, I would do it alone."
What is the best thing your daughter can do for you?
"Well, she can, but I'd have to wait at least a week."
What is something you would like us to help you with?
"If I could, I would do it alone."
Huh. Uh-huh. What do you mean?
"Yeah, yeah. Is that possible, is it possible?"
Sure we can make those arrangements with the rehab center. They have a van.
Huh. Uh-huh. What do you mean?
"-and-and they've done this for other patients, so we can certainly make those arrangements if you'd like."
"That would be good. And then as far as feeling self-confident, I would have to do that myself."
Are there any other barriers or obstacles to getting to tai chi?
I can't think of any. How can I think of them?
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
That's-that's the main thing-the main thing.
All right. All right. How do I proceed?
What is the arrangement of the arrangements and how do they work?
It sounds like you can see that you're making some progress in physical therapy.
Is there any way to know if you have any questions about this?
"And that you're wanting to give tai chi another chance, and that if we can help make arrangements for you to get there with the van to the rehab center, that you will give it another chance."
"That's-- Yeah, that's-- that's right."
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
"""That's true,"" he said. ""It's true."""
"Well, I'm going to go ahead and, um, I'll call the rehab center and make those arrangements."
"If you could, what would it be and why?"
"""I'm-I'm happy to do that,"" he said."
"I think that would really help, I think."
"I know you've got another follow up appointment with Dr. Fields, I'd like to check back with you then and see how class went the second time."
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
All right. All right. How do I proceed?
Yeah. Thank you for your time and your questions.
"Thank you very much for coming in today, Mrs. Smith and I look forward to hearing about the progress that you're making."
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
"Hi, Dr. Martin, I'm Lori. I'm the pharmacist on duty today. I understand that you have some questions about the medication citalopram. Do you have a minute to talk about that?"
"Yeah, I do, just for a couple of minutes though."
All right. Do you have any specific questions?
"I'm not familiar with the medication, I'm just unfamiliar with it."
"Citalopram is an SSRI medication. Its indication is for depression and it is typically dosed as a 20-milligram tablet but it is available as 10, 20 and 40 milligrams. Any patients started on this medication should be monitored for improvement in symptoms in four to eight weeks."
What are the side effects of side effects and how can they be treated?
"If you have a patient suffering from any of these things, you can either decrease the dose or change them to a different agent. Do you have any other questions?"
What is the interaction between phenelzine?
How can I get back to you later this afternoon with that answer?
Is there any way to know if this is true or not?
"""Fantastic. Thank you,"" he said."
Thank you very much for your time and your support.
Did you like how your parents raised you and how did you raise you?
Tell me about how your parents raised you and how you raised yourself?
How do you feel about how you have been feeling lately?
"I guess I've been getting bigger, I guess."
"Mm, what's that like for you? What is it like?"
"It's scary, I guess, but not scary."
What is it that makes you feel uncomfortable with changes in your body?
"I know there's something in there, I just don't know much about him."
Mm. is the same time as Mm.
I know you want me to see the doctor but I haven't called yet.
Why do you think it makes you afraid to call?
"I don't know, it seems overwhelming to me."
What are some of the things that seem overwhelming to you?
I hate making phone calls. I know I need to fill out all this paperwork. I don't know how to get there and I hate needles.
"Is there any sense of being overwhelmed or about the logistics of the appointment, and some of it is that you don't like medical appointments and medical people?"
Is there any way to know if you have any questions about this?
What is the best way to help me with this?
Can you help me make a call to a friend?
"If we can do that together, how can we do it together?"
How can I go with you to the appointment?
What is the best way to support someone who can go with you to support you?
"Hello, Rick. Welcome to the world of gaming."
Kia ora ora is a Japanese anime series.
"Good to see you here. I see that you're, uh, [unintelligible 00:01:18]."
"Yup. That's right, that is right."
What part of the [unintelligible 00:01:22] is you from?
"I'm from down south, I'm from up south."
"""Oh, okay,"" he said. ""I'm sorry."""
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
Right down the bottom? Down the Bluff or Down Bluff
I'm from Invercargill just short of Bluff. All my family is still down there.
"Oh, are they? So you were born in there and-"
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
-raised down there? What is it like to be raised up there?
"""Mm-hmm. Country boy,"" he said."
Have you been up in Christchurch for a long time?
I've been up there since I was 18.
How long has it been since you came here?
"Just a little while. Yeah, just a little."
"""Oh good, you got family out here?"""
I'm just my own. How do I know that?
I'm sort of interested in what sort of thoughts you have on your way here today.
"I was thinking about what you might ask me, what you would say. I'm thinking about my kids, thinking about having to take a day off work."
"Right, right. Right, right, right and left."
"""It's a bit of a bitch,"" he said."
I see you've had a bit of experience with prevention services.
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
What's it been like in the past for you?
"""It's been okay. Um, it hasn't been bad."""
"Right, right. Right, right, right and left."
"I don't know, kind of nothing, really."
What is the same sort of offending in the past that has brought you back again?
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"What are some of the things that I have learned over the years, Rick?"
I hope it says that I want to make some changes.
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
Is it different from when you came in here before?
"Yeah, and I still had to walk through those doors so-"
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"-but, you know, I just think about my kids."
"Yeah. So they're really important, right?"
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
Yeah. And do you have kids with you full-time or-
"No, I don't. I see them about once a fortnight."
What is it like for you to live in the US?
"It sucks, it sucks, and it sucks too."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
What would you like to happen to your children?
"I just want to be able to see them whenever I can, whenever I want to."
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"You know, I, um, they're my whole world and I've fucked things up."
"Right, right. Right, right, right and left."
"""So, you know,"" he said, ""I know."""
"So coming along to see me and you and I are doing some work together, then you're going to do a program, how important is that for you and your children?"
"""It's really important,"" he said. ""It's important."""
"If you had a scale of 1 to 100, what would you be?"
"It's, uh, um, it's hard because-because I'm not a bad person. I've just done some stupid shit, but I’m not a terrible person."
"Right, right. Right, right, right and left."
"In regards to my kids, I would be 100- 100%."
"Right, right. Right, right, right and left."
"If it means say, I can have my children whenever I want whenever I can."
"What do you think it would be like for your kids to hear you say that this was really, really important to you and to them?"
I'd hope that they'd be proud of me. I wouldn't want my kids to see me- to see them here though. But I- I hope they would be proud.
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
"'Cause I'm-- Yeah, I am."
Anybody else in your family would be really proud that you're taking these steps?
My mom is my mom. How do I know her?
How do you know if your mother is still down south?
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
Is there any way to know that you are here today?
Is there any way to know if you are gay or not?
How might it be for her if she knew that you're talking like this?
"Yeah, I am. And I am very proud of it."
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"I just, I don't know where to start."
What is the best way to start this program?
So I hope so. I want to do something to help myself.
"I'm just wondering if you and I are going to be doing a little bit of work together then. And, um, and sometimes it-it can get quite tough. And I'm just curious before we go any further, when the going gets tough, a lot of guys bail out."
"""This is important to me,"" he said."
"Right, right. Right, right, right and left."
"I have, um, I've -- it's important to me."
One of the other things we're really conscious of is that sometimes we do this work in isolation from others. And one of the things we want to ask people is who they're going to be accountable to.
I am separated at the moment from my missus and-
What was your partner's name and what was their name?
"Kirsty. Uh, Kirsty. What do you think?"
Kristy is married to Kristy and has two children.
"I would- I would love f-f-for her to know that I'm doing this and that I mean it, but I know she wouldn't give a shit right now actually."
"In terms of your employer, would they support you?"
I don't know if I want them to know.
What do you think it might be like to explore that?
I don't know. What do you think of it?
Any other family members that live close that you think would be supportive?
"""I'm pretty much by myself up here,"" he said."
"Why do I have to ask this, Rick, and why do I need to be responsible?"
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
The other aspect of that is kind of like who we're going to be accountable to while we're doing the program?
I don't know. I don't have that many people.
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
"I don't know that I am-- I don't have that many people I trust to support me. My mates, I love them, but, um, yeah, I know."
"Okay. So as we're gonna do this work together and go through this, uh, this program, one of the things we don't want to do is fall into the same trough we did last time. How does that sound to you?"
"""Yeah, let's give it some thought,"" he said."
Do you think you're kind of padding this walk a little bit on your own at the moment?
"Yeah. That'll definitely be true, that'll be true."
"My family is down south. I mean, who-who-who else do you think would be really interested in supporting you, rowing with you if you like on this journey?"
"Uh, I have a good relationship with my mum."
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
- with my brothers and sisters-with my sisters and brothers.
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"""My mum is actually pretty important to me,"" he said."
"How would it be for your mum, do you think, if you were to tell her that this is something that you're really important for you and that you know that this time you really need to do this for her and for the family?"
"""I think she'd be proud of me,"" he said."
All right. All right. How do I do?
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
How would you feel if you were to make this journey?
"Yeah. Yeah. And a good, uh, good family."
"How would you go about getting them to support you, to come on board and be accountable to doing this work together?"
I don't know. I have some-somebody just to listen.
"I mean, what do you think your mom would say to you if she was sitting here with us now and she heard you talking about this?"
She would- she would tell me that she loves me and that she believes I could do it.
What do you think she might want for you?
"""For them to have a father they can look up to,"" he said."
I'm getting a strong sense that is what you want as well.
It is what I want. It is exactly what I have wanted.
Where do you think your confidence level is now?
"If I had their support of my-my-family and [silence] I want to say that would be higher. I just know I fucked it up in the past. If they were there to support me now, then I’d be 99 percent sure."
How important is getting your family on board to get your whānau on board?
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
What do you know about flu shots and how do they work?
Why do old people feel like they need it?
"Mm, Um, so you're thinking it's just for people who are vulnerable to illness?"
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"If I shared a little more information about the flu vaccine, would it be okay?"
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
"We know that you're young and healthy and you don't have a lot of complicating illnesses that mean you would probably do okay if you got the flu. But we do know that the elderly are more at risk, pregnant people, babies are at risk of having serious complications from the flu, and by getting the vaccine, that helps prevent you from passing it on to other people."
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
How do you feel about the idea of flu vaccines?
My grandparents probably won't handle the flu very well-
Mm. is the same time as Mm.
"My co-worker is pregnant, and my co-workers too."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
I guess I should get it for their sake.
"I've got some people in my life who are vulnerable to possible illness, and making this decision to get the flu shot will help protect them."
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
I am Julie Thompson. How do you know me?
Mm-hmm. Yeah. How do I know?
"Hi, I'm Bruce Berger. I work in the clinic and I noticed that you're in to pick up a prescription for Sarah's, uh, rescue inhaler."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
I noticed that she's been in the emergency room five times in the last year for her asthma. What's that been like?
"Yeah, it's been difficult. Um, I hate to see her gasping for breath. And, you know, I'm really worried when she has to go. Uh, so that's been really difficult."
You're willing to do whatever you can to prevent that from happening.
Mm-hmm. Yeah. How do I know?
I-I also noticed that it has been about three months or so since you picked up the prescription for her chronic inhaler.
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
Are you having some difficulties with that and how can you overcome it?
"Well, I did research on the chronic inhaler and I found out that there were steroids in it and that I don't want her to take steroids. I did, uh, research on some of the potential side effects and the health problems that can result from taking steroids and I-I just do not want her taking those at all. I don’t want her exposed to them."
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
"""I just want to let you know that right off."""
You're worried about her asthma and you're working hard to keep your smoking away from her so that it doesn't affect her asthma.
Mm-hmm. Yeah. How do I know?
"Yeah. Uh, would you mind if we talked a little bit about the chronic inhaler and the medicine that you're concerned about with steroids?"
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"So, even though this medicine isn't the-the medicine that's in this is in the same broad family as the steroids you're worried about, those are calledabolic steroids."
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
What build people up and have masculinizing effects?
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"If-if-if I can draw an analogy-- again, even though this medicine is in the same family as those big broad-broad family. If I could draw a analogy, a grape and a watermelon are the same species of fruits, you know, and obviously, grape is much smaller than watermelon. And if you eat one grape, you'd be fine. If you ate an entire watermelon, it can make you very sick."
"Well, I-I guess I didn't realize that steroids weren't the same thing as anabolic steroids."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
What are the ones that cause all the problems and everything?
"I mean, definitely would not. I mean, probably you saw the name corticosteroid and thought, ""uh-oh."""
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
I do want to reassure you that this is medication that only goes to her lungs and won't get in her body and they're not the same kind of drugs as the ones you're worried about.
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
What does your daughter's lungs look like when she's having these inflammations and needing to go to the emergency room?
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"When somebody has asthma, their lungs are like hypersensitive. If I could use an analogy, again, if you had skin burned off your arm, if somebody brushed up against you before he had the skin burned, it wouldn't bother you at all. But when the skin is burned off, your lungs are exquisitely sensitive."
"""Oh, okay,"" he said. ""I'm sorry."""
And so this chronic inhaler can prevent that from happening. Okay?
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"The other thing I was going to tell you is that, unfortunately, even though you are smoking outside and keeping the smoke away from her, the smoke on your clothes can also affect her lungs and cause her to have a reaction."
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"Uh, and it would certainly help her. Um, but what I'd like you to do is to, kind of, keep an eye on what happens when she uses the chronic inhaler. And if she's still flaring up when you're around her. If there are any, if there is smoke on your clothes because it can flare up."
What is it that I can wear on my clothes?
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, Yeah. And that's it."
She's that sensitive. If I realized that I would—
"It-it-it-- Yeah. It may not- it may not when she uses the chronic inhaler, but you'll need to keep an eye on that."
"Yeah, so would it help to quit smoking?"
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"But I know people who tried to quit and it's really difficult, you know. So I know, it'd be better."
It's very hard. It's very relaxing and-
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
And it's hard to replace something with something.
"Yeah, it is. Um, it's. Um."
How can I help you if you don't choose to quit right away?
"Do you think that it affects her that it's on my clothes, if I only smoked while she was at school and then changed my clothes before she came home?"
"If you could smoke in the house, that sounds like it would be great."
"Oh, absolutely. I never. never. Ever."
"If you're willing to do that, that would certainly help."
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
"I mean, if you get to the point sometime down the road where you're willing to quit for both you and her, we'd be glad to help you do that."
Yeah. [chuckles] Yeah. [Chuckles]
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
"""It's really difficult,"" he said, """
So it sounds like you're willing to-to have her use the chronic inhaler-
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"-to try to get the inflammation down, so she doesn't need to go to the emergency room and do whatever you can at this point to keep the smoke off your clothes."
Is there any way to know if you are gay or not?
"Yeah, because you'll get rid of that inflammation."
"""Oh, that's great,"" he said."
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
-because that is always scary when she has to use that one.
Yeah. So we're going to go ahead and get both of those prescriptions ready.
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
"Use the chronic inhaler every day, keep the rescue inhaler around if she needs it, and let's see how that works."
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
What is the best way to answer a question in a good way?
"""That sounds good. Thank you,"" he said."
"All right. Good. All right, good, good."
"Hi, Sal, thanks for coming in today."
"""No problem,"" he said, ""no problem."""
I saw you made the referral and I appreciate you taking the time to come and make that appointment.
"Yeah, it's-it's a bit of an inconvenience I would say, but I'm here though."
So you made it in here and made it here?
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
Do you have a sense of what the doctor's concerns were that led her to refer you?
Is there anything that can be done to change the smoking habits in my life?
So your asthma has been acting up and there's a lot of stuff going on?
What is the stress of my life right now?
Mm-hmm. Almost—almost.
"Yeah, it's a lot, but it's worth it."
"It sounds almost overwhelming it sounds like, but it does."
"Yeah, yeah, it is overwhelming. And it is."
"If we took a couple of minutes and just kind of looked at all of the different things that are going on for you, what would be the best thing to spend time on?"
"Yeah, it just feels like everything's all over the place but we got to start somewhere."
"Well, one of the things that we use are these -- it's kind of like a worksheet and it's an agenda-setting worksheet basically."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"If you could list all of the different things that people around you are saying that you need to work on or that you should change, what would some of those things be?"

"""He's saying it's a main contributor to asthma problems."""

"I don't- I don't buy it and I can't just get rid of him like that, but it's there."
It's pretty shocking to be told you have to get rid of your dog.
I know the dog has been there before my wife. I know I've had him longer.
"So that's a huge stress right now, what is it?"

Right. Right. So the appointments and time.
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"Um, and some of these things are kind of related to each other that we're already seeing."
"Yeah, yeah. Yeah, there's something going on. And I got to cut down my drinking too."
"So there's a lot happening right now, Sal. Anything else that's concerning you?"
"It's just overwhelming when you see everything they're, you know?"
"I mean, where would you like to start?"
"I think the thoughts about the dog have been definitely bothering me, that's been one."
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
"And, um, my asthma is out of control too, so maybe those two."
And those are ones that are pretty related to each other-
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
- sounds like. Okay. So what do you think?
"I understand that your asthma symptoms have been out of control. So, we need to look at some of the ways that you can get healthy and not be back here again."
"Yeah, I de-I don't wanna come back here. But, uh, the doc said Oscar, my dog, is connected to my asthma symptoms. But the-"
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"-ridiculous part is I had him for 12 years before, and now it's a problem."
"But I'm sure that you've seen some of the material that the clinic gave to you about asthma symptoms and managing your asthma, and pets are a really big source of problems in that respect."
"Yeah, but I have seen the materials, I have them-"
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
-I have even read them. All I've been doing is taking the medicine. So I don't know that much about this.
"Well, I'm just really taken aback by that because I understand from your chart that you have a young child-"
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
I have a new baby. How is it going?
"John Carlo, yeah. How do you describe John Carlo?"
"-and you are very concerned about your health, you wanna be there for your baby and that you have already taken some steps, you've already quit smoking-"
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
I know it's hard to do that. But there are always people who will adopt animals and I'm sure that you have friends or family members.
"I'm a little too much for me now. First of all, John Carlo is taken care of, that's fine. He doesn't have asthma from the dog. It's just me. I don't ha—"
"It's not you that I'm worried about, Sal. It's you, okay? The symptoms are worse. You've had two or three major asthma attacks. And do you appreciate how-- this is, uh, a risk to your life that there are some-some adults with severe asthma who actually can die as a result of their symptoms? It-it truly is something to take very seriously."
"So, Oscar is going to make me die?"
"What does it mean that your asthma is progressively getting worse, and that you know very well that the strength of the medication is getting higher and higher, and there's only so much that can be done with medication alone."
"I can keep giving me more medicine and give me the strongest one, and I'll keep Oscar."
"""Sal, you're almost on the strongest one."""
"I understand, but I don't think you understand my situation. I've had this dog for 12 years. So, I'm not just gonna up and get him out of my house when I don’t even know if that’s the main thing."

"OK, that's fine. So, Barbara, I'm seeing you today, but I think it's usually Dr. Brown that sees you, is that right?"
"""Dr. Brown is my doctor,"" Dr. Brown said."
What is it that brought you to see me?
"I have a tummy problem. I've got terrible trouble with my stomach and Dr. Brown just doesn't seem to be able to get to the bottom of it. And I thought perhaps, uh, I'd come and see you to see if you could help."
Can you tell me more about tummy problems?
"Um, well, I have this terrible discomfort nearly all the time. Um, it very often feels bloated. I, um, I swing between being constipated and having diarrhea. I have sort of cramping feelings sometimes, and other times it stabs. It's a real stabbing feeling. I often have the urge to go to the toilet and I pass very smelly wind."

I used to go to Swing and Shape. I used to take an exercise class.

"For my first DUI, I did not drink at all for about six months. And, you know, I-I just didn't think that, um, I really had a problem with it, so I did start drinking again."
"Six months. That's a long time, right?"
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
What was the six months of your life like?
I know it was weird. My friends didn't really hang out with me too much. Um--
What is the best way to meet a friend and why?
"Yeah. You know, I, uh, I know."
"Whi-which? If you don't mind me asking, which friends were those?"
"My friends, my friends, are not my friends anymore."
"-social circles. Okay, okay, okay."
"I'm just my social circle, I guess, uh--"
What do you think made them not hang out with you?
"Probably “cause I didn't- I wasn't drinking with them, I guess.”"
What was the question you asked to ask someone?
No. I really couldn't because my girlfriend really wouldn't let me hang with them. You know?
And your girlfriend is important to you and your girlfriend-
Is there any way to know if you have any questions?
"-and that relationship was important to you, and important to that relationship."
"Well, it was until she left you know, you know."
"""At the time it was important, yeah,"" he said."

Why did she leave? Why did she do it?
"""She left when I started drinking again,"" he said."
How long does it take to get pregnant after six months of pregnancy?
She decided not to continue with the relationship after six months.
Do you remember when you started drinking again and then left?
"It was about the same time. I really don't know which came first. Uh, we were getting in a lot of arguments. I just didn't quite feel myself. You know, I-I-I wasn't-- My friends weren't around. I missed going out with them."
What was it like to feel isolated in your life?
"It was weird 'cause I felt like she was trying to control me, and, uh- and uh, you know, I, uh-- And she was telling me what to do all the time, and I just didn't feel right about the whole situation. So, it was pretty much, we both decided that it was just wasn't the right thing to do, so."
And so you're-you're an independent guy.
Is there any way to know if you have any questions?
No one is going to tell you what to do.
What do you think of it? How do you feel about it?
"So you started drinking again, and that was-- If you could just give me a little timeframe of how long ago that was, that-that six months of complete--"
"Let's see. The first one was, uh, three years ago, and then the second was a few weeks ago, so, um, it's been a few years, you know."
Do you think it is possible to do this in the future?
Yeah. It's been a few years since I've been here.
"So, in-in what ways has drinking been bad?"
"Do you drink to be social, you know, I don't know that it really changes anything about me?"
What are some of the friends that were not hanging around with you?

"I mean, if they wouldn't have gave me those shots, you know, towards the end of the night, I would've been all right. You know, I could have drove, and I would't have hit that mailbox."

"I think she just wanted to control me, and I was tired of being controlled."
"No one likes to be controlled, Uh, yeah. Uh, and, in what ways, did you feel controlled at any time?"

"So, what does serious look like? Um --"
I don't want to date someone on a regular basis. I don't really feel like I want to be in a committed relationship.
"Yeah. That's all right, yeah, that's good. It sounds like you know yourself pretty well."

What would you do differently from here on now?
I think I would like to really think about--
"Since the court sent you, we have to sort of explore what would happen if you went out and did this again."
"You know, I mean I-I, uh- I don't drink as much, and if I did, I would call, uh, a taxi or, um, you know, get some kind of a ride home, I think, 'cause I don’t wanna get in trouble."
Is there anybody that you could call to make a call?
"Uh, I don't really think about that. I guess I would have to think about it, because if I was gonna go out and drink, I should have to consider that."
"Right, right. Right, right, right and left."
I guess I could call it a taxi cab.
"""They'll come,"" he said. ""They will."""
"I think that will be something, I think."
"Yeah. They'll come as long as you got the money, they'll come and get you."
"If I take some money, I'll put it in my wallet-"

"What is that? What is it, and how does it work?"

"That makes sense, that makes a lot of sense. So then you'd have your money tucked away somewhere different."
"If I put it away, then I wouldn't spend it, you know, [unintelligible 00:18:48]"

There would be a plan that I would have to have to-

What is the best way to get home from work?
"Yeah. So, how often do you think you will be needing that plan in the future?"
"It'd probably be my wallet for a while, I would think, 'cause I don't really think I have a problem with drinking, you know. I just-"
"Right, right. Right, right, right and left."
"-think that, you know, it was a isolated incident."

What was the six months of not drinking like for you?
"It was a- it was, uh, it was pretty good. I just didn't feel like I had my friends around, and it just seemed kinda boring. I mean, I felt good physically and, uh- I was more on time to work, I was doing really good at work and so forth, but, you know, it just, um- the hard part for me was that I didn't have any friends around."
Six months is a- is a long time. Was there other people? Was it just you?

"I-I see what you're saying, for sure. Um, there's those friends that they drink but don't drink that much, I heard you saying."
"Yeah, they don't drink that much, but they seem to-- You know, like they do drink, you know."
Mm. Sure. How do I know if I'm doing?
"I mean, it is just beer. You know-"
"Right, right. Right, right, right and left."
-it's not like they're drinking whiskey or anything like that. It's not--
"Yeah. So, so-called. So-called--"
"They'll drink beer, but it's just-- You know, for me, I don't know. Sometimes, uh, I have an intention to have a couple of drinks and maybe I'll have, you know, more than a couple."

I think I can drink what? Like two or three drinks an hour?
"""It's one drink per hour,"" he said."

-pretty much everyone I know like to drink drinks.
"Yeah, so wha-what would it do to the relationship of you not drinking but still being with these folks?"
"Yeah, I, uh-uh-huh."
Would-would it work out and what would it be like?
"Do you think it's weird when I go there and hang with them at all, I-I think that it's, uh-- You know, we-you know-"
"""It's uncomfortable,"" he said. ""It's awkward."""
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. How do you know?"
What is it that makes it uncomfortable to be in public?
"They're drinking and then- and if I'm drinking soda, they kind of mess with me a little bit."
How do you know if someone is tampering with you?
"Well, they just mess with me until I drink a beer with them, you know."

My mom is your mom. How do I know her?
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
What is the best thing your mom could do for you?
"If I don't get up, she can come in and wake me up and remind me that I said to you that I'm going to get up so that I can do it."
"You want your mom to make it say that this is for you. It's not because your mom's making you get up like you want to remind you, ""Hey, remember, this is something that you want for yourself."""
"""Yup. Yup. """"Yup."""""
What could get in the way of not getting up by 6:15?
"""Not going to bed on time,"" he said."
"Not going to bed on time, or not going to sleep on time."
"Yup, that's gonna be a struggle."
"So if you are feeling tempted to stay up later, what should you do?"
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
What is the best way to respond to someone who is rude?
"Just go to bed and turn off the lights, don't have a phone."
How do I keep my phone away from my iPhone?
"""Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah,"" he said."
How do I turn the lights off and make sure it's dark?
Is there any way to know if you have any questions about this?
Kind of a reminder that it's time to go to bed.
Have my mom check on me to make sure everything is put away.
"And also the support of your mom, and also your dad."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
How do you know if your plan is working?
"When I'm at school, when the bell rings and I'm in class."
"So when the bell rings, then you know that this is the goal."
Do you think it is possible to live in the future?
"So what I've been hearing so far is what again, what a great goal. You've already had some insight of how to do this. So for you, it's really important that you're getting to your first hour because you don't want to go back to your old days. You don't like having all these extra people checking up on you and all those things."
"Well, yeah, I hope so, I think so."
What a great plan and you said you were going to start tomorrow.
"I'll give it a try, if it works."
"""Great. Well, thank you,"" he said."
"""You're welcome,"" he said. ""We're welcome."""
What's been going on in the world? What is going on?
I just want my call. That's it.
All right. I was told that you're phone calls were taken away.
"[scoffs] Yeah, yeah."
What happened? What happened? How did it happen?
"""I don't know. Some of-- One of the officers, it's like he has it out for me or something."""
"Yeah, it was weird when I got that report."
"I just want to contact my mom, that's it."
I remember you saying something about like your dad's birthday coming up?
My dad's birthday is tomorrow. How can I celebrate it?
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
"I just wanted my call so I can talk to my mom, that's it."
"I mean, it's been, um, a long time and this is the first time that we've seen this behavior from you, so I know for a lot of other guys right before they get out, it comes around because they haven't been out in a while and then the pressure of being on the outside is starting to settle in."
Hi. I am [unintelligible 00:00:02]?
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
What brings you in? What brings you into the world?
I'm supposed to come to learn about diabetes. Just got diagnosed.
"""I see that your A1C or your blood glucose is very high,"" he said."
"Yeah, that's what doctor said. She-she really laid into me about that. Said it was -- I guess, this is really serious stuff. She was talking about losing eyesight, mm, my feet, mm and problems with a lot of other stuff, and it really scared me. Uh, so, [sighs] you know, how-how-how to manage all this, I guess."
"Mm-hmm. Well, you do need to take your medicine. We, uh, will need to start dieting, you know, lose some weight, change your eating habits, exercise, to get your diabetes under control."
Is it possible to do all this stuff without getting it all done?
"So, it's possible that it can happen."
[sighs] What do you think of this?
"""We need to start looking at all those different things to get your diabetes under control,"" he said."
I-I (unintelligible 00:01:35)
"Hello, again, Mr. Green. It's really nice to see you again. If you remember last week, we looked at your results here and you've got impaired glucose tolerance and you were a bit worried about type two diabetes, your blood pressure and your cholesterol are up a bit. So today, we're meeting up to talk through some of the things that you could do for yourself that might improve your health."
Why don't you give me a row and tell me it's all self-inflicted and I can change my ways and give up the things I enjoy.
I'm not going to do that because I'm the boss. It's up to you what you want to do with your own health.
"""I've got to take pills for the rest of my life,"" he said."
"""You don't seem too happy about that,"" he said."
"""I feel fine, but the doc said it could save my life,"" he said."
"""Well, there's a lot of things that you can do yourself that will improve the situation as well,"" he said. ""What we can do today is wee up some of those things, smoking, diet, exercise, weight loss, all those kinds of things."""
What is the first thing I should do first?
I'm the boss of my own life. How do I start?
Where do you think I should start in my career?
"Well, I could give you my opinion and I can give you lots of information, but I think you know the score pretty well. And you know what I would say."
Why don’t you stop smoking and lose weight?
What do you think of stopping smoking and losing weight?
I loved losing weight but it's so hard giving up the things you enjoy.
It's really tough. It's hard to know where to start.
I really should do. Or shouldn't I do.
How important is it to lose weight and lose weight?
I'd like to see my children settled and my grandchildren growing up and I should be an example to them.
Can it be in there for your-your-family?
I want to be there for them but not a burden to them.
What is the best way to start with that?
"I've been thinking about them a lot lately, and I want to be there for them. So I have to do what I need to, to improve my health."
What is the first thing you would think about doing?
What is the best way to reduce your drinking?
Yeah. That would be a good place to start.
But I think I should cut out the booze. My wife says I drink too much at the weekends.
I think it should be really supportive of that.
I suppose I could cut out the crisps and pies at work.
How can I make sure I don't get hungry at work?
I am going to start having soup at lunchtime. I suppose a big bowl of soup would be far better than two pies.
What are some of the best ways to eat vegetable soup?
"""There's one thing I've done already, I stopped adding salt to my food,"" he said."
"Well, that's good. That's probably benefited you already. And the other thing you might not be aware of is that salt intake is linked to loss of calcium from bones, which makes bones more fragile. So reducing your salt intake will really help with that too."
"I didn't know that. Um, it's good to know. I'll tell my wife, she's still very fond of her salt and her mother had osteoporosis."
"So well, maybe you can help her as well and that would be good."
"What do you think of the figures? How do you feel about them? I feel I'm making a start but let's take it a step at a time and see how it goes. But, uh, the next day, the figures might be a lot better."
Is it possible to meet up at the same time?
"That’s fine with me, I’m fine with it."
That’s great. All the best then.
"Thanks. You too, I love you, and I miss you."
"And, uh, welcome. And, uh, welcome."
Thank you very much for your time and your support.
I'd say my name is Mark and I work for Green Prescriptions. And-
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
I know a little bit about you from a referral letter from the doctor.
Is it possible to get help from your GP?
"From your GP, yeah, from your GP."
"""Uh. Uh. Uh."" Uh. Huh."
But I want to just ask you a little bit about what led you to come here today and get a bit of an idea about what has been going on for you.
What led me to come to this place in the first place?
Mm. is the same time as Mm.
My GP is my GP. How can I know that?
What did he have to say in his speech?
"I had my sort of, you know, checkup."
What is the best way to describe your feelings about the movie?
"It revealed that I might have diabetes. Well, that's what he says."
"Right, right. Right, right, right and left."
"I think that I feel perfectly well. I-I'm, you know, I understand people with diabetes are a little bit plumper than I am."
Mm. is the same time as Mm.
"But, that's really why I'm here. I'm on his command."
"Right, so he gave you a directive, right?"
He did. He says he's going to put me on some sort of program if it gets worse.
Mm. is the same time as Mm.
"But as I say, I feel absolutely fine."
"So it was kind of a surprise, you feeling okay."
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"You go for this checkup with the doctor, and he says, ""You've got Type II diabetes."""
"""Mm, I'm very surprised,"" he said."
"Mm. Came out of the blue for you, did you?"
Do you think it did? How did it happen?
Mm. is the same time as Mm.
Mm. is the same time as Mm.
And you said you kind of don't fit that kind of Type II diabetes look. That you kinda have had this idea-
What is the difference between I- and I-?
How long has it been since you have been overweight?
"""That's what I understand,"" he said."
Mm. is the same time as Mm.
"I'm not overweight, you know, and I am not overweight."
Mm. is the same time as Mm.
"I-I sort of look after myself to a limited extent. Um, but I'm a busy person, I suppose I burn off the calories. And-"
Mm. is the same time as Mm.
"I don't know, really. How do I know?"
Mm. is the same time as Mm.
What is your lifestyle and what is it like?
"So it doesn't quite fit in your head, Type II diabetes and Type III diabetes."
Is there any way to know if you are gay or not?
What is your lifestyle and what is it like to live it?
"""No, not at all,"" he said."
What was your reaction when he told you that?
I thought he was joking. To be honest. I thought-
Mm. is the same time as Mm.
"-you know, why you are, look around you."
"Mm, mm. Mm. Mmm. mm."
"I just felt that, Um-- I mean, I don't think he was wasting my time because why would he do that?"
"Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah and yes."
What is the difference between right and wrong? Why or why not?
"He's got a lot of work to do, he said."
"Amanda, is it right to say that you are wrong?"
Mm. is the same time as Mm.
"He's got a job to do, and obviously, the tests have come through. And I have got these signs of diabetes 2."
"Right, right. Right, right, right and left."
"I just don't feel like it, Mark."
Mm. is the same time as Mm.
What is the difference between being an adult and being a child?
How is your head feeling in your head and how do you feel?
"""I feel absolutely fine,"" he said. ""I feel fine."""

"Yeah. Well, physically I feel absolutely fine."
Mm. is the same time as Mm.
I'm-I'm-- I don't see anything wrong with me at all.
What does it feel like to live in the middle of the world?
"I mean, I get around pretty well, I sleep pretty well-"

I sort of know- I sort of you know--
What does it feel like to live in the middle of the world?
- I'm-I'm Compos mentis. So I don't—
What is the problem? Mm. What are the problems?
What is the problem and how can we solve it?
How did this happen? How did it happen?
"Well, I mean, yes. I mean-"
Mm. is the same time as Mm.
I must admit that I haven't done too much research. I've been a bit busy.
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
I know he-he was saying something about family or whatever. I don't know.
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
I don't know if it is hereditary or hereditary.
Mm. is the same time as Mm.
"""I think he said something about it being hereditary."""
"It might be a family thing, and so you-"
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
- or maybe got from your parents or something of the sort.
"It could be-Yeah, it could be, but-"
Mm. is the same time as Mm.
"My mother mentioned-because, um, my mother mentioned my mother-"
Mm. is the same time as Mm.
"-that, uh, my father had diabetes."
"Right, right. Right, right, right and left."
"-diabetes 2. And if I think about it, my brother-"
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"""I haven't seen him for years,"" he said."
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
But he may well have it because he is-
Mm. is the same time as Mm.
- a pretty cuddly guy. You know-
"Right, right. Right, right, right and left."
"He's pretty big, and he's pretty skinny."
So he fits the picture-so he fit the picture.
"Well, yes, the stereotype is the stereotype."
"When you think about what he-he is, you think he's stereotypical."
"Yeah, I guess I guess, but I guess not."
"A little bit bigger, perhaps doesn't look after himself that well, and he fits that foot well."
As far as I know I hadn't seen him for-
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
I don't know how many years I have been alive.
Is there any history of diabetes in the past?
"Apparently so. Yes, apparently so, according to the source."
Doctor mentioned that as a factor in the decision.
"Mm, I mean, is it hereditary?"
"""We know that people who have had parents or have been in the past, there is a hereditary factor or genetic factor in-involved,"" he said."
Does that mean that if you've got a history of this within your family-
Mm. is the same time as Mm.
"If it's a gene, is it more likely than not to get it?"
"""Yeah,"" he said. ""Yeah, right."""
"Also, it's—and it's also—"
"It's not inevitable, but it's not impossible."
Right. Okay. So what is the difference between the two?
"Because its genes or the hereditary factor is not the only factor that causes it or is involved in it happening to you, other factors come into play."
I'm sure you're going to tell me what these are.
"Well, you've mentioned some of the things you know, and one of those is hereditary factors. You mentioned that the doctor mentioned that. What else do you know or have you heard?"
"""To be frank, Mark, I honestly don't know what causes it, because I've never had any reason,"" he said."
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"The hereditary thing I thought, well, that's the explanation."
"""That makes a bit of sense,"" he said. """
"Why go any further, if it's there, why?"

Relatives went into their 70s relatively well.
Is it helpful for you to know some of the factors involved in Type II diabetes?
What is the difference between being a boy and being a girl?

What is the best way to answer this question and why?
And see what you make of it. See if it fits a little bit more with where you're at.
"I've heard of it, I've heard about it."
So that's a hormone or a chemical that allows you to use sugar in your body.
"Right, right. Right, right, right and left."
"Type II diabetes typically people have a resistance or a resistance to insulin in their cells, in their fat cells or their muscle cells or liver cells. They can't use insulin. And so sugar builds up in your system."
Are you saying that they like they can't digest insulin?
"You need insulin in your cells, individual cells in muscle or fat or wherever to use up excess sugar or to utilize sugar."
"""I see. So-so it's like a balance,"" he said."
"""That's right,"" he said, ""that's right."""
"So insulin you-you-you, insulin you you."
"""Kind of, as your,"" he said, ""kind of."""
You have yourself drawn a bar on the wall of your house.
"Yap, Yap and Yap, yap."
What balances out in the body is the insulin taking off excess fat.
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
What is the difference between digesting or digesting?
That's a good way to think about the world.
Is that what happened to you and your family?
"In Type II diabetes, your fat cells and liver cells and muscle cells are resistant to insulin. It's almost like they're saying we can't use that."
Why is it so hard to explain to people why?
"And if there's a number of-- We're not entirely sure, there's still going on as to how this happens and how that could be modified. But what we do know is that, um, one of the key things in managing it is to try and modify or modulate, control the amount of sugar that is in your system."
Right. Okay. So what is the difference between the two?
"Yeah. So there's a couple of things that we know that people with Type II diabetes have to look after and have to think about if they want to control the amount of sugar that's in their system, which is the main issue that's causing some of the health problems that people have with diabetes."
What does it mean to be personally affected by someone's death?

Is it worse? I don't know. I-I-I suppose.

What I'm hearing is there's actually a lot of aspects in your life that are really good.
I think my life is good. My life is great.
"From your perspective, things are going well. How is it going?"
"My life is great, and then you turn around and say, ""Hey you've got-- you-you're ill, you're sick,"" and I turn around."
Yeah. It doesn't fit. How can I fix it?
"And I'm not. But you see, he said to me that he's gonna put me on some sort of, uh, a daily monitoring of sugar levels?"
Mh-hmm. How do I know?
"I'm going to have to take regular pills, and I'm gonna have to have regular pills."

Yeah. Okay. So what is the point of this?
I mean you know that I mean that you know.
"And you're here today and that's probably something in you you've thought well I'll follow this through, you know I'll-I'll come along and see what-see what they've got to say."

"You start looking at the home life of somebody else, and you're thinking, ""Hmm, I use d to have this."""
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. And that's it."
"It's nice food, isn't it? and you know."
Yeah. And your husband used to do a lot of that for you?
"Oh, she would do all the cooking. Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"I mean, I never bothered to boil an egg, you know."
And so she would look after what you ate and healthy things that you had spread out in front of you and off you go.
"I mean, I was just in charge of the wine."
Mm-hmm. Now you have to think what you might eat and sometimes you don't eat the best.

- or Kentucky Fried or whatever-or whatever.
"It's very appealing, isn't it? How is it?"
"You know, it's very easy. And then you think to yourself, well, I mean, I do think of myself that maybe I should have a few vegetables around here or whatever. But then you go out into the supermarkets, you know, and you can pick up, uh, your- one of your TV dinners."
"Mm-hmm, Mm-Hmm."
So you bring those in and you open them up and put them in the microwave and there are vegetables there.
"Yeah they look pretty good on the plate, don’t they?"

"Right, right. Right, right, right and left."
"I mean the thing is when you're a teenager, I mean, I've always smoked. So, but when you are young and you're sportsman, you know—"
You sort of juggle those two things and sort of--
"The two things balance out, you know and everybody else is balanced out."
You still run and have a cigarette. How do you do it?
"You know, you pass a cigarette down the backline almost every day, don't you?"
"Hmmm. Hmm. Yeah, part of culture."
"And it's changed a bit now, because in my day when we were playing, of course, it was a very much more social game, which was spent-spent in the rugby club."

But I enjoy smoking. I really do enjoy it. So I cut it down to about 10 a day now.
"""So you meant to reduce,"" he said. """
"Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah and yes."
"""You were noticing that it was having an impact on your breathing and health,"" he said."
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"When you related your smoking to your smoking, you managed to reduce your smoking."
"Yeah, yeah. I'm sort of like—"
So you have made your decision to do this?
"She will say, ""Why don't you give up?"""
What does it feel like to live in the middle of the world?
"It's-it's-- I enjoy it, um—"
"It's hard to stop something you enjoy, isn't it?"

What does it feel like to live in the middle of the world?
"You know, you have to be quite strong-willed in a way."
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"So you say, ""Well, you don't have a cigarette unless you have a cup of coffee."""
What does it feel like to live in the middle of the world?
"Of course, that's a double-edged sword because then I found I was drinking more coffee, you know."

So like a domino effect and they'll all be just sitting-
What are some of the things going on in this world?
Mm-hm. What is the difference between the two?
"I don't want to do what the doctor was saying, or insinuating, that I should change my lifestyle."
A bit broad kind of like you have to change everything.
"Yeah. Well, I-I said, well, no. I'm sorry. [coughs] I'm not going to change my lifestyle. I've got to where I am, I'm reasonably happy. Okay, I wish my kids were still around. I wish I wasn't separated."
"""Yeah, right, I hear that, but actually, I don't want to make all these big changes in my life,"" he said."
I don't want to. I don't feel that I need to.
"If you feel like you need to, you can do it."
"I mean, it's you know, what is the reason?"
Mm. is the same time as Mm.
"I can't argue with a medical professional, Mark, because I know nothing."
"The test is the test, and experience is the experience."
"So, I mean, what are some suggestions?"
"I don't know. I think it's up to you where we start, and that's the question I've got in my mind. You've mentioned a couple of things that you've already made some effort, or been conscious of."
Is smoking related to diabetes? How is it related to smoking?
"It can have an impact. So smoking, um, affects your blood system, so it hardens the arteries, and over time, it can have a significant impact on healing wounds. So people with Type II diabetes, often, if they get a cut, or a bruise, or something, it takes a long time to heal."
What is it like to live in the middle of the world?
So we know that smoking and Type II diabetes are linked together-
"If you don't help, don't say anything."
"-isn't a good combination, but it is a combination."
Is it okay to have one without the other?
What is the best place to start if you were gonna make any changes?
What is the best way to reduce sugar in coffee?
Yeah. Hmm. That might be a start.

The rollover effect is something of a rollover effects.
"The domino effect starts to happen, and people start looking at other aspects."
"What is the Domino effect, and how do you explain it?"
"So rather than thinking, ""oh, my God, I have to change all these things. I've got to stop smoking, I've gotta exercise more, I must eat more fruit and vegetables,"" you might start with these small changes, and then-"
How much exercise should I do in a week and how much?
"I'm reluctant to give a prescription for that, because I think it's really up to you. And I think that depends on how things go, as to how much you need to do."
"Right, right. Right, right, right and left."
You mentioned earlier that the doctors were monitoring your blood sugar.
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"If you started doing exercise, you start to have longer blacks, rather than short blacks with lots of sugar, then we're headed in the right direction."
"""So, so, so,"" he said, """
"So it's really up to how things go for you, and you get that feedback. And if that's going in the right direction, you carry on doing and do some more of that."
"If we do that, how do we start?"
I think where you start is where you feel comfortable starting.
"Well, I mean that's something that is not difficult to do."
"Apples for breakfast, for breakfast and for lunch."
"You start off at breakfast and get yourself an apple, a bit-a-bit of apple and so on. Um—"
So what I'm hearing you're saying is that there's-- you're now starting to think of some very useful little starting points.
Is there any way to know if there is any possibility of this happening?
"Not huge changes, but some small things you could do."
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
And I think it's kind of dawning on you that there may be some possibilities here for making some of these changes. Let me ask you this.
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"Where do you see the next set of three, four, five years?"
It is difficult because I don't feel unhealthy now.

"No, no, I don't get that. I get this."
"-till-- You know, I'm not an alcoholic or anything like that."
"So, what is the social side of keeping fit and exercising?"
"So yeah, so to get that balance and maybe that's what I'm actually missing in life, and maybe this is, um -- I mean yes I do get up in the morning sometimes, and I suppose I do feel a bit—"
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"Even after a decent night’s sleep, you know?"
Haven’t quite done that yet-
And you need coffee and I'm getting this coffee and maybe I'm—
"And the coffee helps a little bit, because it perks you up?"
What is the best way to get me going?
"And the sugar in it helps, too, too."
The sugar gives me the boost I suppose. It's fantastic.
"""I'm hearing that your life, your work, your routines are-- sometimes you're driving or you've got to keep awake sometimes and you haven't quite got that buzz or the energy. You need a shot, and then throughout the day you might need just more shots to keep that energy up."

"If I can find some social form of exercise, like squash, I can do it."
And an activity that has got a starting to finish and it's something you do for a slot.

And then there are maybe some social aspects to it as well.
"Yeah, and then—and then and then."
I can see some benefits and some enjoyment that you can see.
"And then give this, say, six months, I don't know what period it would be, and then go back to the GP and say, ""Test me again."""
"""That sounds like a great plan,"" he said."
"And so maybe that would, uh, be a good idea."
"Yeah, sounds like a good idea, sounds good to me."
"I mean, maybe it is an idea. I mean—"
"It has to be something you've decided. You know, just start where you want to start."
"Yeah, like my wife used to. Yeah, like her."
What are some good ideas and good starting points?
What are your thoughts about socializing harder in the future?
What is to lose and what is to gain?
"Is there something to gain, and what do I lose? I don't know until I do it."
"It does make sense, yeah, it makes sense."
I don't mind. I-- it's not a—
There's probably more to gain from making these changes than there is to lose.

What is the best way to answer a question in a conversation?
"- which he says can be managed, and you seem to be insinuating that it can be."
"""Yeah, yeah, yeah,"" he said."
Does this actually mean that this is a blessing?
"So rather than rather than, rather rather than --"
"I think to myself, ""Well, if I am diagnosed with diabetes, I'd just carry on and carry on."""
"""Carrying on,"" he said. ``"
"""I don't know,"" I said. ""I'm sitting in the corner of the bar, and chat and probably get fat."""
"So it's been a bit of a shock, but now you look back on it."
"""Yeah, that's cool,"" he said."
What is the difference between this and the other one?
"""That's really cool,"" he said, smiling."
"-bit of a shake that I needed, you know, just sort of remind me that I might feel okay. I might-- From my perspective, your perspective, you're thinking, ""Well, what is the problem? Everything's fine."""

Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"It comes along to me and we talk a bit about how you felt about that. Initially, it can be quite a bit of a-bit of a shock. It didn't quite fit with how you saw things."
"""True, true, true,"" he said. """
"You're saying that maybe if you look back to where you were before you went to the doctor, things weren't quite that right, maybe things were not as good as you thought they were."
Now that I think about it- now that I know about it.

"""They were,"" he said. ""They were."""
"And what I also hear you saying is that it's possibly more possible, in your mind, that you could make some of these changes, rather than bring broad-brush, you know, huge changes to your lifestyles."
"Yeah, you see—yeah, you can see."
What you're kind of thinking about what those might look like?
Mm. When life comes to a halt-

I'm supposed to learn how to manage diabetes.
"You just- you just saw the doctor and, uh, you know, you sound like you just got blindsided, like you were blindsided."
She mentioned that my legs were having troubles and--
"And so you're really kind of reeling right now from all of that. And you sound a little bit pretty, pretty scared actually."
"Yeah. Well, that's, yeah. It's not just being scared, you know. I don't want that to happen to me."
So it sounds like-so what does it sound like like?
"And it is discouraging, just like discouraging, to say the least."
"So it sounds like, uh, on top of the fact that you've got something you're really scared about having consequences in terms of everything that can happen, what worries you also is all the different things that she told you you're going to need to do to get it under control. Can't imagine doing all those things, so you almost feel like all that bad stuff's gonna happen."
"Yeah. I mean, it looks like a massive task that I'm may not be able to handle. And then, yeah, all this horrible stuff happens to me. And it's a bleak-looking situation and a lot worse."
I want to help you kind of break this up into some-some doable chunks so that we can get your blood sugar down.
"How do I work on one thing right now, given that everything seems so overwhelming?"
"I don't think too much trouble in taking the medicines, especially since I understand my blood sugar is really high."
"""So that's easy to do,"" he said."
"""Yeah, I'm pretty good at taking drugs,"" he said."
Yeah. So it looks like you need to take your medicine every day from the prescription. So that sounds doable.
"Yeah. I think I could probably do that, I think."
What are the other things that need to be worked on over time?
She also mentioned monitoring my blood sugar and all this. And that seemed like a lot of mumbo jambo to me.
Yeah. And that really is to give you feedback about what other things are doing so that it keeps you on task.
"""Oh, okay,"" he said. ""I'm sorry."""
"""How does all this affect your blood sugar?"""
"I like it that we can do it at a step at a time. I mean, that relieves some pressure."

I don't think that's any big problem.

I'm just concerned about how I can lose weight now since work is so busy and the kids take up so much of my time.
"How do you know that weight management plays into weight management? How can I know that there's no need to figure it all out today, especially since things are so busy for you right now."
"OK, that sounds great. What should I do?"
What is the best way to manage weight and health?
"I knew you were gonna say that, but I don't have time in my schedule to go to the gym every day."
"I understand that. I don't have an hour to go to the gym every day either, but one of the great things about physical activity is that any amount can be very helpful. For example, let's think about some activities that you enjoy doing."
"I like to walk, but I don't like to run."
Me too. Walking is a great exercise for me.
"Is walking too mild to lose weight, though?"
"Even just a few minutes of walking is really healthy and worthwhile, and then when you have time to do even more, that's great. Walking is also great because it can be done anywhere, it doesn't need to be at the gym."
"That sounds good. You know what? Come to think of it, I have some time before I have to go back to work. I saw a nice park on the way over here, maybe I can take a short walk after this appointment."
"""That sounds great,"" he said, ""and it does."""
"I used to really love to dance, but I haven't done that in a long time."
"Well, dancing is a great exercise, especially because it is fun."
I know my family would support me if I could just find someplace where I can go dancing.
It's great to hear your family is so supportive. And I bet there's a dance class somewhere around where you live or maybe even a fitness class at the gym.
You know what? I really like to try that.
Is there any way to do some research on this?
"I really would. I'm kind of excited about it, what else you got?"
"Even small steps can go a long way. So, even things like taking the stairs every once in a while or parking just a bit further from the door when you go to a store can be ways to increase movement."
Mm-hmm. Can I do that?
What are some of the strategies that can help?
"Diet, the D word, is the d word of the dictionary."
"""Not necessarily,"" he said. ""What we eat is certainly important for weight and health."""
"Yeah, I like that. Okay, I'll make an appointment and I'll start dancing right away."
"That's great, I'll see you soon."
"""So, um, tell me about the exercise."""
I've been to the gym a couple of times since we spoke last.
What are some of the things that you have in common?
"I have, I have, and I have to."
"""That's fantastic,"" he said. ""That is fantastic."
"And actually, my pants feel a little better. I'm very pleased with it."
What else have you noticed that your pants fit better?
"""I do feel better,"" he said. ""I feel better."""
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"My back, my back—my back—My back."
What do you think of your response to my question?
My back doesn't hurt nearly as much as my back does.
What is it like to live in the middle of the world?
"But it seems like it's, um, but it's still hard. I'd like to go more often or I-I guess that I'm just need to be a little more patient with myself."
What would you do to build up to it?
I guess just sticking with it and not getting sidetracked.
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"Like last week, I didn't get there until like Thursday during the week."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
-so it was- it was a frustrating week for the gym.
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"I was sort of busy with some other things, but, um—"
Mm-hmm. But you made it. You made it one day.
I-I got I-I--I got
What is the difference between zero days and zero days in the world?
"Yeah, and actually I made it again on Saturday too."
"""That's fantastic,"" he said. ""That is fantastic."
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"""Even with this, you know, pretty horrendous schedule going on,"" he said."
"Yeah. It's been a little-little hectic, you know. And, uh-- But, I-I don't like it too much because there's all these younger guys that can lift a lot more weight than me or they can stay on the treadmill longer and it-it's a little discouraging."
What is the best way to get buffed on your skin?
"No, but, um, when I'm not at the gym, and I am my normal rational self, I realize that I'm, you know, way past the age of where I would really even want to do that, let alone want to spend the time it takes. But then I see the buff young guys lifting weights and all that stuff, and then I feel the urge to be buff."
"So, but for right now, it sounds like the pants fit better-"
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
-sounds like it's making you feel good about yourself and—
"It is, it is, and it is worth it."
What are some of the positive things you have noticed about exercise?
"Well, I noticed-- Well, I-I still need to work on my diet a lot. I haven't-- I'd like to say that by working out at the gym, I have, uh, I've modified my diet, but haven't very much. I've gotten a little bit better with that, but I want to do more."
How do you get better at being a good person?
"Um, a little bit less junk food. Um, like at times, when I'm like I feel like, ""Oh, I think I should just go have a candy bar,"" or some worthless thing like that, I'll actually have second thoughts before I do it."
So you're at the second thought part. What do you think would take you over to actually doing it?
It's sort of like the way it works in my mind when I've worked out really hard and I've lost a pound that week-
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"I would say, ""Wow, that would be about two hours on the treadmill."""
"Oh, okay. The payoff just won't be worth that two hours of treadmill versus that double fudgy browny thingy."
Why do people use the word decadent in food?
"'Cause it is decadent, it is lovely."
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
"Yeah, yummy, so-so-yummy."
"So far so good. I-I guess, you know, I'm pretty pleased with how it's going on. I'm really glad we talked that last time 'cause it was the impetus to get me to go the first time in a long, long time."
What is something that you would like to change or maybe that you feel two ways about right now?
"I really want to start working out again. I want to get back in it, have a routine and just be healthy."
Why do you want to make this change in your life?
"I'm sick of feeling the way I do. I feel kinda sluggish. Especially with the winter coming, I think I want more energy."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
I don't like the way my clothes fit.
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"""I don't feel comfortable,"" he said. ""I feel uncomfortable."""
Yeah. So you're not feeling comfortable with the way your clothes fit.
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
What are the reasons why you should make this change?
"I know exercise is always made me feel good. In the past, I felt good about myself, and just in general, exercise, I know, makes me feel happy. I want to be a good example for my kids, I want them to feel like that's part of life-"
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"I want exercise. So, I want to get back in a routine."
What is the best way to heal and feel healthy for yourself?
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"If you did decide to exercise more, how would you go about it?"
"Is there a good time for me to do that, whether it's morning-time or evening-time?"
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
Just to find the time to be able to do what works in our schedule.
"It's that balance of doing something for yourself, but it sounds like you don't want that schedule to affect too much into your family routine."
"Right, yeah. Right, yeah, right, right."
"On a scale from 1 to 10, 1 being not important and 10 being very important, what would you rate yourself on how important it is to start exercising more?"
"If I could say a seven or an eight, how important it is to me."
How come not to be a five or a six?
"""Because I'm really sick of being overweight,"" he said."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"I don't like being unhealthy. It doesn't make me feel good, so I'm motivated to change, it's just getting there."
"So, to summarize, it's important for you to do this."
"""Yeah, yeah, yeah,"" he said."
What do you think of the next step in your life?
"Mm, I'll probably, I don't know, find-- Now, while it's still somewhat okay outside, maybe pick days I'm gonna go for walks or runs, um, maybe look for a gym close to the house so that I know I can go there quickly or maybe that has daycare, I mean, yeah, maybe I'll just start to look for that, and find ways to do it first."
What are some options and leads on how to get it done?
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"I don't know, I'm just having a lot of hard trouble trying to lose weight. Um, right now, it's like no matter how much I try to exercise, run, or whatever, it doesn't matter like nothing else is coming off."
"Is it true that you've hit a plateau in your weight and despite all the things that you're trying to do to increase your activity, it doesn't seem to be working?"
"No, and I don't know what I'm doing wrong because I keep trying the exercise but nothing is happening."
"Right. So you feel like you're spinning your wheels, you're doing more exercising, but it's not showing results on the scale?"
Is there any way to know if you have any questions about this?
How do you feel when you're not feeling so good about yourself?
"And even when I'm coming home, like, I'll go to the gym and then I'm noticing nothing is happening and I'll come home and I try to talk to my mama about it or even my father, and no one even cares about it. Like no one wants to support it anyway."
Why do I feel like I'm doing this all alone?
Is there any way to know if you have any questions about this?
"At home or you think that they'll be supportive, but they're not giving you what you need."
"Not only does my father not want to support me with my weight gain, but at the same time, he feels like I need to gain my weight back."
"""Oh, okay,"" he said. ""I'm sorry."""
So I—so I—I—I mean I—
"Tell me about that, and what you think about it."
"It's as though by losing weight, it's like I'm somehow disconnecting from my family, and he thinks that I'm trying to form myself to fit into like this perfect American picture and I just want to be healthy and I want to have a good body and he doesn't think of it that way."
"Hi, Natalie. I'm Dawn. How can I introduce myself?"
"Hi, Dawn. Nice to meet you and to know you."
"Hi. Nice to meet you, too. Thanks for coming in."
"""Thanks for having me,"" he said. ""I love you."""
Yeah. Tell me a little bit about yourself and your life.
"So I am 28. And I moved out to Arizona about six months ago. Um, I really enjoy spending time with my family and hanging out with friends whenever I can. Work keeps me pretty busy, but I'm really, um, looking to kind of make some changes to my diet and physical activity. I'm not really happy with where my weight is right now, and, uh, so I thought it'd be good to come and talk with you about some of that stuff."
Are you feeling a little dissatisfied with your health?
"I'm starting to notice that my mood is shifting a lot too, which at first, I thought was because it's getting colder outside, but I do also think it may have some relation to my activity, or lack thereof, and also kind of the foods that I'm eating."
How do you feel when you're feeling low energy?
How do I know when I'm more active?
"Yeah. Tell me more about that, those previous times that you have been active."
"Yeah. Um, well, I played sports in college, so that kept me pretty busy, and that was really fun, um, and I just think back now to, as much that I would cram into a 24-hour period, and like, wonder how I did that, but I think that part of it was because I was so active physically, that I just had way more energy throughout the day, mentally and physically to, Um, you know, go to school full-time and still socialize with friends and do all that stuff."
"""You had energy, and you were like the Energizer Bunny, just keep going and going, and going."
"""Yeah, yeah, exactly. Um, like when I get home from work, it takes a lot for me to want to be physically active when I've spent all day staring at a computer and thinking and working."""
"So your days are just as full now that you're working and a career person, but your energy level isn't what it used to be. What is the reason?"
"I do feel like a-an urgency to go, but it just doesn't seem that like the step that's missing is for me to go to gym or I had to do those things because that was, in a sense, my job that was paying for school, but now there's not that same commitment to other people or to scholarship money."
"Right. So in the past, it wasn't up to you whether you had the choice to go physically active or not. Now it is up to the last few years and saying, I wanna do things differently."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
I want to be more physically active than I have ever been.
Is it possible to go run a marathon if you have a better outlook on life?
Great. And you have noticed a mood enhancement effect of exercise.
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
What do you notice about your mood on days when you're physically active?
I'm just happier and more upbeat and I think that even my outlook is more positive.
"Yeah, you feel more accomplished and more irritated by the small stuff."
"Mm-hmm. Yes, exactly."
"""Great. Well, let me see if I've got this all."""
"""Yeah. And then also I'm not totally happy with my weight, and so hoping too that that would have some impact there and-and maybe help me, um, if my activity kind of improves or improves, then my nutrition also, maybe would go along with it and get better."""
How did you start feeling dissatisfied with your body?
"Uh, probably about three, four months ago. Um, yeah, just my clothes started fitting tighter, which wasn't as comfortable, and, um, I'm just not really super happy with my appearance, which has never really been an issue up until now."
It sounds like a vicious cycle and-and maybe the lacking physical activity has made you feel less confident in yourself.
How do you feel about eating something that you don't think is that great?
"Okay. So you had a pretty strong self-confidence, pretty strong body image up until a few months ago and, um, you're hoping to kind of get back to that place where you feel good about yourself."
Mm-hmm. Yeah. How do I know?
What is the best way to say that you are a good guy?
"Well, my-my wife's been getting on me a lot lately about trying to improve my health habits, and I really don't see what the big problem is. I mean, I've been working real hard. Sometimes I can't come home for dinner, so I'm having to go out to eat at Applebee's or something like that, so -- but she seems to have a bigger problem, I really do not see what it is."
"I don't feel like my health is concerning you right now, or anything like that?"
"I-I feel fine, I feel fine. How do I feel?"
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
How do I work out in the hot sun the majority of the day without sweating out any of the bad things I put in my system?
"Have you noticed putting on weight, or anything like that?"
But nothing too -- you know. I'm not blo- I am not bloated or anything like that.
What is the best way to see a doctor?
How long has it been since I've been to the doctor for a physical?
How do you feel when you feel good in your life?
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
What do you think of your wife overreacting to this?
"I'm not overreacting. I know that she loves me and I know she-she wants me to live a long time and be healthy, but just sometimes, especially if you work a hard job, like kinda going out to eat at these places, it makes you feel a little bit better about your situation."
"If you're interested, can I give you some information about obesity or diabetes?"
I'm sure. [unintelligible 00:01:33]
I'm sorry. Good. How can I help you?
So your overall goal is to not give up these things you'd like but to cut back on how much you have-
"Yeah, I guess so. How do I know?"
I'm hearing that this feels really important to you that you'd be way up there on the high end of importance.
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"So, I'm going to ask the question this way, on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is not at all confident and 10 is like, ""I'm very, very confident,"" where would you put yourself?"
"I'm probably-Right now, I'm probably probably-"
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"""I'm going to say a six,"" he said."
"A six is a six, according to the United Nations."
"But I know when I go home and I see the food, it's probably gonna drop to a four."
"All right. So, let's talk about that, um, so we should just assume we're gonna be a four."
What is the difference between right and wrong? Why or why not?
What is the best way to answer a question in a good way?
"""I guess,"" he said. ""I guess."""
Why are you not like a zero or a zero?
"Because I have been wanting to do this for years, like-"
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
I have been conscious of my body ever since I started becoming conscious.
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
"Like ever since I started being a teen like this has always been a goal of mine, like, especially 'cause all my friends play soccer, and like-"
Huh. Uh-huh. What do you mean?
-Hike and are like super stick-thin but really healthy and active.
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
"And so I am just sort of like, well, I'm not."
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
"But I want to be like like stick-thin, but I really want to feel like really healthy and really active."
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
"You know, like be able to look nice, you know."
"All right. All right, all right, then."
"I want to look nice, I wanna look nice."
What should I do to increase confidence in myself?
I don't know- I don't even know-
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"I mean, I know I'm gonna have to keep like telling myself like-"
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
-like this is something that you want that you've wanted-
Huh. Uh-huh. What do you mean?
"For years, it has been known that he had been married."
Huh. Uh-huh. What do you mean?
"Like, you can do it, because like-"
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
I know I can do it. Like I can.
All right. All right. How do I proceed?
I can do anything-can I do anything?
All right. All right. How do I proceed?
"-I know that, but it's hard getting to the point where I-"
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
What should I do if I want to do something?
"All right. Well, if it's okay, just for a moment, let's put the eating pattern off to the side, and let's take a look at some other time in your life that there was something you really wanted to accomplish and you did. And what is it about you?"
"Hi, Liz. Well, thanks for meeting me today."
Is there any way to know if you have any questions?
What is something you would like to change or work towards?
"""I've been thinking about working out lately. I really want to start working out again."""
"And you've been talking about that a lot lately, so I really-"
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"I feel like this is something that you need to do soon because, um, a lot of times, you're just a lot more talk. And then, there's no action. And if you really wanna see results, I think it's something that needs to be done."
Is it just that I'm lazy about my busy schedule?
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"I just need to find the time to do it. And, yes, I might be lacking a little bit of motivation, but I think it is more timing and trying to fit it in."
And that sounds like a lot of excuses to me.
"But I think that part of the problem is that I don't have three to four times a week to do it, or an hour even."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"Time back. I mean, it's not just an hour. It's like two hours, realistically."
"And if you really want to see the results, you have to put the time in. If it's gonna take you two hours, then it's going to take two hours."
"""Oh, um, okay,"" he said."
"""I look forward to talking to you tomorrow. And I'm hoping that you're going to be able to tell me that you went to the gym."""

And, um, I know you were here to see Dr Fields today, and I-I just wanted to let you know that I usually work with people who are similar to- have situations similar to you, and that have gone back home from rehab."
What are some of the best movies of all time?
What is the best way to answer a question in a conversation?
"Yeah. Um, I'm glad I'm there."
What are some of the things you are really glad about?
"I'm glad to see my dog, he's very cute and it just feels good to be home."
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"Yeah. And my garden is coming along, and my neighbors have stuff-- It's-it's good to be home."
"""I know, I-I understand that it was really-- that was your goal."""
"Well, I didn't go to physical therapy this week, and Tai Chi, actually."
I'm wondering if something happened that led you not to go.
"Yeah. Well, I-I had a little semi fall, I didn't fall down, I did not fall down completely but I did-- I guess I still had the wobblies and I was hoping that the physical therapy and the Tai Chi would be- get me further along than it has, and I still don't have the balance."
Mm. So you have been working really hard-
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"You worked hard through this whole thing, you worked really hard to get home."
Is there any way to know if you have any questions about this?
And you've continued to work really hard with both physical therapy and Tai Chi and taking care of your house and doing all those things.
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?

"So I'm-I'm cut back, and I don't know if I should really continue Tai Chi because it's very demanding."
"Yeah, yeah, it's a lot of work."
"It's beautiful and-and-but, um, yeah."
What are some of the things that you are concerned about?
"That I'll fall again, that I will fall again."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"I'll really fall and hurt myself, this way, if I don't move around so much, there's less chance that I will fall."
"Yeah, yeah, yeah. And you don't want to hurt yourself."
Is there any way to know if you are gay or not?
What are your concerns about the fall and how do you feel about it?
"No, I didn't- it was just more scary and it was like a signal that maybe I'm doing too much."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
What are you concerned about if you get hurt or if something happens?
I want to do what I have to do to-to-to stay home.
It feels like the only way to stay safe and not fall is to not do anything to kind of just hunker down.
"Yeah. [laughs] Yes, you have put it very well, hunker down-"
"Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah and yes."
"I want to watch TV and pet my dog. I-I, you know, not to that extreme, but yeah, I think- I think maybe I was going too hard."
Mm-hmm. Mm-Hmm. How is it?
"I'm not sure about Tai Chi anymore. I-I think the physical therapy, I can understand that, but I'm not so sure about the Tai Chi itself."
"So the physical therapy is can- you can still see that it's helping you build your strength, which-"
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
-may have helped you break your fall this time.
"Right, right. Right, right, Right, Right."
Do you remember what Dr. Fields said about Tai Chi in relationship to falls?
"She did. Sh-- Yeah, that's right. She said that they did studies and they found that it was really preventative. I think she's- I forget the percentage, but yeah, she was really enthusiastic and she does it herself."
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
Yeah. So you're feeling a little betrayed like it didn't happen.
"That's a strong word, isn't it?"
"Right, right. Right, right, right and left."
"But, um-But, but, Um-"
"I want to work with you as I know Dr. Fields would, to help you feel as safe as you can in your home."
"Right, right. Right, right, right and left."
-and to keep you there and keep you safe.

"""I think I saw something like that on TV,"" he said."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
Is it true that it works? How does it work?
"It does really work, and it does really well."
"‘Cause you know that they sell so much stuff on TV, it’s like you could-"
"Right, right. Right. Right, right, Right."
"""It's crazy, it's crazy,"" he said."
"I think that there's a couple of different products out there, but it does- it can really help, uh, and-and-and it kind of gives- might give you this sense of security that you have at your fingertips."
Yeah. I guess so. I feel a little scared-
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"-you know, about that happening and- you know,"
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"So, yeah, it's probably a signal to to make some changes."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?

"Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah and yes."
-one step back but now it's to step forward and three steps back.
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"So, um, is there, yeah, like a support somehow?"

"-far away, far away, but not too far away."

"And so one of the things that we also have here, we-we have- we can get some case management services that might be someone who comes in and checks with you at home and helps you figure out some things that might need to be done like you were talking about, give you a little refresher on safety at home."

"""Wow, that's so great,"" he said. """
"But I wasn't able to go, I don't have any one to watch them, so the- that was sort of game over. I just, I had to cancel the interview and this, it's too bad because it was a really, a- actually was a job that would have been good."

"It sounds like the childcare issue has been getting in the way, and so finding something that would work for you would be really helpful."

And then it sounds like you're feeling not so great about your resume and your experience.
What is it that I feel like can lead to the job I want now?
What is it that you want and what is it you don't?
"I want something that is steady and where I can be, you know, even if my kids are in childcare during the day and spending time with them and, um, know you really like to get something where you can make good money and I don't have to worry all the time about money."
"I mean, if you had consistent work, it would change your life, in a lot of ways."
"Yeah. It would be huge, it would be big."
Mm-hmm. It would provide the income that you need and you would worry so much.
Yeah. And it would be nice to know what I'm doing and just have my routine.
Right. So you know where you're going every day.
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"And you know, what's happening for the day, for the week?"

- having someone I trust that can call when I know I've got an interview.

It seems like everyone has a college education and I don't have that on my resume.
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
I get asked about education and training and I get asked –
"Mm-hm, mm-hmm. How is it?"
"- Um, you know, I just, it, as soon as I asked about it, I feel like I'm not good enough-"
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
"Since I don't have that, I can't use it."
"Yeah, so if you had something on your resume that was around education training, maybe a certificate of some kind of a field that you're interested in, you would feel proud of yourself."
"Well, something I could talk about in the interview too. You know, even if I was some type of certification where I could say, you know, with confidence talk about- about that."
Mm-hmm. Okay. What are some of the fields you might be interested in?
"I just don't really know what it's gonna be because I need to have a job now, so I'm not really sure."
Like what's going to be the fastest and fastest?
"That's more important than what I'm interested in, you know, because I'm like, I'm not going back to school for four years right now."
It sounds like if you were going to do something you'd wanna do something really quick like a short certificate.
"Yeah or something that I could get immediate skills that would get me into some kind of a job now, even if it's not my long-term goal or, you know, career."
"Yeah, sort of like a short term or transition into something else."
"Yeah. Great. Yeah. Exactly, exactly."
"But that would be steady and pays well, would it?"
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"Okay, and allow you to buy everything you need to afford."

Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"Hmm. Okay. So whatever and so far it sounds like getting a job is really important right now, and you really need the money and you need to take care of your children. It sounds like you have some ideas as to how you could get to these interviews for one, and then once you're there at the interview, feeling more confident about your skills, then getting some child care certainly sounds very important."
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
As well as doing some sort of certificate or getting some classes in computers?
"""Yeah, that would be great,"" he said."
What is the best way to answer this question and why?

"Yeah. Um, yeah, I guess it started kind of five, six years ago."
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
"It kind of escalated a bit. I've just recently moved out of my parents. So it just made it a bit worse, I think."

What are the other kinds of difficulties you have been experiencing?
"I mean, I'm a photographer. Um, so I kind of feel like it's stopping me from making friends and, you know, like relationships and stuff."
"I mean, your difficulties are getting in the way of doing certain things."
"Yeah. Um, it was kind of easier when I was at home because I was obviously, I mean, my parents, so it's fine, but you know, they would, I'd go to places with, um, or I'd kind of have people there, but more and more, I'm just finding myself just staying in a lot. I mean-- I went like two weeks ago for coffee with my friends and the whole time I was just kind of wanting to go home again."
So you're kind of worried about where this is going to lead.
"Yeah. Um, yeah, yeah. And that's it."
So you said you first noticed anxiety kicking in about five or six years ago.

What was going on around that time and what was happening?
"I guess I had finished school about a year before that. Um, and I mean, I-I've always been a bit shy at school, but it was never ever, uh, like it didn't really affect the things as much as it has been doing the last few years ago, I guess."
What is the most difficult job in your job?
"I guess when it's like I have to kind of be working with other people. Um, I don't like that. It's like when I'm trying to do an event or something where there's a lot of people there, not just photographers, but actual, you know, if I'm like taking places with people that I don’t know, I just kind of find myself saying I want to do them, but just is scary."
So what kind of thoughts go through your head?
"Yeah, I mean, I get really hot and sweaty and I don't feel like everyone's kind of looking at me and thinking that I'm just like really stupid, and I feel like they're all going to be staring and thinking, I just can't do my job."
"""What do you think other people will think?"""

"Yeah. I was doing a job where it was kind of like a Nature issue and I was having to work with a lot of different people. Um, and, um, when they told me about the job, I thought it would be fine. I thought that it was just going to be a few other photographers, but there were actually people and, you know, I was taking photos of people kind of in the trees and stuff like that."

What other thoughts were there in your mind that were going through your head?
"I was just, just stupid and it was just really- just felt really like kind of- like everyone was just going to be staring and just thinking that I-- like- I just felt like everyone were looking at me and just, they could tell."

"If you think about how you looked that day, how'd you think you look?"
"I think it was just very stupid and, like, I think my face was really red. I could feel it flushing and I knew that I'd- I was probably sweating and shaking, like my hands were definitely really shaking. Um, and af-- it was, like definitely really noticeable. Everyone could definitely see."
What did you do about that and how did you hide it?
"I was trying to grip the camera again, just look down, just trying not to do anything weird or-- 'Cause I mean, they could probably tell I was being weird anyway, but hopefully if I just- I just tried really hard to just focus and look down and not trying, like not kind of look at anyone else and just, yeah, just kind of trying get on with it as best as I could, but—"
"So you avoided looking at people, it sounds like you wore black as well in kind of preparation anyway."
"Do you always wear just loads of layers and just because otherwise I-I'll just be really sweaty and like, people would definitely be able to see, so."
How did the story end? How did it end?
I just didn't want to be around them especially after they would've seen me being weird and I just wanted to get home straight away.

"I don't want it mess with my teeth. I know I already have low gums to begin with, like you've been telling me for a while, but I have to flo-floss, which I-"
What is flossing? How do you do it?
"Um, I'm not doing but I don't really wanna wreck my teeth 'cause I didn't really notice any of the chipping."
"""There's nothing yet,"" he said. ``"
I guess I am not paying attention to it.
"Yeah. There's certainly been no problems and you, as you said, have only had it for a short time."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
What would make you decide that this is not right for you?
Do you know if I started to see that it was actually causing a problem?
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"But for now, I mean, I just got and-"
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
It looks pretty cool-and it looks cool too.
"I guess that it does, I guess that I should know."
"Yeah, I kinda-- Yeah, I'm kinda- Yeah."
"Yeah, it looks nice. So, you want to monitor it and-and-and..."

What is the effect of the effect on a person?
"Yeah. I guess if I start to see a problem, I mean, this might not last forever, but my teeth, I'm hoping-"
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
-will kind of stick to the stick [unintelligible 00:02:30]
"Emily, you said it so well it was like it was true."
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"The piercing may not last forever, but your teeth really are-"
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"-hopefully forever. So, okay, well thanks for talking about it."
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"Before I do the exam, you know, I'm always on your case about flossing, so maybe we can take the [inaudible 00:02:46]-"
What's on your mind for the rest of the session?
"The activity piece is the kind of low-hanging fruit that I see. I feel like it's gonna be harder for me to change some of my nutrition habits right out the gate, but if I can get into maybe an activity routine, that could be good to help maybe some of the other changes happen later."
Is physical activity like the easiest change to look at first?
"I think so, I think so. And I think it is true."
What are your motivators for becoming more physically active?
"Yeah, I think just to feeling like physically stronger, like physically more able. Uh, last night I like struggled with the jar of salsa, like opening it. So I think that just stuff like that, um, you know, would be in addition to mood and being more productive and energy and all that stuff. Um, yeah, that that would be a definite end goal for me too. And then really to like that I think my body image or body confidence would improve also."
You're wanting to feel stronger so that you can open jars and other things and also have a better sense of confidence.
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"Great. So on a scale from zero to 10, zero being not at all ready to make a change in the area of physical activity and 10 being let's- let's do this. I'm excited. I am ready. Um, where do you fall on that scale?"
"I'm about an eight, I'd say."
"Okay. So you're feeling fairly motivated, right?"
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
Why did you pick a six instead of a six?
"Well, like I said, I just, I've identified like a lot of things that I think would be good. Um, if I were to be more active and I definitely wanna have that improved mood and energy and feel better about myself, Um, so yeah, all of those things I think are what is driving that rating."
"What are the benefits of being physically active and, um, today you've mentioned energy, mood, strength and body confidence."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
How do I know if I am missing something?
"""I don't think so,"" he said."
"Those are the big ones for you, I think."
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"Fantastic. Well, now we can start looking at how that might look-"
"Mm-hmm, yeah. How do I know?"
What are some of the activities that you might end up choosing?
"""Yeah, that'd be great,"" he said."
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
How can I change something that I've been feeling ambivalent about?
"It's something that's like always on my mind, it's like I gotta just do it. Um, but there's this test that I have to take. It's a big test and I've kind of been putting it off just 'cause I get very anxious. I don't trust in myself that I'm going to do good at it."
How do you deal with anxiety when you're just not feeling confident that you could do it and do it successfully to this exam?
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"And so, it's easier for you not to do it."
"I just avoid it, and put it off."
"What is the scale from 1 to 10, 1 being not confident, 10 being very confident. How confident are you that you can manage your anxiety in regards to this exam?"
What is the range of a four or five?
"So, four or five. How combat, like, not like two or three."
"I mean, because I-I have it set up after like so many years, so I still have a ton of anxiety about it, but I think I'm like kind of making it, maybe that first step. And so that's why I would rate it as like a four or five because I'm making it."
"Yeah. Yeah, and you also mentioned that you made the appointment that you have to take this exam."
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"And before you know it, you've been putting it off for months."
I already kind of put it off after s-scheduling it too. So I'm actually enjoying that because I-I already like the date and everything. So now it's actually coming.
"So, you made this appointment in the past and the anxiety has kind of taken over where you've rescheduled it."
Is there any way to know if you have any questions about this?
How come you feel like you might not reschedule this time around?
"Why do I have to wait three more months to do it? And then I can figure out if I don't pass, I can just study for the next three months. And if I do, then I could have that weight lifted off my shoulders because it's been all a lot of weight on me and I'm just sick of thinking about it."
So that's really encouraging you thinking about how good you'll feel after it's done and taken.
"Yeah. But then I do worry about that negative talk that, you know, when you have anxiety. So then I worry about if I don't pass it, like people are going to ask me how I did and I'm going to have to tell them, it's embarrassing for me. Um, so that makes me anxious."
Yeah. You kind of want to avoid that. Yeah. Have those other feelings that could come up that you don't have.
"Right, right. Right, right, right and left."
How did you feel about something in the past?
Why do people think that I'm not confident in myself?
"So I thought, I don't really like compliments that makes me, um, anxious, but it was a nice feeling because I really didn't trust in myself."
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"""It made me feel good,"" he said."
"So it really built up your self-confidence and it almost not only changed the way you saw yourself, but also how other people saw you and you really, really liked that feeling."
"Yeah, I did. I did, and I did it."
"Yeah. And that must've been really brave for you to do something that seems really daunting, yet you were really successful at it."
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
How do you relate to what you're dealing with now?
"I mean, I think again, like all that anxiety, the same anxiety I had with that I have with those tests."
Mm-hmmmmmm-hm-hm.
Do you know what is the difference between knowing and knowing?
I want to create opportunities to create those moments that you can have that feeling again.
"Right, right, right. Right, right right."
And you just mentioned that you feel really proud of yourself.
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
How do you feel when you can't move?
"I think, considering this test is coming on the way in a few days, I think, for me and just like practicing and just really seeing how I do and if I do well, then my confidence might go up a little bit."
Mm-hmmmmmm-hm-hm.
And maybe just having that faith in myself that I can do it instead of just thinking I can't do it.
How can positive self-talk help you in life?
Yeah. Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"I mean, it sounds like you are still feeling kind of anxious about this test coming up, you've rescheduled it over the past couple years, but you seem more confident to just get it done."
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"Hi, Tanya. How are you doing?"
Thank you very much for your time and your support.
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"I mean, so, um, we're here today to talk just about whatever it is you'd like to talk about."
"How about if we talk about, uh, the problem that I'm really having is, um, getting somebody motivated to move out of my house."
What do you mean by what you're attempting to do?
"I-I offered my home to somebody and, uh, for a transitional period."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"You know, and it seems that it's hard for me to be assertive and say I think the, um, transitional period has come and it's beginning to time to transition."
So that's a really kind thing of you to take someone into your home like that when they need help like that.
What do you think about the ability to say the words?
How can I get to the point of booting them out?
"I don't know, I'm not really sure what I wanna do."
"Mm-hm. So you feel two ways about it. You-you feel like at some level that the time is up for that person to go, and on the other hand, there's a certain amount of security in knowing he's around."
"Yeah, it's kind of like the old sock song saying hit the road Jack, don't you come back no more, no less, no more."
But you're not quite ready to sing that song yet.
"[laughs] Well, first of all I think he would hit the road if I started singing that song because I can sing."
It's scary to be quite honest with you and I appreciate your sense of humor in doing that.
"What is your sense of humor in life and how you view the world and otherwise, you know, I'd be like where's the news."
What really helps you get through things is being able to laugh about it.
"Yeah, yeah I have to laugh, I mean, even comedians say, you know, uh, most of what I've heard about comedians is that they are not always that happy and they use that in a comical way to deal with life, so, yeah."
What is your new career and what is it going to look like?
"Yeah, like this girl Ruth that I know she's got a serious job and she kind of does that on the side."
What is the benefit of having him out of the house?
"""I'm really not sure, I kind of, you know, I'm having a hard time with that. Um."
"Tell me a bit more about that, and how it happened."
"Mm, well, I have to think about it because-"
Do you feel some guilt about your actions in the past?
"Yeah, yeah, maybe some guilt and I, um, uh, I just, you know, [sighs] I go back and forth a little bit."
Huh. Uh-huh. What do you mean?
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
Cause you wanna do the right thing because you're a good person and that's a- that is a really important value to you is that you- that you help other people out.
"I appreciate you saying that I'm a good person, like I feel I am. Um—"
"But you've done your duty, duty is done."
"Yeah. Oops, it's just hard to, er, yeah. I- my j- my job is done and I have to start to realize that I have have to be a little bit more assertive, I think, and more, um, sure of myself."
What have you done in order to get them to Hit the Road?
"Well, um, I've had co-conversations about with him and sometimes not-not so pleasant, but I'm just making, you know, 'cause I happen to sometimes just like hold things in. And then finally I- at-at one point I was very logical about it and then the other day I kind of got not so logical."
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
"What do you think of the movie """"The Martian""""?"""
"So, uh, you were telling me earlier that you have talked to some other people and he has some options about some other places to go to."
"Yeah. That's the good thing that he does, and I mentioned them. I-I-I discussed that with him."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"""And that gives me a relie- a sense of relief,"" he said. ""Like I'm not just saying yeah. You know, go find your own place or, you know, I mean, there are places where he has a safety net to go to and that is something that I feel better about and that makes it easier to discuss and giving them options that he can--"
"So you might have to literally pack his bags and help them get to those places, um."
"Been there, done that. (laughs)"
Are you doing something you have never done before?

Is it possible for me to live in this house for seven years?
"Mm-hmm, Mm-Hmm."
What is it like to live in the middle of the world?
"And it's kind of scary, and it's scary."
"It's scary to have an extra, a huge extra trunk that you have to carry with you."
And he's that extra trunk. And he's just that big trunk.
"Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah and yes."

I have a funny feeling that your plans will prevail.
"I like your way of thinking, girl. I-I-I'll tell him that."
Thanks for talking and playing with our little things here.
Thank you for your time and your kind words and support.

"Right, right. Right, right, right and left."

"""Gotta stay on, yeah,"" he said, smiling."
"Yeah, yeah and then the blood pressure thing. Does that sound about right?"
"Yeah, like I said, it makes me more aware of what's going on and I feel more observant."
How about frequency? How much coffee do you drink?
"Yeah. I have about four cups a day, I think."
OK. Okay. And that feels right to you?

Why don't you fill me in on what's been going on since you last saw me?
I guess everything is fine. I think my caseworker mentioned something about community service that I have to do or something. I don't know.
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
"I'm not sure of that, but I am not sure."
"So she talked to you a little bit about it, but it sounds like you're kind of unsure about the details."
"Yeah, I know that she said I have to get so many hours in, but I don't know."
What do you remember from your conversation with your case manager?
"""I know that I have to get it done by the end of my probation, except that I forgot like how many hours or if I'm supposed to find it or someone else is gonna find it."""
"Okay, gotcha. So, you know, it needs to get done-"
Do you know you have till the end of your probation?
Is there any way to know if you have any questions about this?
-but you're a little fuzzy on details.

So that's something you can work with your case manager on.

What is the best way to answer this question and why?
What other questions do you have about community service?
"I think that's it. I think I was just worried about who was gonna do it for me, but I know I have to, I guess, do it myself. It seems like that's the time I'd have to get done."
"Yup, absolutely, absolutely. And yes, yes."
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
"If you have any more questions, you can always come to me or your case manager and we're here for you to be a support for you."

Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"If you don't want to continue, do you want to stop?"
"""No, it just seems that cutting myself is the only way out."""
So you feel like you've had it up to here.
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"Yeah. You're-you're tired, you're stressed. You feel so sad to the point that you're hurting yourself physically so that you can feel something other than what you're feeling right now."

"I feel like your hands are tied, you feel like you're a burden to mom. She's a single parent. She works a lot. You have all of these problems in your life. And it sounds to me like you are just adding more problems to her."
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"If you're not alive, that solves the issue for her. She will do better."
I-I think so. What do you think?
How is she going to be better off without you in her life?
"Because it won't be a burden to her, she said."
What is the burden of being a burden on others?
"Because she has to pay for my food and my uniforms, we have to have a roof over our heads, she said."
What is the best way to help a girl?
"I try to be a good kid, I tried to go to school. I may not have the best grades, but I'm not failing any classes."

"""That's the right one,"" he said. ``"
-How do you know if it's the right choice?
"""I don't know,"" he said. ""It's just, I'm not sure I can."""
"You're not sure. So you have a lot of on your mind right now. You just opened up to me. You told me that you have been cutting, that you've also been thinking about hurting yourself, killing yourself, not being here. Short-term, the cutting is helping you. You feel like a burden to mom, that stresses you out."
"Thank you, ma 'am, I feel better."
"""Thank you, Ruth. Thank you for coming today."
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
"So, Tommy, I wanted to talk to you because I saw some pictures that are kind of concerning to me of you and some of your friends at a party, and, you know, you're such a good kid. Like, I don't know what you're doing drinking. It's going to ruin your life."
"""It was just the, like a social gathering. It wasn't like I was looking for it, uh, the drinks were there and I-- all my friends were doing it and it was just-- it's-it's not something that I like to do occa- on occasion, but whenever the opportunity presents itself, it's nice to just let loose and have a little bit of fun sometimes."
"But, Tommy, there's so many consequences with drinking. You know, you're not even 21 yet, you could get arrested, you know, have a drunk driving accident. You could mess up your schoolwork. You have such a bright future ahead of you that it just really, really concerns me."
"I-I get what you're going to say, but I-I thought that I had it under control, and I didn't let myself get too far gone. I don't want to be, like, how do I put this? Like, I want it to be in control and I want to make sure that all my friends were okay, so I didn’t let myself drink too much."
"I mean, there's really no such thing as drinking too much. I mean, anything that's drinking when you're underage is drinking too too much, you know."
Yeah. I-I understand what you're saying. And—
How much are you drinking and how much is too much?
"I don't think I'm drinking that much. I mean, it's-it's mainly for social gatherings, like it's nothing that I do, like by myself or whatever. It's just the—"
What is it like every weekend for a family of four?
"I would say every other weekend, I would say, every other weekends."
"Tommy, can't you think of anything better to do?"
Can I be more productive in schoolwork and rather than going out to parties as much and I-I do get where you're coming from?
"Is your friends the problem, like maybe you should just start hanging out with more kids in the youth group and not hang out with those kids you were partying with?"
I don't really put it on myself. I guess it's really been forced on their account. And I've just been following in their footsteps just because it seems like what they're doing is a lot of fun.
"I think you should think about making a big change in your life, right?"
I-I do see that maybe me drinking not as much would possibly better my life to a certain degree. And I think it does make a lot of sense.
"I think you really need to quit, I think you should quit."
"It's just so prevalent in our society and it's just around me, wherever I go and parties and stuff like that. I-I kind of feel like I should just get used to it or at least understand its, uh, effects before I should let it get out of my life entirely."
"I think you're wrong. You know, it really worries me. Anyway, I wish you would quit. If all you're going to do is cut down, that's better than nothing."
Yeah. I-I-I just don't see the problem in it right now and maybe it's because I haven't really had that traumatic experience but I'm—
Do you want to wait for the dramatic experience?
You're-you're right. I don't want to be too far gone before it's too late.
"All right. Well, maybe it's something we can work on together."
That would be a good step forward into a life of possibly being sober and just experiencing the true aspects of life rather than the haziness of alcohol.
"""OK, sounds good,"" he said. ""I'm good."""
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
"""I need to talk to you because as you know, we have a zero-tolerance policy for drugs and alcohol at this school. And as athletic director, it's my job to check in with our student-athletes and make sure everyone's adhering to that rule."
"Right. Actually, I do want to speak to you about something that happened during this past weekend."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
In the moment I felt pressured to do and like conform to what everyone else was doing. So I wouldn't be ostracized.
"Yeah, you know, I get it. Like, we've all been there. Okay. You know, like I was in high school ones too, I got it too. I get that. There's not a ton to do in this town a-and kids drink, but, like, we have these rules."
I understand. How do I understand? How can I understand it?
-and you have to stick by the rules.
"U-I know that it's bad for me. It's bad to my body. It is bad for-for-for being on the team, for being an athlete. It hinders my performance. I don't know. I-I feel that my-my friends pressure me."
"Chris, come on. You're getting peer pressure."
"""Y-you feel very, y-you have to like be unified with the group,"" he said."
"Yeah, but you are one of the leaders."
"Right. And as being one of the leaders, my fellow teammates expect me to be-- I expect them to lead not only in sports but also in social environments. And if that's a social custom in our society, that's social custom."
"Yeah. Well, maybe you should start leading as a non-drinker then."
"I could, but that could also backfire on me. I feel that I could be ridiculed for having a stick up my butt, you know."
Who is going to pick on you when you're a star player?
"I mean, it's just one person against the voice of the mob, I mean."
"All right. Well, yeah. So the issue again is I can't be hearing reports about you drinking. I can’t be hearing that you’re at parties and you can't see pictures on Facebook."

Hm. What is the best way to describe Hm.
Is there any way to know if this is true?
"So, mostly, just hanging out with friends."
"""Pretty much, yeah,"" he said. ""Pretty much."""
Are there places where there are parents around or-
What is the difference between being an adult and being a child?
-or mostly just-just-just with the children?
"Sometimes I'll go to like a close friend's house and feel like I'm close to a family as well. So, we'll all just hang out."
Mm-hmm. What about driving?
"What is drunk driving, and how do you know?"
Do you ever go anywhere after you've had any alcohol?
"I've never been drunk-driven, and I have never been in a car with a drunk driver."
That's something you've made a decision about.
"Yeah, because I know it's extremely dangerous, so."
What do you know about how dangerous it is to drink?
"I mean, I mean, driving under the influence of alcohol can lead to like crashes and accidents and things like that. So I'd rather not be in that situation."
So you're really trying to be safe and make sure that-
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
-you're not putting yourself in the way of yourself-
"""Yeah, definitely,"" he said. ""I'm sure."""
What is it like to stick with that in those situations?

So. What is the difference between this and the others?
"So, it just makes you feel relaxed or relaxed?"
"""Yeah, yeah, relaxed,"" he said, smiling."

"So, I-I wouldn't be able to tell you what happened."
What are some not-so-good things about drinking alcohol?

Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"-and it is something that is considered pretty risky. I wonder what you think about that, just in terms of how it fits into your life."

Uh-huh. So it's kind of something that you're—

What is the role of alcohol in your life?
"Not in my family life, because my parents don't really condone-"
What is the best way to answer this question and why?

-it ties in to the whole belonging thing.
How do you think drinking will fit into your life?
"It will probably have a very small role, if any-"
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"In my life, I have big plans for my future."
Can you expand on that a little bit more?
"I don't think I would be drinking as much or going to parties as much if I'm studying for school, or in college, or trying to get into law school and things like that."

"""Yeah, definitely,"" he said. ""I'm sure."""
How long will it take for you to stop your drinking?
Is there any way to know if this is true or not?
How would that go? How would it go for me?
"I mean, I guess right now I would try to stop in high school, and once I get older, maybe just like socially once in a while but not anything big or anything."
"So you don't feel the need to make any major changes, but you feel like you could make some adjustments that would make it easier or better?"
"Definitely, yeah, that's a good word."
"""How important is it to you to make some adjustments to your drinking habits, on a scale of 1 to 10?"""
"I'm a five or six year old boy, maybe a six."
Why do you say five or six rather than two or three?
"Because, um, it's not something I do not care about at all, but it is not something that is constantly on my mind that I want to change about myself."
"So, it is something you have thought about?"
"Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, definitely."
How confident are you that you could make a change if you wanted to?
"I'm pretty confident that I can, considering I'm not really an alcohol user per se."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"I'm not really into that scene, so, it's not gonna bedifficult for me."
What number do you think you would say to a person?

"Like I said, it is not a big part of my life. So, it's not really that difficult."
"Well, that sounds like you do have sort of a vague plan to make some adjustments in your drinking at some point."
Is there any way to know if you have any questions about this?
What are some of the goals you would like to set for yourself?
"I'm probably going to stop, maybe next party I go to not have a drink at all."
Do you feel confident that you could stop completely?
"Yeah. I mean, I can just tell my friends that my parents are pressuring me."
Huh. Uh-huh. What do you mean?
It's just like outside people that I don't know that well.
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
I could just tell them that I don't feel like having a drink today.
What are the benefits of following through with your goal?
"""I'll have like all my senses there and I'll be aware of everything that's going on,"" he said."
Is there anything else you want to know about the incident?
"I have health concerns, I guess. I know that alcohol is bad for your health."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"""So, that would be one,"" he said."
"So, it sounds like you're actually pretty comfortable with setting a goal of not drinking anymore at least at the next part?"
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
Do you think it would be all right if we met again?
"""Yeah, that would be okay,"" he said."

Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"-having an easier time with achieving your academic and career goals, and not having to deal with some of the consequences that your peers do."
"Right, right. Right, right, right and left."
What is it that you think is important for me to know?
How can I get my friends to stop drinking?
"Oh, that's a great question. So, a lot of times, for kids who are trying to cut back, it's harder if their friends are still drinking, and one of the easiest things is trying to have more activities that don't involve alcohol, but-"
"""Yeah, yeah, yeah,"" he said. """
But that's harder if you're not the one planning.
"""Oh okay,"" he said. ""I'm sorry."""
Is it okay to have anything in your hand without any alcohol mixed into it?
"""Yeah, that's a good idea,"" he said."
How do you prevent people from trying to stuff something else in there?
Is there any way to know if this is true?
"What about in terms of talking to your friends about it, have you thought about how you might approach them?"
What do you mean by mean mean-I mean-
-to stop drinking and stop being a bad person.
-I was just planning on telling them I don't really want to drink anymore. That wasn't me.
Huh. Uh-huh. What do you mean?
So. What is the difference between this and the others?
My friends would be pretty comfortable with that. How do you know?
"Yeah. I mean my closest friends, for sure."
Any other concerns or questions? Anything else I can do?
"No. No, I think I am okay."
I'm going to try and see if we can meet up maybe in a few weeks and see how it's going-
What is the best way to answer this question and why?

Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
All right. Thanks so much for your time.
"""No problem,"" he said, ""no problem."""
"Thank you for coming in, Katie. I'm looking forward to getting to know you, and maybe just wanna start off with just sharing a little bit about you and what brought you in today?"
"""Um, yeah, sure. Um, I guess, well, my doctor referred me to see you. I guess he has some concerns about, um, my pregnancy and- and my baby. So, Um, yeah. Well, I'm doing what I'm told,"" he said."
I'm following through on meeting with you today and you mentioned he has some concerns. Can you tell me a little bit about that?
"""I'm concerned about my alcohol intake,"" he said."
I'm wondering if you have any concerns about this.
Is there any way to know if you are gay or not?
"It's not been an issue for you. Uh, it is an issue to him and not to you at this point."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
What about sharing a little bit about your alcohol intake and what your life is like?
What is the tradition of wine at supper and just to relax with my friends if I go out?

"So it was kind of been a part of your culture for a little bit, and you know, just find alcohol, maybe takes the edge off a little more and-"
"I'm independent and I have friends who have drank during pregnancy, and- and I see articles on Facebook that show that there isn't really a clear link between, you know, abnormalities or, uh, yeah, I just- I just think it's kind of an old wives' tale."
OK. So you don't feel very comfortable with somebody telling you what kind of alcohol you should be drinking and how much alcohol should be consuming.
"""I've looked it up to see, you know, sort of what I can say back to support my argument."""
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
"Yeah, which is that I'm going to do what I wanna do and what I know, right?"
So you know yourself best and you want to be sort of the boss of your body and you don't want somebody else telling you what's okay and what's not okay. And it seems like you're not maybe too concerned right now about your substance use.
"Nope. I never have been, nor will I ever be."
"I'm wondering if that concern is coming from, ""It's been okay. I've received these messages from friends."""
Is there any way to know if you are gay or not?
"""The media has said it's okay to drink during alcohol, and so that concern, um, just sort of, I don't have it and, and maybe the doctor might be wrong."""
"Mm-hmm. I think so, I think."
You're not sure if he is playing things up a little bit there?
"Yeah. I mean, you know, I mean-"
It might be a bit extreme to be extreme to-

"You're not sure if this is, uh, you know, enough-"
"It's the same thing, but it is the same."
How can I convince you that drinking alcohol is dangerous?
"Yeah. It's just a fancy little brochure saying what I already know, I already heard."
"So you feel like, Um, what the doctor's saying and this brochure just kind of feels like, yeah, it's just blowing things up out of proportion a little bit."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
It sounds like you've got some solid information already that alcohol is safe to drink during pregnancy. Tell me about that information that you've explored.
"As I said, Um, well, I've looked up, um, different articles. Um, and I know people who haven't had any problems, so that's about the extent."
"You mentioned you looked up some articles and it sounds like evidence is really important to you. So, Um, those articles, is that something recent? Um, you can tell me about that."
I don't like a bibliography or anything.
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"So I can't really know when those were published. It's just stuff I've found, supporting the way I look at it."
"""So you felt like that the information that you found supports the values that you have of being able to be independent and autonomous, to be able to make your own choice and the information your doctor shared or spoke to you about,"" he said."
"Yeah. Well, it's like all this brochure is saying is that there is no safe amount of drink during pregnancy."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
It's kind of like the “why” that it's like-
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"I never get that information, I never get it."
What is the big deal if you're drinking?
"What kind of issues would that cause, if any, to cause?"

"Well, it's-it's really important to me to have a healthy baby and bring him or her up well and-and, you know, be a good parent."
What does it look like to be a parent?
"Um, not-not like being there at home with them, not being absent, not taking care of them, feeding them, and changing their diaper, which I'm not excited about. Um, you know, kind of the basics."
It is kind of like protecting your baby and-

"Yeah, of course. And of course, that is the point."
"I'm hearing you say that protecting your baby is important to you, but at the same time, um, kind of clashes with some of the information in the brochure."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
What do you think about that? How do you feel about it and why?
"I don't know where these brochures get their information or anything from, like, where's the hard evidence essentially."
I want to see it in black and white. How can I see it?
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
You wanna know that it's the latest and the greatest kind of thing?
"It surprises me that that's based on research from out of 2011, but I must have missed that."
"You know, it feels like you were making some really good decisions about your baby. You've done research and you wanna be able to bring your baby up well and take care of it. And I can see that that's really important to you. I hear you saying that and it kind of feels like this information isn't what you were expecting to hear."
Is there any way to know if this is true?
What would you feel like would be helpful as far as next steps?
"I think that's probably the best thing I can do, like, today."
"""Mm-hmm, that's some really significant steps that you're talking about,"" he said."
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"I want to thank you for exploring this with me today, and I'm wondering if we can kind of continue this conversation again, and talk about those steps, and how it goes with talking to your partner about giving up drinking?"
"I think that's a good idea, and maybe you could help me with, like, ways to approach it because I think that my partner kind of has the same view that I- that I have."
We definitely can cover that again on our next meeting. Thanks for coming to see me.
Yeah. Thank you for your time and your questions.
"Hi, Andrea, thank you for coming in."
Hi. Thank you for your time and your support.
So I don't know how much you know already about my role here and why you're even here. So I thought I'd start by telling you a little bit about myself.

When did you start your career and how did it start?
"I started playing chess about 10 years ago, actually."
What is it like to live in the middle of the world?
"Yeah, I started on the violin first, then I went on, explored a little with the piano, clarinet, finally found the tenor sax, and yeah."
I've always wanted to be good at music.
"I'm just hanging out with my friends or going to the beach, things like that."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"Just kind of everyday sort of stuff, what do you think?"
Is there any way to say yes to this?
Tell me a little about your family and your family history.
"I have one older brother who is about eight and a half years older than me. My parents are my parents, and I have a dog [laughs]."
What kind of dog do you think is cute to have?
Golden Retriever is a golden retriever.

What is it like to have a big boy?
All right. How are things going at school for you?
"They're pretty good. Grades have been pretty all right, still like 3.7 ish."
"Okay, great, so you're doing well. What are your goals after college?"
"I'd like to, you know, graduate high school, hopefully go to a nice Ivy League school."
"All right, all right. All right, All right."
"But I mean, that might not happen. And then I would like to go on and become a doctor. Study psychology and then become a psychiatrist or something."
"""You have some pretty big dreams,"" he said."

"That's great, that's really exciting to think about that-"

Can you tell me a little about why you picked these three?
How do you know if you're in the marching band?
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"I really enjoy being in that team setting of, you know, being with other people and working together toward that one goal."

"""I place great importance in that,"" he said. """
What is the sense of belonging to a group?

And then the respect is really all-encompassing.
Is there any way to know if you have any questions about this?
"Not just authority, but respect yourself, respecting your teammates or your bandmates and other people around you. Okay, that's great."
"""Definitely, that's right,"" he said."
I want to talk to you about something that relates to belonging and your friends. What kinds of things do you like to do when you get together with friends?
"Sometimes we just, you know, go to the movies, go the beach like I had said, or sometimes we just get together at someone's house and play some good board games and hang out."
"Mm-hmm, and is there alcohol involved?"
"Sometimes, sometimes, it happens to me that I can't see."
What are some examples of how alcohol fits into social scene?
It's mostly just for parties or party settings is kind of to get things going and get everything loosened up as they say.
Is there alcohol there when you go to parties?
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
How often do you think you're drinking and why?
"On a not busy month, for instance, I'd say about two weekends out of the month. Two or three."
What is the difference between drinking and not drinking?
"The days that we drink are mostly, like I said, they're parties, so it's more of that whole partying and dancing and, you know, having everyone have fun. And then when we don't, it's a lot more relaxed."
How do you know whether or not alcohol is going to be in the activity?
"Definitely, but not in the way you would expect."
What is the difference between a party and a board game?
"I think of them as-as different, I think, you know, like in playing board games and things that are meant to be relaxing."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
So it's nice to have that kind of breather-
Huh. Uh-huh. What do you mean?
"-versus with a party it's more energetic it's, uh, after it all, very draining."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
But in the moment it is quite fun to dance and have fun.
What are the pros and cons of both sides?
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
What are the things that you like about drinking?
We're a lot more loosened up and relaxed when we drink.
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"It can be bad to drink too much, when it's too much drinking, it can be obviously bad."
What are some of the less good things about drinking?
"It'll make people stupid. [laughs] Yeah, you know, people make dumb decisions and things like that. We usually try to be as safe about it."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"We're not driving, so we're not worried about strangers putting weird things in our drink."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"But, the ideas people can have when they're stupressed can be really stupid."
So you're trying to not engage in really dangerous activities?
Is there any way to know if you are a virgin?
"You're not driving. You're trying to stay with people that you trust, but yet it sounds like there's still some-some things happening from time to time."
Is there any way to know if someone is cheating on you?
Can you tell me a little bit about what happened?
"I don't like it whenever me or one of my friends drink too much and we end up throwing up or things like that, that I don't- that's not fun."
"""Throwing up is never fun,"" he said."
"""It's not,"" he said. ""It is not."""
How often do you think that happens in the world?
"I was the first time I ever drunk and it was- it was a lot, I didn't know what I was doing. I was mixing all kinds of weird things and just kind of taking anything everyone gave me."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
It didn't end well-and that didn’t end well.
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"But after that, I haven't- but I do have friends that still do sometimes, so I will end up like having to take care of them or something and-"
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
It kind of puts a downer on my fun and my fun.
"Uh-huh. Okay. So, on the one side, some of the fun things associated with alcohol are that people are just more relaxed, sorta, um, carefree can kind of let loose a little bit more, on-on the other hand, there's a little more planning involved."
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
And then there can be some other consequences like throwing up when you're stuck with a friend who's drunk too much. Okay. And the other not so good things about alcohol?
"Yeah. People can get a little sloppy, I guess. Like they're all loose, like with people in corners doing things that should be done in private."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
-and that kind of stuff-and the rest of it.
So you're stuck being exposed to things you don't need to see.
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
Is there any way to limit the dangerousness of drinking?
I just- I have an aunt who is an alcoholic. So I-I see like the issues that are involved and I've seen movies and things I know that drunk driving is an issue-
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
I want to be as safe as possible in those terms and be in a setting where like we can let loose but still be safe like in someone's house or sort of my parents will tell me something.
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"And so be where I have fun, and where I can have fun."
"Yeah, it sounds like your value of respect to yourself."
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"On the one hand, the drinking helps with the belonging community to start."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"If there is too much, then it sort of—"
Does it actually defeats the purpose of the purpose?
"It is really wanting to respect yourself and not sort of cross boundaries, not sortof cross lines."
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
How do you think drinking fits in with drinking?
In terms of what? In terms of respect? What is respect?
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
I think that drinking is probably a form of disrespect to my own body because I'm not putting things into it that shouldn't be there.
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
"And then -- but in terms of how it is I am respecting myself, I am- I'm respecting myself by like trying to stay in someone's house and trying to limit my drinking so that I don't get to that blackout like throwing up and everything."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
I try to let loose but still be in control of my behavior so I'm not gonna go somewhere with a person I met-
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"-into I don't know where to go, I don’t know what, and-"
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"-things like that, and things like that that."
So you're sort of looking for that balance?
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
How much can I drink to have some of the positive benefits but not cross over?
What do you come up with at this point?
"I usually, you know, I usually -- Well, I start off like I make sure that I make my own drink so I know what's in it and how much is in it. So in that way I control how much I drink."
"""Mm-hmm. Okay. And do you feel that that's working pretty well for you?"""
"For the most part, it works pretty well because, like I said, people, you know, people come asking me, trying to pressure me, I'll be like, ""No, I'm good. I have- You know, I still have something. I'll get some later."" And I never end up getting anything. Oh, but sometimes they'll say, ""Hey, let's take a shot,"" and everyone's gathered around like the kitchen or something ready to take the shot. And then at that point, I will be like ""Oh, well, maybe I can take one more."" And that's"
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
"-way too much, too much too fast."
"So, it's working well for you, and another portion of the time maybe you would like-"

Mm-hmm. How do I know?

"""I'd like to make sure that I'd, you know, in terms of respecting myself and my body, I would like to drink less,"" he said."
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
"It is nice to let loose and have fun, but I would also like it to be so that I'm not damaging my body, you know."
"Right, right. Right, right, right and left."
Like my liver doesn't work by the time I'm 21.
Mm-hmm. How do I know?

"Uh-huh, so kind of combining you alls-"
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
How important is the goal of cutting back on drinking?
I'd say about like like a six or a seven.
"""Oh, okay,"" he said. ""I'm sorry."""
"I want to work on it, you know, if I get to it, I get around to it. If I don't, you don't."
Why do you say six or seven rather than four?
"""I still think it's important,"" he said."
Huh. Uh-huh. What do you mean?
"It's not- it's not gonna-gonna work out being, you know, drinking every weekend and then trying to wake up early and go to school. It's not a good idea."
"""I can't keep drinking this way and reach the goals that you have for yourself,"" he said."
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
How confident are you that you can cut down if you wanted to?
I think I think I-I think that I-
What scale is one to ten on that same scale?
"If I made the decision I was going to, for sure I think definitely like a 10 I know it'd be going through."
Why do you say 10? What is the difference between 10?
It's just because I know that I can do it. It's making the decision in the first place.
What are the reasons why you would like to cut back?
"And then even if my friends do, like being okay with me not drinking and them doing whatever they want, I'm not going to drink today."
"So sort of, um, trying to plan more activities that don't involve alcohol."

What is the goal you want to work on right now?
I think it's possible. I think it is very feasible.

I think so. I think that is good.
Does that sound like something you would like to do?
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
I really appreciate you spending the time talking to me.
"And it sounds like you have a pretty active social life and a-a lot of friends who you feel probably would be, uh, supportive, even if you cut down on alcohol and that, you know, there's a lot of benefits you see both to your body and your health, um, your school performance, and even some of the social stuff in terms of feeling a sense of belonging without having to deal with some of your gross consequences of drinking too much."
"So yeah, you know, it sounds to me like you have a good plan in place and as long as you're willing and interested in meeting again, I'd be very excited to be able to talk with you about how it's going."
"Yeah, I'd like to do that, if I can."
All right. Great. So I'll-I'll plan to see you then.

Do you feel like drinking is a problem for you?
"Yeah, it's just- it got worse over the last six months."

What do you like to do given the circumstances?
I guess I just wanna stop drinking more and more 'cause I'm doing it now in the weekdays.

"I don't really think I drink that much, but I guess she's worried with how much I'm smoking and drinking right now."
"So you've decided you wanna cut back on smoking a little bit, but you're not really concerned about your drinking."
"It's just a good way to relax, right?"
It's a nice sort of stress relief for stress relief.
"Yeah, exactly. It's kind of like that me time at the end of the day."
"Sort of escape from your hectic schedule, if you like."
"Yeah. You know, I have a two-year-old son, and then I work full-time. And then, I also started going back to school. So, you know, just trying to juggle all that stuff, and so, it's tiring, and I just wanna relax."
How can I juggle being a single mom and going to school?
What is it like to be on your feet all day for work?
"It's pretty exhausting work, but it's worth it, too."
"You know, it's hard trying to please customers all day. And then at the same time, I'm worrying, am I making enough money to support my son?"
"So, you're not only doing really tiring work and going to school but you're also worrying about your finances."
"You know, and then, you know, I have to figure out how I'm going to pay for everything."

Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"Tell me a little bit about your drinking, and what raised concern."
"That's the thing. I don't really understand what raised concern. I mean, I don’t drink that much, you know. I've gone up to maybe two drinks a day max."

"Not much, not much, but not bad."
Will you be interested in hearing about the recommendations?
Is there any way to know if you have any questions?
"Well, so, the recommendation for women is to drink no more than three drinks a day, and to drink more than seven drinks over the course of a week."
"I don't know, i-it just surprises me because, I mean, two drinks a day, that doesn't seem like a problem or risky, you know. And, I have family members who drink a lot more than that per day, and, it's not a problem for them."
"It doesn't seem that abnormal to you, especially when you compare it to your family."
"""I don't know, I-I'm just getting kind of annoyed,"" he said."
"""Yeah, you feel like you need that reward,"" he said."
"Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah and yes."

"So, let me summarize a little bit of what you've told me."
Huh. Uh-huh. What do you mean?

"No. And, I-it's just, it's really hard to take in right now. I mean, yeah. I-I've never thought about it like this."
It seems like it would be quite a hard pattern to change.
"Yeah. I mean, I-it's part of my routine right now, and, you know, I don't want to sacrifice something I enjoy, but I'm trying really hard to be a good mom. I'm-I'm trying to go back to school."
It seems like it is really difficult to change because it's something that is really important to you right now.

"""If there was some way to relieve some of my stress, I think I would feel better, and, you know, maybe at night I wouldn't feel like I had to unwind in the same way."
"If you could tackle some of these stressful issues, what would it be?"
"You know, probably my biggest problem is just childcare. You know, my mom normally watches my son, but she's been kind of backing out lately. And so, I'm worrying, am I going to have to call into work today, am-am I gonna have to miss class?"
"""Having more reliable childcare could make a big difference,"" he said."
"""Yeah, definitely,"" he said. ""I'm sure."""
It sounds like your mom has been an option in the past but perhaps not so much anymore.
"I mean she watches him so much. I think she's just probably getting stressed out too. And I feel bad because, you know, it's not her son, so i-it shouldn't be her problem, but I need something that I can rely on better."

I have a harder time going to sleep on nights when I don't drink.
"""Well, you're not alone, a lot of people think that drinking helps them sleep better, and in reality, drinking might make you fall asleep faster, but it has what's called this rebound effect."""

"""I didn't think I was that bad,"" he said."
Is it helpful to look at this and give some perspective?
"I mean, this is all news to me. I mean, I don't want to do anything to put myself at risk and I've always thought of myself as a pretty healthy guy. I guess I should put myself right in the middle of the five."
What kept you from just giving it a one or two?
"So, that's-that's why I'm coming in, because I need to be able to get my sleep back on track, but I also don't think of myself as a hazardous drinker, and I'm certainly not an alcoholic."
"Mm-hmm. Okay. Well, that's a good place to start."
Is there any way to know if you have any questions about this?
"So, what are you willing to think about doing right now?"
I think the natural thing would be to cut back a little on drinking.
"Mm-hmm. So, what does that look like for you?"
Is it possible to drink more than three or four beers a week?
Why do people write their goals in black and white?
I have no more than 18 drinks a week.
"That's an improvement. So you're headed in the right direction. I do wanna let you know that with 18 drinks a week, you're still falling below this low-level risk category, and that it would be my recommendation that at some point you fall below this 14 or less a week."
What is your opinion of the movie and how it was made?
I'm hoping that in your appointment next month we can touch base on this and see how it's going.
Is there any way to know if you have any questions?
I'm sorry. Good. How can I help you?
"In summary, the Minnesota State Mankato Security Report states that you were stopped on stadium road last Friday, cited for driving under the influence and taken to detox."
"""I guess that sound- that sounds right. I mean, I was drunk and it happened like a week ago. I just, I drove over to my friend's house, um, just to go watch the game and, you know, we're having a couple beers and next thing I know the Vikings are kind of losing pretty big. So we drank a little bit more than usual."""
"When your roommate couldn't give you a ride home, you decided to drive yourself home."
"That's-that's exactly how it happened. I mean, I'm a normal college kid. I like to drink and hang out with my buddies."
"I understand that your intention was to have a good time while watching the game with your friends, but you didn't think about what could go wrong when you drank alcohol underage because you were at your friend's house and not a big party and you made an effort to be safe by finding a ride home."
"I tried to be safe. I mean, I tried to call her roommate, but I don't know, I'm getting in trouble anyway."
"Dylan, what brought you here today and what do you think the problem is?"
"I wanna say I have a drinking problem. I think I'd probably have more of a, like getting caught problem."
How do you attribute your current situation to bad luck?
I guess I have more problems with police and school and I really don't have like the time or the money for any of that.
How important is it to avoid future problems with police or school?
"""It's, I guess, super important, because just going to detox alone was awful, the experience-- I don't want to do that again. And my dad said if I get suspended from school, I have to go to my uncle's farm in Iowa and that would just kill my social life."""
How do you prevent going to detox again and getting suspended?
Is there any easy way to drink too much?
How confident are you that you will be able to follow through with your plan with 10 being very confident?
"""I guess I would say like, I don't know, like over halfway,"" he said."
How can I move from six to a seven?
"I could probably, but I don't know. I-I guess, well, the big thing would be like kind of where I drink like if I'm only like in my apartment so thenI'm not risking myself to drive or like I- if I go out to a party waiting till, like, I'm 21 to drink. Um, maybe find stuff to do that doesn't revolve around drinking. I'm guessing like a town this size there's got to be more than just drink."
What is the best way to make changes in your life?
"I mean, I guess the big one would be like I won't be hungover all the time like I would make it to my 8:00 AMs. I mean, well, even-even when I make it at my 8-ams, I sleep like I wake up and I'm like, ""Oh my god what's going on?"""
What are your beliefs and values that influenced your decision-making?
"I mean education is really important to me and-and also my family. My parents are always talking about it and I really wanna be an international journalist, to be on the news like, I mean, I have the face for it, um. So I guess if I reprioritize what I need to do I and I won't drink so much. I probably wouldn't be disappointing my parents."
Your sanction will involve being placed on university disciplinary probation and attending an alcohol education seminar that will cost $150.
"All right, all right, when is the seminar?"
Would you like to answer some questions and kind of do a self-evaluation about how you feel about alcohol and the contraception?
Is there any way to know if you have any questions?
Which number best reflects how important it is to drink the drink?
I would say that an eight is an eight.
How confident are you that you can drink below risk levels?
I would say that a four is a four.
The amount of four is the same as the amount of six
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
What makes you confident that you can drink below risk levels?
Is it because you've told me I'm at risk and I have alcoholism in my family and I really don't want to go down that path.
So that gives you a good reason not to drink?
"""Well, I have a group of friends that doesn't drink that I hang out with,"" he said. ""I think that helps me."
What is the best support group to have fun and still drink below risk levels?
Is there any way to know if you are gay or not?
Is there anything else you would like to ask me?
Is there any way to know if this is true?
What is the importance of using birth control every time you have sex?
I would say that an eight is an eight.
How confident are you that you can use birth control?
"If every time, every time,- and every time"
"Every time, every time, and every time it happens."
"-probably a six or a six, probably a six."
"""Correctly as it is prescribed,"" he said."
"Probably a six or a six, depending on the age of the child."
Is there any way to be a six or a two or three?
I'm six because I think if I drink less I'll be more reliable with using birth control. I tend to not use it when I'm drinking too much and I don't really care too much.
"""So it's kind of linked to your drinking, the fact that, um, that you can take care of that drinking,"" he said."
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
The birth control issue and this importance comes down as your reason for not being down here.
Is there any way to know if you have any questions about this?
Is there any way to develop a plan around alcohol use?
What should I do before I leave for the trip?
Is there any way to know if you have any questions about this?
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
"If you need more information, we can get that for you."
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
Do you mind if I look at the questionnaire you filled out before the visit?
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
My role is to share information and learn from what they want to learn. Does that make sense?
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
How many times have you used alcohol in the last year?
Yeah. Somewhere around eight days. I'm not sure how long.
What is the best way to describe your drink?
"I really only drink at parties, I don't drink at home or anything."
What kind of alcohol do you drink in parties?
The drinks at parties are usually like vodka or orange juice or gin and tonics.
How much do you usually drink at a party?
What do you mean by the whole time I am there?
Is there any way to know if you have any questions about this?
"I had probably four or five drinks, I'm not sure."
"Speaker 1: Okay. You checked the box here that drinking helps you feel relaxed, feel better about yourself and fit in?"
"""Yeah. It makes me feel relaxed,"" he said."
And you also checked that sometimes you forget things when you drink too much.
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
What kind of things do you forget and what are some of them?
I forget how many drinks I have had like when a friend asks me or I forget whose house I'm at.
"Sometimes you forget where you're at, sometimes you forget that you are at."
"Right, right. Right, right, right and left."
What is the safest level of drinking for teenagers?
"I was drinking the last time I had sex. Um, the guy had been drinking too, and we didn't use condoms."
Do you remember giving consent when you have sex?
Yeah. We've had sex before and we have used a condom before.
What do you think of drinking alcohol without condom?
"""We just didn't stop to put one on. We weren't thinking that way,"" he said."
How does drinking change how you think in that moment?
I would have definitely told him to put on a condom if I was sober.
"If people forget where they are or how many drinks they had, that's a sign of heavy drinking. And when people keep drinking despite experiencing negative consequences, that can be a symptom of what we call alcohol use disorder."
That's not me. I don't need help from anyone.
What do you like about drinking alcohol and why?
"I like drinking when my friends are drinking too. Um, I laugh more. It's just fun."
What are some of the things you do not like about drinking?
I don't like forgetting where I am at sometimes.
What is the best thing you can do to improve your health?
"I don't want any STDs, I just don't like them."
"So, on one hand you like the feeling of being relaxed and having fun when you're drinking and on the other hand you don't like forgetting where you are or forgetting how many drinks you've had and you don’t like putting yourself at risk of STDs?"
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
What do you think about what you like and not like about your drinking?
I don't want to drink too much again.
"How ready are you to not drink too much? If you asked me to pick a number on a scale of 0 to 10, and 10 being totally ready, what number would you pick?"
What is the difference between a nine and a nine?
Why do you choose a high number like nine rather than a lower number like a six or a seven?
I don't want STDs and I don't like wondering whether I have one or not.
What is the best way to achieve your goal?
I wanna count my drinks so I don't have more than two and I want to stop drinking if I start feeling drunk.
What is the best way to achieve your goal?
Why do people think that I drink too much?
How about unprotected sex? It sounds like you don't want to experience it again.
How do I make him promise that we never use a condom and that we don't have sex drunk?
How can I change my drinking habits and keep from drinking more than two drinks at parties? I would like to share how it works for you. What do you think?
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
Great. Thanks for talking with me. I look forward to seeing you again soon.
"So Chris, I wanted to talk to you a little bit about how partying and alcohol fits in your life right now, and I really value you as a team player. And as Athletic Director, one of my jobs is to keep tabs on the players and make sure everybody is performing at their best. And something came up this weekend. I've been hearing some chatter about a big party that went down and understand you were there."
"I'm a honor student and my parents keep me very, like K-kept down out of social life."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"And, um, about a month ago, my friends invited me to a party. And they used the fact that, Oh, I'm always doing my homework, I am always studying that to allow me to go to the party."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"It was a- it was a unique experience, I guess you can say. And I don't know, I-it was fun, at least in the moment. So, I kept doing it. Then this past weekend, instead of studying for an exam, I asked my mom to let me go to another party. And she, kind of, knew what I was doing."
"So, here you are, you're an honors student. You're a star athlete. You've been doing everything you've been told for all these years, and maybe last month sometime, you started getting more involved in the party scene."
"Right, right. Right, right, right and left."
"It was fun at first, but now you're already noticing some consequences."
I've been noticing that I've been more lethargic and apathetic toward schoolwork.
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"I haven't really -- I kind of just sit in class like my mind is elsewhere, especially on weekends, where instead of studying, I caught up with my friends, trying to find where we can get alcohol based on their age and stuff like that."
"It's really changed your focus, what do you like about drinking?"
"It-I don't know. It-It's because I'm a very reserved person, for the most part, not when I'm dealing with sports or like-- you know, like a social environment. I tend to keep to myself because I am very self-conscious, I would say. And when I drink, I feel like it relaxes me."
"So, it helps you relax, feel more relaxed."
What do you think of this? How do you feel about it?
What are some of the not so good things about alcohol that your mom got mad at you for?
"It's kind of funny, but kind of weird."
What are some other things that can be added to the list?
"Just different groups, friends or groups, girlfriends like different people that I'm hanging out with because certain people are associated with that type of scene."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"So, that-that-that is also changed."
"So, your-your friends that you were hanging out with, there is a little tension there now."
A little bit because not all of them are into that.
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"Since then, I have been hanging out more with them, getting to know them. But I can also see that I'm just living life, I guess. But that's also not fair to them that I am not there for them as much as I was before."
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
"As long as they are there for me, you know."
"What do you think of the changes that you've noticed in your life that are affecting your friendships, it's affecting your studying, it is affecting your relationship with your mom?"
"I feel like I should st-stop. I mean, like, I'm not-not unrealistic. I understand situations like this will happen."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"Is it up to me to take it so far, where I can't remember the night before, if I'm puking?"
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"-that's not worth it, either. And I have to slowly build back my trust with my mother because that was that was a big blow. It's little so I guess may seem to other people."
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"But to me, it's a big thing, to me."
"""Your mom is really important to you,"" your mother said."
"Of course, of course. And of course of course"
How she feels about you is important to her.
What do you think of this? How do you feel about it?
How important is it in your life to make an adjustment in your drinking?
I feel a lot at this point because I feel that's a big factor in gaining back my trust with my mother.
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
And also getting back on top of my school work again.
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
I feel that there is a future in that.
How confident are you that you can change your drinking habits?
"I'm pretty confident, especially in myself, I think."
"O-on a scale of 1 to 10, where one is not at all 10 is completely what number would you give to someone?"
"Probably like an 8 or 9, probably like a 9 or 10."
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
"""I feel like there can't be a ten in life, like there's too many factors but I feel like I'm determined to."""
Why did you say nine rather than six or seven?
I don't know I feel deter-determined to-to make sure this happens because I don't like how I felt after I betrayed my mother.
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"I don't want to drink to the point where that happens, like all the fun that I have and prior to that it's not worth drinking."
What do you think is realistic goal for you?
"I want to make sure I have my studies. Well first, try to get back my trust with mother-"
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"-then just focus on my studies. Then if I have time for leisure time, I'll go party with my friends and just be as a party with them doesn't mean I have to drink. And doing one cup is not going to do anything to my life either. But I prefer not to do that. I prefer just make sure."
So your goal is kind of to do not drink at all or if you are at a party a maximum of one at the very most.
Just so I take part in social convention but it's not. Hey guys.
"I appreciate you talking about this. I know it seems like something that's been on your mind as it is and you know, like I said I really care about you as a student and an athlete and want what's best for you. So I'm glad we were able to talk about it."
And thank you for listening me listening to me. It means a lot.
It's my pleasure. It's part of my job and it's probably like this so I'm going to hurry up and get changed for practice.
Hi Nina. I'm looking forward to getting to know you and hearing a little bit about you and what brought you here today.
I had to come because I've been a little irresponsible with this pregnancy. Yeah.
"""He's thinking you were a little irresponsible,"" he said."
"Yeah. Um, he said that I was drinking too much with it, but I-I haven't been a lot, but he said it would screw things up."
And you are feeling kind of concerned about that.
"I don't want to screw anything up with this baby, but I'm just- I'm scared I already did."
"You're concerned about the consequences, and you really care about your baby and you want to give your baby the best start you can."
Mm-hmm. Yeah. How do I know?
And you're wondering a little bit about this time we're going to spend together.
"Did he really tell me what to expect. He just said, ""Go- go see her as well."""
So here you are today and you have been drinking alcohol throughout your pregnancy.
I didn't find out I was pregnant until probably two-ish months in-between.
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
"-and I had already been drinking then. Um, I've been really trying not to, but, you know, weekends come around, and, like, all my friends are kind of partying and stuff, and it's been hard to break that habit."
There's this external pressure coming from the people you care about to stay in the scene.
"""I think if I talk to them, it would be fine, but it's weird, right? Like I'm the only one of my friends that's, like, taking this step and having a kid, and they don't really know how to handle it."
"It feels like you're between two worlds. In one world you're preparing to be a mother and bring a baby into this world, and this other world is the world you've been in for a while where you're kind of having a good time and-"
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
Drinking and your friends are-drinking and you are
"Yeah, like, I'm- I'm still in my 20s, and-and for everyone else it's like, ""Okay, it's party time,"" and now I have to break out of that."
What do you feel like about this party-time world?
"There's part of me that still wants to live that out because I'm not going to have another chance, like once this kid comes it's going to be over. I know I'm gonna have to change."
"It's time to go to the mom world, for you, because you're feeling like things are going to change, but right now, while you're pregnant, you're thinking, ""I can kind of hang out in both worlds a little bit,"" but part of you may be thinking that's not the case."
"Yeah. I'm also feeling like it's too late, I already screwed it up."
"So, you've got a lot of concerns about what's happened to you up until this point, as far as your drinking. What do you know about alcohol?"
"I know they say not to but I thought because my friends didn't really care, I thought, ""Okay. Like maybe it doesn't matter. Maybe it's just what they tell you."" Just like drinking is bad."
"So you were thinking that your friends weren't pressuring you to stop drinking, that it must be okay."
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
And then there's this other part of you that was thinking that it's not okay.
"Yeah, like I should have trusted my gut."
"So, your gut is telling you what? Tell me."
It's telling me that what I'm doing is wrong and it's probably hurting my kid and that I'm gonna really regret it once I actually get my kid.
Is there any way to move forward from here?
I'm definitely it's not-- I think I could probably do it.
"So, you kind of have this dual identity going on. I wanna be that person, yet, that person-"
"And so many people, when they have kids, they just disappear from their friends. And I don't wanna be that person that just has a kid and they're completely different."
"Mm. So, embraces this life of the picket fence and the little house and having the baby in this-"
"Yeah, suburbs. Yeah, suburbs and suburbs, yeah."
"So you don't wanna be that woman that's just sort of living in this house with the baby carriage, and at the same time, that world is kind of saying it's behind you."
"I mean, I don't wanna lose friends because of this. Like, I do not wanna put pressure on them to change because they're, I mean, good people. They're just—"
"You care about them, you love them, and you care."
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"It's just the scene that they're still in because their life maybe hasn't taken that change that your life has made. And so now you're here and you're not sure. You want the baby, but you are not sure about the suburbs and the picket fence thing. You're not really sure—"
I don't want that. I don’t want it.
"If you don't want that, don't do it."
Is there any way to know if you are gay or not?
I want this baby. How can I get it for myself?
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
I wanna take care of my baby as the baby's growing.
"Like, I wanna be responsible for this thing."
"""You don't wanna let your baby down,"" he said."
Is there any way to know if you are gay or not?
"I'm thinking, ""I don't have a choice. I've got to look this way."" What does it feel like to let go of the past?"
"Is there any way to make a choice, I feel like I made some bad choices with this."
"Nina, what is your hope for the future?"
"But I kept the kid because I wanted-- it was almost like that push, that sign for me to move forward and become like an adult because it's scary, right?"
"It was almost kind of like a sign for you that the baby is giving you a kind of a new chance at life, or give you a plan B,"" and you guys get to decide what plan B is gonna look like."
"Yeah, I just guess it's easier said than done. Like, it's like, great, I can make all these changes and I can be a completely new person, but it's, like, at the end of the day, I'm still just who I am."
"While this baby's growing in you and you think of all the opportunities that could come out of this, there's a part of you that says, ""I'm still that same girl that was drinking and partying and not living the life you wanted to live."""
"You know, you can't just one day flick a switch and become a new person."
"While this baby feels like this is your second chance, you're wondering, ""Do I deserve that second chance?"" And then this other part of you says, ""Why not?"""
"Yeah, I guess that voice is just a little more stifled than the other."
The baby is a constant reminder that there's this new life ahead.
"Yeah, it's going to be very different when it actually comes."
"When you think about it, you know, embracing this new life, and taking that different path, turning away from path A and moving into path B, how confident are you that you can take path B and be successful in raising this baby?"
I think I'm gonna have to be successful. I don't really have any other choice. I have to take that path.
What makes you feel like you have to take that path?
Is it gonna be all screwed up if I don't do it for my kid?
Do you have the confidence to make this life a reality?
"You know, like, maybe actually talking to my friends and saying like- or maybe them actually being able to see this kid and go, ""Of course, of course, your choice makes sense. You--"""
So you're thinking that when your friends see you with the baby in your arms that they too will see that there's a different path for them too?
Or at least they will feel less pressure to be who they want me to be.
"Mm, kind of feel like you're being pulled between two worlds."
"""A little bit,"" he said, ""a little bit."""
What do you think of the people in your circle supporting you in moving toward path B?
"I would like to meet other people who are maybe, you know, having kids too so that I can see, like how it's done 'cause like, I only have a younger brother who's like not-not even close to that. So I don't really have anyone in my life that I know that's had kids recently."
"And your parents are a support for you and support you from giving up drinking, the alcohol use, that's something that they would support-"
Do you think people realize that I'm doing it?
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
"If they found out, they would be really pissed."
"""That would be a concern for them as well as for you,"" he said."
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
Is that something that you would be open to meeting with me again?
What is the scariest thing you have ever told your parents?
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"And having to talk to those friends, like right now, I don't want to do that. It puts them in a weird place."
It kind of feels like you're climbing Mount Everest.
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"If you don't have equipment, you don’t have equipment."
It feels like I have to lec- I don't want to have to lecture them and I do not want it to be like a lecture.
"""You're concerned that they're gonna treat you like a child,"" he said."
What is the difference between my parents and my friends?
"""Oh, oh, you're talking about your friends,"" he said."
"Yeah, lecture my-- Yeah, lecture your-- Yeah."
If they're gonna kind of be like children and you're gonna be like the parent saying-
"""I don't wanna be like that,"" he said."
"""You just wanna be like peers talking,"" he said."
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"And you want them to support you and support you, too."
"I want to stay friends with them, but I don't want them to just-"
"You don't wanna lose your support group, yeah. You just wanna them to support you in being healthy, while helping them raise the babe, and so we're just taking path B. You don't want to lose them, just maybe the lifestyle it sounds like."
What is the balance between the paths and the worlds if there's a balance between that?
Mm. You kind of want the best of both worlds.
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"I want the friends and the relationship that I get from my friends, but at the same time, I don't want the party scene that goes with that."
"Yeah, like I know I can't cut off my friends."
And I-I really just wanna support you in being able to make those choices and have those conversations.
Is it already too late to do this now?
"You're concerned about the health of your baby. I just would love to share with you, Nina, that every day without alcohol is a good day for your baby, and you know, starting today to have zero alcohol and I'm wondering if that's the sort of thing you'd be open to as no more alcohol at this point."
"Mm-hmm, I have to do something."
It sounds like this is really important to you and you want to make this happen.
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
Is there anything I can do to support you before we wrap up?
I don't think so. I think just knowing that it is not too late already is enough kick in the pants to get started.
"""I kind of got a reality check today,"" he said."
"""A little bit,"" he said, ""a little bit."""
"You did really well talking with me today, and I thank you for just sharing your heart."
"Hi, are you Katie, how can I know you?"
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"Hi, my name is Beth. I'm the nurse who works with the nurse practitioner Mrs. Smith that you just saw. Do you have a moment to talk?"
"What is this about, and what is it?"
"I know you were here to get a prescription for birth control but while you were waiting for Mrs. Smith, you filled out a healthy habits questionnaire-"
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
Would it be okay if I asked you some questions about marijuana use?
Is there any way to know if you have any questions?
"I notice you smoke marijuana regularly, and I wanted to ask you more about that."
"You know they decriminalized it in Virginia, it's not a big deal, I'm not in trouble, am I?"
Can you tell me about how you use it?
"It's not a big deal, it's just like a couple times a week to relax."
Marijuana is really useful in helping you relax?
Is there a lot going on at the moment?
"""I'm a very successful student and have a lot of responsibilities and it's really adding to your stress."
"The truth is I'm the first in my family to go to college so I don't know, I guess, I'm a bit over my head."
Mm. You've been very successful academically and the transition to college was hard for you.
What is the best way to calm your nerves?
"I promise you that you're not in trouble, I wanna help."
What are the positives and negatives of pot and why?
"I'm just so much more sophisticated than these kids, I feel like I'm fitting in."
What is it that makes you feel more at home in a group?
"I don't know if I feel more accepted, more like I'm trying to fit in."
How is it working for you to fit into the world?
I'm not sure if this is true or not.
Mm. So smoking pot to try to fit in more doesn't seem to make you feel more comfortable with your friends.
What is it like to live in the middle of the world?
What are the downsides of smoking pot? Why or why not?
"I don't know. I- It helps me relax but I'm nervous I'll get caught. Um, my parents would kill me if they knew that I smoked."
How can I feel more socially comfortable with my peers if I'm smoking pot?
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
What are some of the downsides of smoking pot?
"I don't have the money for it. I just usually bum it off to my roommate, her parents give her a lot of money but I don't know, it's kind of embarrassing to have to do that."
So smoking pot also reminds you of your financial situation and you don't have extra money to spend on things?
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"It sounds like smoking pot is helping you relax, but it's also causing you a lot of stress because you're trying to use it to fit in and that's not helping, you're worried about getting caught, you are worried about family disapproval. What do you think?"
Why does it sound like a very bad habit?
Would it be okay if you made a suggestion?
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
Have you ever talked to a counselor about anxiety?
I don't do that kind of thing in my family.
Can you tell me more about me and how I can help?
It's just not done. I don't know. It's something for crazy people and we don't have the money for it.
So the idea of counseling is for crazy people only and it's looked down upon and cost would cause a problem too?
Yeah. I just don't see it happening to me.
"Katie, we know that many kids come to college and have a lot of stress and deal with anxiety. We've also found that when they talk to our counselors and learn specific skills about dealing with anxiety, they do much better. Um, and it's been really successful for a lot."
I don't know. How do I know?
What is the reason for being hesitant in your interview?
I don't have the money for it so I can't pay for it and my parents don't approve.
"Well, the cost is free and the counseling services we provide, we are legally obligated to protect your privacy, but we can't tell your parents. There are some exceptions to that privacy rule, including, uh, mostly if we're concerned about your safety."
What is suicidal? What is it like for someone to be suicidal?

"""I guess I'll think about it,"" he said."
"""If you're walking out now, I can walk out with you and just take you around our counseling center. I can even introduce you to one of the counselors,"" he said."

"""I just wanted to show you where it is and let- make sure you know about our resources here at the college,"" he said."
"I agree. Okay, sure. I agree, let's go."
I just feel helpless about this whole thing. How can I deal with it?
"""You're hopeless about what's going on,"" he said."
Mm. I feel helpless about this whole thing.
You seem to be at a loss of where to go from here.
"No one wants to help me, no one is helping me."
I feel like people aren't willing to help me.
"No one wants to help me, no one is helping me."
You feel alone. How can I help you feel alone?
Mm-hmm. I should have done it.
You realize it was something you shouldn't have done.
Mm-hmm. I should have done it.

"""This is not what I want for my life,"" he said."
"This is not what you've envisioned, this is not how you have envisioned it."
"""This is not what I want for my life,"" he said."
"""You're willing to take steps to improve that,"" he said."
Mm-hmm. I really want to get out of the program.
What do you mean you don't want to be here?
I really want to get out of the program.
"""You seem motivated to follow the rules,"" he said."
Mm-hmm. I still crave smoking.
"""It's something that's always on your mind,"" he said."
"I still crave smoking, even though I have stopped."
"It takes a lot of strength to not smoke, even though you're still craving."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"Well, welcome, Ricky, welcome to the show."
Thank you very much for your time and your support.

"And, like I said, I still live in Palmy and, as you can imagine, it's sort of a bit different down there."
"I know Family Bar, yes. How do I know it?"
"Yeah. It's that sort of- that sorta scene, that kind of, um, gay scene, I guess. And, like, it's not something I'd really thought about before and- But then I just hung out there and just met these people that were sort of like you don't really get there much Palmy. Well, I mean I suppose you do, but they're not-- You know, in Auckland you can just be it out in the open, you know, and I suppose in Palmy you can't as easily. Um, so just to arrive and see that and sort of meet"

Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"Um, and it was like quite a lot of money that la-last year. So it wasn't such a problem then. And I suppose I sort of blew that money a little bit. Um, so now I don't have that acting income coming in as frequently and I'm working in a cafe like a sort of part-time and it's not bringing in as much. So now it's sort of like, and sometimes I need to borrow a bit of money or sorta need a little help with the rent sometimes."

I don't know if it's having an effect.

"""They're important,"" he said. ""They are important."""
"Yeah. Yeah, and I mean part of it, yeah. Part of it I just wonder 'cause, you know, a lot of those friends that set me down are obviously the ones that are not part of that scene. I mean there were a couple there that are, but mostly they were the ones who sort of have always sorta been a bit judgy."
"You have to take a stupid amount to do any kind of like, or to die or to end up in a hospital."
Yum. What is the difference between Y and Y?
It's provided you don't know what you're talking about.
"But Ricky, let me just check, 'cause I may got this wrong, just check with you that there are some friends that you've got who do use who are still concerned about you. Did I get that right?"

What does it feel like to live in the middle of the world?
"Yeah, and then I suppose also like money is linked into that as well, you know, I've been not doing as many courses and stuff as I used to be doing, 'cause I don't have the money."

"Right, right. Right, right, right and left."
"Well, as I think you know, Methamphetamine use is associated with some health risks. And the amount that you're using it puts you in a category that we consider a risky user. And that contrasts with someone who it says addicted, um, someone who's a heavy user, but it's not in a healthy category because people who use Methamphetamine tend to run to a number of consequences. And actually one of them is sexually transmitted diseases."
It could be because I was high when I had unprotected sex and I would not do that if I were not high.
So you're normally very careful and you use protection when having sex?

And I-I can't go back there. There's no way I'm going to go there.
"Right. So you could sit yourself up and take the risk, but on the other hand, you know that actually it might not last?"
"No, never lasts, never can, never will."
You seem like a bit of a crossroads to me.
"""I've been in crossroads for 12 years,"" he said."

"12 years. Okay. So she stood by you then for the time, [crosstalk] but this time she said, it happens again I'm out of here?"
"Yeah, she's actually got the black and white line down now."
It sounds like you're listening to that black and white line.

"""Everyone will age, but that will happen on time,"" he said."

Yeah. So catch me up with the conversations you've had with Fiona about this crossroads you're at.
"She hasn't even talked about the dealing, like, she won't even broach that subject. That's how black and white she is."
Are things starting to get tense at home and your relationship a little bit tense?

Yeah. Don't put words in your mouth.
"No, they are not, or should not be."
Is there any way to know if you are gay?
"I mean, not like they have been because we have only just started on the new road, but I mean, yeah, tense is the right word."
"I'd like to talk about this all-the-time idea, Daryl, that's this crossroads idea, yep? So on the one hand, you've got this 12 year history of being in the other system and done some time and being away from Fiona, but you're now back, sitting back together, and you have some choice about where to go."
"I don't know. I haven't got little, um, nuggets of where I could go. I've just got this feeling that I should go somewhere."
"What are your thoughts on going something different, but the direction doesn't seem to be that clear?"
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
It [unintelligible 00:09:33] is picking up?

Why do you think he made the transition from being a drug counselor to a crime counselor?
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
-to a transition about being in a new place.
I think he would have found some higher power. I'm not gonna find one of them.

"Oh, sadness. You know, I don't wanna wallow, you know?"
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
I never did. I just never did not do.
"I'm interested in this idea, let's, uh-- Opportunities come and go all the time."
Do they do? Do they? How do they do it?
"They do, they do, and they do do."
"All right. Not to me, but to you."
Well you said you had an opportunity to pick up and start dealing again.

Why is it hard to see opportunities in one world?

"I-- I-- Hmm, maybe I should."
"I understand that you're not convinced at the moment, I understand that and, um—"
"No. You know, convince me because I kind of want to be."
Is there any way to convince you of this?
"Right, right. Right, right, right and left."
I-I have no interest in actually you falling over and going back into a lifestyle 'cause I know where it'll take you.
Mm. is the same time as Mm.
"So it seems like what's gonna push this direction, just tip that balance a little bit to give this other world of go?"
"It is the little things, like waking up and having a cup of tea and sitting on the porch is kind of cool."
"It's kind of cool, what do you think of it?"

So I'm picking up this world that actually has freedom to you to be your own man?

Is there a challenge you're up to to start creating some-some of that sort of world for Fiona?
"I have just come out of prison, I don't have any NCEA. You know? I've got no qualifications. All my mates are working awesome jobs, mining for 160K a year, you know?"

Is it first step into the pro-social life?
"I am trying to get a job, maybe and get into some routine."
"I just know if I get a job that I hate, I won't do it."

Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
So you haven't done that. So tell me what that's about.
"I just told myself I would not this time and then Fiona said, ""You will not"" this time."
"So you told yourself you wouldn't, so you're the sort of guy that once you make a decision you're going to go, you're staunch with that decision?"
"Yeah, even if it is the wrong one."
It's a decision whether it's right or wrong and it's not gonna be-
"Yeah, but I'm that kind of guy, too."
"Yeah, you're that guy, so you make a decision you're not gonna go back to dealing."
"No, there wasn't a decision to made, I just said, ""I won't yet."""

How do I know if I'm listening to you well enough to know that you're listening to me?
Mm. is the same time as Mm.
I'm picking up that Fiona's set the bottom line.
"I'm 12, nearly 13. How old is that?"
"Nearly 13 years, so and so-so stuck with you, and I'm pick up that's important to you, um, and-and-and yet you talk about it, it just seems easy."
Mm. is the same time as Mm.
"This other lifestyle over here though when we talk about, actually thinking about, you know, doing stuff, doing the stuff that everybody else generally does, [unintelligible 00:22:30] will gets on doing, it doesn't have that same sort of feel to excitement, and doesn't seem to be a-a starting point for you over here."
"""It-it does kinda seem like it does."""
Does it really work? Why or why not?
"""It does, because it's so different,"" he said."
"Right, okay, okay. How do I do it?"
I'm over that one. And I'm not over it.
"I'm over that one, okay, so let's start to think about what is the first step."

And for him this 12 -- you wondered that the 12 -- step stuff was working for him.
"Yeah-yeah, it does work for him, right?"
What would it take to have a conversation with him?
"""I'm ringing him,"" he said. ""How do you know?"""
Ringing him? What is your opinion of him?
"Mm, yeah. How do you describe it?"
"Yeah. You seem a little surprised, I'm-I'm [crosstalk] wondering about your surprise face."
It was a long time ago that we were inside. I just know that's what he's doing. It would be pretty odd calling but the- he would probably be okay with it.
Is there any possibility to call someone in the future?
"Is there a possibility to call yes? If so, how?"
Is there a possibility that there is a possibility of a nuclear war?
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?

I just have to do what I'm told.
"Yeah, but I'm picking up though that doing what you're told, she has some hopes."

What do you think about her hopes and sharing them?

Is there any way to know if you have any questions?
"What is the whole plan to call-call-call up you know and say, Hey bro, hey bro, uh, how did you do that?"
How do you know if someone has made a different decision on the path that starts over here? I'm wondering. I wonder whether you might have wisdom about what it's like to tread that path?
"Like, I guess I could be wondering that too."
"""So you know there's a part of you going, I was thinking in this place that's hard work,"" he said."

It's really getting in the way of becoming who you want to be.
Is it true that it is true that there is a sexual relationship?
How do you know if your criminal record is blocking you from getting where you want?
"I don't know what about it, um—"
"There's a, uh, conviction. What is it?"
Yeah. And it has a felony conviction on it.
"Ah, there's-oh, there is-"
"And, uh-huh—and, uh, uh—"
"-the big trouble. Yeah, the big trouble, yeah."
"Yeah, it is. And it's- I hadn't anticipated that it would have been-- you know, so at the time, it was just like, ""Okay, cool. I'm not going to jail."""
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"You know, and, um, now it's like, okay, so this is more like a life sentence than it was a four-year sentence that they were offering."
"Mm-hmm. So when you put in applications or anything like that, the felony con-conviction seems to knock you out of the ballpark?"
"No, I don't get callbacks a lot because of that issue."
"Mm-hm, mm-hmm. How is it?"
"- I'm sure. The ones that really count are the ones that are kind of just, you know, uh, making me so angry and, youknow, kind of spilling over into the rest of my life, especially after a really good interview."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"""I'm sorry. I can't really do much for you. I have to go,"" you know, and it's—"
Do you know about the felony conviction before you go for the interview?
"No. I mean, there's different situations, you know, sometimes they ask and I say something like ""We'll discuss at interview"". Uh, sometimes, there are situations where if I probably put that, I don't get a callback and those situations I don’t know about."
"""Seems like it's a done deal,"" he said."
Yeah. It seems like it's a done deal. You just have to go through the motion of having the interview and then-
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"When I go through the interview and it goes well, they're like, ""Okay, well, you know, I think we can do something"" and then, ""Here, sign this, sign that,"" and the other thing."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
And what is it like to live in this world?
"So you didn't hurt anybody, and you did not hurt anybody."
"No, I didn’t, I did not."
"You didn't hurt anything, right? How did you feel?"
It's really frustrating because it's so frustrating.
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"I feel like I don't wanna give up but it's like I'm not given any other choice, you know?"
"Yeah, 'cause you're-you're, especially with going back to school and doing all that footwork and stuff. I mean, you really have something to offer somebody."
"I do, yeah, I do, and I do."
"Yeah. And at the time the big crisis was actually maybe prison and all the crisis around the arrest and-and, uh, you know, it's like you're a leper and leper colony."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
How often have you started the interview with that conversation so that you don't have to go through the whole thing and then get rejected?
"No, not that I can think of, no, no."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
I think—I think that I think that—
What would happen to you if you did that?
I'm probably going to get booted out right away.
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
-you know? Um-uh-huh?
"What would that be like versus getting through this great interview knowing you're good for the job and all that kind of stuff, and then they boot you out?"
"It sucks either way, you know what I mean?"
"Mm-hmm. It's, uh, I mean the lesser of two evils is that what we're getting at the moment."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"If it's gonna make things more efficient like if-if you're what you're trying to say is if that's something that I could do and then if they get past it, then now I know that there is an actual intention by the hiring people to hire me."
What do you think about the interview being based on your criminal record?
"As far as maybe efficiency, you know, weeding out the things, not wasting my time, but I had to tell you something, a lot of people don't care about that type of thing."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"These are not the sort of jobs I really wanna be doing. You know what I mean? Um, I don't know, it's just really frustrating."
"Do you work for the government or for a bank or, you know, the FBI where- those are not things you're applying for."
"""It should be an issue,"" he said."
"Right, right. Right, right, right and left."
"Right, and then the other thing is anybody that I could tell that to-"
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
-that doesn't care-that does not care
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
-are probably not jobs that are worth going to get the interview.
"Mm-hmm, you didn't go to college for college."
"Right, right. Right, right, right and left."
Mm. is the same time as Mm.
I don't- I'm not looking to be a mover or-
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"-A burger flipper or something like that. Not that there's anything wrong with it, but I feel like I have a little bit more to offer."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
It's like being caught between a rock and a hard place.
"Mm-hmm. So, what have you looked into?"
"I have done, and my eyes have just become like mush after all the reading I've done on this situation."
How did you find out about the death of your father?
"I found out that I have a felony that's expungable, I don't even have the type that's sealable. I have apparently the type of felony that has to go on the governor's desk next to death row, you know, inmates or the candidates for, um, a gov- a governor's pardon."
Huh. Uh-huh. What do you mean?
"""I mean, there needs to be, if any, you know, options, the only option I have is for, um, governor's clemency,"" he said."
"I-I didn't know that. So I, you know, I know a little bit about it, but not, yeah. So that's-that's very interesting. Oh, what about advocacy groups?"
I’ve looked into a few groups that are supposedly helping convicted felons get out of prison.
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
What is the difference between doing work and doing work?
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
What I saw was a whole bunch of dead end jobs.
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"And the other thing that I saw was that it was very politically charged. You know, I didn't think that I was allowed to get an interview right away with one of those counselors that they offer. Um, I-- it just didn't seem like a type of place that was willing to help, you know. And-and, uh, I saw that there was a lot of, um, I wouldn't say racism but I would say a little bit of racial favor."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
How do you know if you are a girl?
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
How do you know if there is anything out there?
"Mm-hmm. So you're Middle Eastern, so you wonder-- I-I bet you've had experiences where you've experienced some absolute racism and prejudice because of that."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
You walk into these places and they might just be storefront-
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
-type places and the job market is terrible.
"Right. It's-it's, uh-there is a lot stacked up against me."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"""Let's just put it like that,"" he said."
Mm-hmm. Mm-Hmm. How is it?
"You know, you know, but that isn't—"
What are some of the things you have going for you?
What is the difference between a conversation and a conversation?
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"At some point, I would imagine that I strike up conversation with the right person-"
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"That would probably want to hire me regardless of that sort of thing. Um, I think that at this point in time it doesn't really matter what degree you have. I don't believe that it matters where you went to school. I think it's all about who you know."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"It's been seven years now and getting jobs. And I think that, you know, if I continue to go to school, I should get time from that felony."
"It's a long time, but it is a good time."
"Yeah. And I probably don't even have to report it, you know, and I have that going for me. It's been seven years. I have the fact that I'm very good at interacting with people, that's good."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"I've been clean from that sort of lifestyle for a long time so that's-that's- that's up for me, you know, that's good. Um—"
"""And you can prove that and document that,"" he said."
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"""A lot of folks can't,"" he said."
"If they don't, why do they do it?"
"Yeah. And you've been going to school. I mean, all your movement is in this really positive, highly motivated way."
"Yeah. Well, that's my hope, that is my hope."
"It's individual. Yeah, it's individual, right?"
"""Yeah. That's my hope,"" he said."
"It-it is individual, it is individual and individual."
"It is, it should be. You know, I-I—"
"It is true, I believe it is true."""

"There's no -- I don't think, any state or federal law that says that."
"No, no. It is an individual, but you're right. Yeah. It's—"
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
But here's the thing is that is the thing.
"The right person, the right company-right company-"
"Right, right. Right, right, right and left."
"-we're looking for here. Yeah, we're looking."
"I mean, there's a lot of situations where people's reports are not even accurate."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"I think that- I think that, I think-"
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
Why are people implementing these types of security measures when they don't have any efficiency with them?
I wonder what it would be like if you ran your own background check and got the report to see what is in there.
"I have, I have, and I have to."
How do you know if you have done something wrong in your life?
"Yeah, I do. I have one and, uh, I have two."
"""Good for you doing that,"" he said."
"Right, yeah. Right, yeah, right, right."
"Yeah. Smart, smart, smart. And smart."
"I don't know. I'm just, I guess-"
"Discouraged, Discouraged and Discarded."
What do you mean by what I am really?
"""Discouraged, yeah,"" he said. """
I'm really here because I think I'm- I-I- it's a very dangerous area for me when I'm discouraged because-
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"Despite all the good things I have going for me, the only thing that's loud and clear are the things I don't have going to me."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"If that makes any sense, how does it make sense?"
"Why do you feel like you can sell yourself and your skills and the fact that you've overcome so many things like, um, substance abuse problem and, uh, a good upstanding citizen all this time?"
Thank you very much for your time and your support.
"What about, um, I know I had a client that told me a couple of things. He was doing some work on this, uh, if you're interested I could tell you what he shared with me."
"Yeah, yeah, I am. And I am very happy."
"""I found the most valid information on blogs done by felons,"" he said."
"""Oh, okay,"" he said. ""I'm sorry."""
"""They are your experts,"" he said. ``"
"Very interesting, very interesting, and very funny."
"And they-they are actually, uh, Uh, much what you have said, they said, but they also talked about which places and companies they did find were open. For instance, family-owned businesses just tend to do what they can, if they can--"
"Yeah, again, it's like who you know."
"Right, right. Right, right, Right, Right."
I know that- I know that I know.
Or start your own business. That was another thing I thought was really--
"It's not no Fortune 500 company or anything, but I do have a little bit of income coming in from that. So that's what I'm sort of involved with now."
Huh. Uh-huh. What do you mean?
"""It-it, it will all come together,"" he said."
So being an entre- being an entrepreneur fit for you.
"What do you think of the law that says you can't work with kids or, um, like a hazmat stuff?"
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"""Like truck driving and stuff like that,"" he said."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"Uh, but that doesn't matter to me. You know what I- you know, I'm kind of trying to look at the things I can do."
"Well, you know, that's a-a really different way of looking at it than how you were looking at what you can do versus what you know you can't do."
"Right, right. Right, right, right and left."
"So, what is this business? What is it? If you don't have to tell me if you don’t want, I know it’s on the up and up, but I don't want to tell you if you do not want."
"No, it's a party planning event, you know, like a wedding planning, not like the wedding planner, but like the party planning—"
"You'd be so good at that, if you could do it."
"Like corporate events when they have, you know, like an event that they need-"
Huh. Uh-huh. What do you mean?
"They need chauffeured transportation, limos, they need that type of thing."
"""You-you would be the corporate company,"" he said."

What are some of the funniest jokes you have ever heard?
"I don't know about that, but I know."
"I mean, I- I've heard that-that in recession, the best opportunities for people to start doing business is to see an area where you see a need go in and fill it."
"Yeah, I think that's my only, uh, Uh, I know it's not my only-"
"One, two, three, four, five, six."
"But it's-it's a good opportunity to, um, kind of work for myself, you know?"
"You're comfortable with that, how do you feel about it?"
"I am, I am comfortable with it and I do well at-at, you know, the few opportunities I've had to organize something like that. Um, it's okay. You know, um, at least I'm still going to school. I know that I'm going to be done with that."
"I know, that's fantastic. It is."
"I don't want to act out. I mean, I'm, you know, I think that I have-"
What would you do if you were acting out in a movie?
"How do you go back to a lifestyle, you know, crime or, um, using destructive behavior?"
Gottcha. Okay. Gottcha. Go on.
"-and sort of destructive behavior. I don't wanna be destructive, you know."
"Like you are now, you are like you were then."
"Is it okay to drop out of school and just, you know, I mean, that's not a viable option for me? You know what I mean?"
So the law of felony convictions is something that you don't have any control over.
"Yeah. I mean, I just recently had one of those where I was going to be offered. I think he was pretty sure he was offering me a really good job."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"And, uh, it was an interview given to me by my brother, you know, who knew the guy. And, um, it went great until he gave me the paperwork to sign for a background check."
"Did your brother know that when he gave you the lead on the job, that there was a background check involved?"
"No, he did. He said, you know, don't say anything until you know what he said. I think he said he's not sure if they do."
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
"He said, just go ahead and give it a shot anyway, you know, and I just, I figured I'd just give her a shot, but I think I like your, I think to spare myself some, uh, frustration and further agony-"

"-I think that I might try that, you know, from now on you know that I don't wanna be blunt about it and go, ""Do you hire criminals?"""

"A plus shining new guy, a plus shining old guy."
What do you think about society being less forgiving to a new guy?
"I think so, too, but I think so."
"I think that's a really good idea is to kind of weed out, you know, but how do you say that?"
What do you think about saying something like that?
"Hmm. Seems, uh, sort of forward, you know, but I-I think that it's probably better if I don't tell them so I don’t waste my time and hope."
"Mm-hm, mm-hmm. How is it?"
I think I'm gonna try that from now on.
"I mean, I'd be happy if you wanna work on a few, you know, things, uh, to write down that sound comfy and fit and fit like words and stuff."

"I mean, even though you get turned down, that feels terrible. The actual and, I bet you with every single one of them, you get better at it."
Yeah. I mean the interview process and the process.
"""Uh-huh, Uh-Huh,"" he said."
"No, I don't think I ever have a problem with the interview process."
Yeah. I bet you are even better now.
"Yeah. It's been a lot, and it's been good."
"""You got lots of practice,"" he said. ``"
"Been a lot, yeah, and a lot of fun."

What are some of the medications that actually take away cravings?
"Like, I did a pill thing, so I did try it. I just did the pills and they didn't work."
Mm-hmm. Yeah. How do I know?
It was a waste and caused more side effects.
"It's not a waste. Research shows that people take on average about seven tries to quit smoking, so think of it as you're one step closer to quitting, so--"
"Or seven lectures along the road, or seven lectures each."
"Well, I don't think I'm giving you a lecture. That's certainly not what I meant."
"I'm not a complete fool, I just feel that way. I get really -- I get very defensive about when they bring-- cause I get it from my family doc, from my cardiologist, everybody."
"Well, there's a reason that some people are concerned."
"It's not easy to quit, but it is not easy."
"Is it true that you've tried the medication, you've been willing once to try the medication?"
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
Can we write you a prescription for the medication?
I guess I got to really want to and the things I've tried usually caused more problems than they helped.
"The smoking is going to cause you more problems than anything else, David."
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
The side effects are nothing compared to what can happen from smoking.
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
I think that's the thing to really consider.

"What is the meaning of the word """"so""""?"""
"I have some good news and some not-so-good news. It looks like you don't have any cavities, so that's the good news."
"""That's great,"" he said. ""That is great."""
"""I'm pretty concerned about something in your mouth that I'm noticing,"" he said. ""I'm noticing a lot of irritation that is really consistent with tobacco use. And you had said on your form that you're not a tobacco user, so I'm just wondering what's going on."""
I don't smoke cigarettes and I don't drink alcohol.
"As I said, there's a lot of irritation, in particular, like I was mentioning, in the roof of your mouth, it's turned really definitely white-colored and there's little red spots."
Why do I like to go out to lounges?
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"You know, sometimes they're those- those, uh, nice young men that gift you different sorts of things. We got some of those mini cigars that are Swisher sweets, they come in peach and-and grape and- and, you know, that's the only time that I've ever really used anything that's got tobacco in it."
"I think that's a pretty common misconception, because they're fruit-flavored, people think they're okay. Those are really bad for you, did you know that?"
"They're just little, mini, little, cute little girly cigars."
"What are the same kinds of things that cause lung cancer, oral cancer, emphysema, all those same types of things you would see with cigarette, so it's really important."
"I only use them to relax. I mean, it's not like it's something that I would smoke 20 or 30 cigarettes a day, I mean I only do it when we go out."
"I mean, at least you're not doing that, so that's good, but it's still causing a lot of problems."
"Well, I didn't really know I was starting."
What do you mean by what does it mean to say?
"I didn't really think that it was anything more than social drinking, just something that I do in a social setting when me and my friends go out to the bars."
What should I do if I quit my job?
Is there any way to know if this is true or not?
"""I mean, maybe,"" he said, ""I just told you how bad it is for you. It's messing up your mouth, you're putting yourself at risk for all these other diseases."""
"Well, it's something I have to think about."
What do you think about what you're doing?
"Well, it's just something that I do to relax, and I don't do it that often. So I probably could cut back."
"Well, that's a good start, but cutting back isn't going to do it. If you actually quit smoking, you can reverse all the damage you've done in your mouth, and you can stop yourself from being at risk for other diseases. But as long as you're continuing to use these cigars, you're really putting yourself in a lot of danger."
"Do you believe that cigars are real? I do believe that it's a choice and it's my right, and it is something that I choose to do. And so I will think about cutting back, but I'm not at a point where I'm ready to do that."
"I don't know if you notice that your teeth might be getting yellower than they were before. That's another side effect. There are a lot of really negative things that go along with any tobacco use, whether it's cigarettes, cigars, dip, chew, snuffs, snus, hookah, any of it."
"Well, it's something that I will think about."
"I appreciate you thinking about it. I hope you'll think about it really hard. You know, this is something I'm gonna continue to ask you about because it's something that really needs to change."
"""It's really nice that you've come along to see me to talk about stopping smoking,"" he said."
"Good morning, everyone. How are you doing today?"
What do you have in mind for what do you want from us?
"I need some medication, if you can offer me some."
"""We're in the right place,"" he said."
And whatever else you can do to get me to go smoke-free.
"""Well, just remind me again why it is you want to stop."""
My friends have stopped smoking and it's kind of they're looking at me weird these days that I'm the only one who's still smoking.
"Oh, good, and feel under pressure here."
"The other night I was at the restaurant, it was a bit embarrassing I'm the only one walking out."
And so that can't feel a little uncomfortable being by yourself.
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
What are the other reasons for your decision to leave the US?
"""It's expensive these days,"" he said."
How much does it cost to buy a week's worth of food?
"It's-it's about -- Um, I'll buy and go through a pack a day, so it's about £7."
What is £7 a week or $7 a day?
"The price today is £7 a day, so-"
So your pack a day is a pack of packs a day.
"-you're talking about £40, uh-"
"£50 a week, or $50 a month."
"£50 a week, or $50 a month."
"There is even more mess, you see, you can see."
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
So we're talking about spending £50 a week?
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
-being one of the few left smoking in your crowd and not liking the smell. That sounds like three reasons.
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
Do you think that is enough to say goodbye to cigarettes?
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
How do you know when you should stop smoking?
What do you think of what you do in the world?
"Generally, it works well if you find a time when you're not under a huge amount of stress and strains."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
What are some of the main reasons to smoke?
Why do I smoke cigarettes when I'm bored?
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"I go out sometimes, but as I said, I'm the only one kind of outside."
What do you think you will miss most about the movie?
"The -- Um, it takes away a lot of my stress."
"Mm-hmm, what sort of stresses do you have?"
"Just, uh, when I- when I go down for a break at work."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"I never go down, I just need a break away from it all, just shut off. So, I-I really enjoyed that. The cigarette just helps me calm down."
What are some of your favorite cigarettes of all time?
It is definitely the one at the end of the evening.
So the end of the day is the end-of the day?
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"-the thing that helps you just unwind, put an end to work and move into your own time."
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
What do you do after you've had the quit date?
"I guess I'll just have fresh air as well, but this time without a cigarette in my hand but to try and give myself regular breaks, I don't know."
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
It's one of those tough things that you have to deal with.
What is the best way to quit smoking in the future?
"I've managed for a couple of weeks, I think I can manage."
How did you get back to your old self?
"It was, to be honest, stress from an argument with my partner I remember."
So something just happened that happened to me-something just happened.
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
-so it took you back into it. All right. Let me just make sure I've understood what's going on here.
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"The main reason that you smoke is because, at the end of the day, it gives you a kind of relaxation, and if there's quite a little stress that's going on that you're using cigarettes to cope with, it helps you cope."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
What do you think is the best time to quit?
I guess I have a party coming up at the weekend.
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
"""So, uh, maybe Monday morning,"" he said."
"So Monday morning after the party will be a good day, and that's next week."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
Is there anything you would like to do to help me manage cravings?
Yeah. I'm thinking of one of these patches.
"So a patch is something you have already seen, and-"
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"We strongly recommend that people stay on the whole course of medication and that that gives you the best chance of success. Stopping smoking is not easy but it's possible and with the type of support that we offer here in the pharmacy, you absolutely make your chances of success four times greater than trying on your own."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
I'm thinking that you should use two products at the end of the day when you're craving for a cigarette. What does it feel like when you can't have one?
I just get irritable. How can I deal with it?
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"I'm looking to stop nicotine withdrawal, and that's exactly one of the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal."
What does it feel like to live in the middle of the world?
"I would strongly recommend that you have the patch. I'll talk to you about how to use that and that we have another product that I leave you to use when any of those feelings of irritation are coming up, particularly in that first week."
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
"So, you're happy with the date of the date?"
"Yeah, absolutely, absolutely. How do you explain that?"
Do you want to come back and see me again?
Can you tell me if it is true that you are pregnant?
What would you like me to do if I don't come back?
"""A nice phone call,"" he said. ""A nice call."""
"""I'd be very happy to do that,"" he said."
"I mean, so I wrote a prescription for an antibiotic for Aiden and that should help with the ear infection, but it seems like he's had six or seven of these just in the past year or so."
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"""That's really a big problem,"" he said. """
"Yeah, it's pretty stressful for both of us, he gets really upset."
What is the primary risk factor for multiple ear infections in kids?
"Yeah, I do smoke, but I don't smoke around him. I try really hard not to smoke."
What can you tell me about the fact that he's having these ear infections?
"I don't know. I mean, I try really hard not smoke around him. I don't smoke in the car. Um, when he's home I go outside to smoke. I just don't want him to be around it."
I really need you to quit smoking. Both for your health and for Aiden. Did you know that smoking around your child is associated with ear infections?
What do you do when you don't smoke?
"Now's the time to quit smoking. It's really gotten to the point where you can't keep smoking. Not only for him, like I said, but also for you. You're putting yourself at risk for lung cancer, for emphysema, for oral cancers, for heart disease, for all kinds of things."
"I know, I know. I've heard-- people have told me before, I have heard all that. I just don't know how to do it. How do I quit?"
"There's all kinds of things that you can use now. It's not as hard as it used to be. You can use nicotine replacement. There's patches, there's lozenges, there is the inhaler, and there's nasal spray. We can talk about medications."
I just don't have time for all of that.
"There's no reason why you should not be able to quit, this is really important."
"I understand that. I know it is. I mean, everybody has problems, right?"
What is more important to you than your child?
I don't know. How do I know?
I really need you to tell me that you're going to quit smoking.
"I'm going to go look at all those things and- and I'll find-- I guess I'll try to find something, and-and I'll talk to my doctor about it."
"I think you really need to think about this seriously. Like I said, it's putting yourself and your child in danger."
"OK, whatever. Okay, okay, okay. Okay."
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
What is the best way to ask Sarah about smoking?
"Yeah, I guess I guess, but I guess not."
How much is smoking over the course of a day?
"Uhm, yeah, you know, like once in the morning, uh, once during my lunch break and then in the evening maybe like five or six."
"Okay. So about eight cigarettes, so just under half a pack?"
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
What is the difference between time and period of change?
It's probably been over the past year or so that I've been smoking a little more.
So the smoking has increased over the past year. And that's mainly in the evening?
"Yeah. Um, I have a two-year-old son as I mentioned, so I try to never smoke around him. So I'm usually just waiting until he gets to bed."
"Well, that's the time you can relax and unwind."
How do you enjoy the time to yourself in the afternoon?
It's a time to relax and you've got a lot going on.
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
What is the best thing to do in the evening?
"I mean, maybe I'll have a drink or two."
How many drinks do you have over the course of a day?
"I think I have two max max max, I think."
How many drinks would you say you have over the course of a week?
"I don't know why you're asking me that. I mean, I just came here for a regular visit. I-I am not here to talk about my drinking."
"I understand that you have a lot going on, but I'm certainly not here to tell you what to-to do, Sarah."
"Yeah, I guess I guess, but I guess not."
"Well, we do know that an increase in smoking is associated with certain kinds of cancer; colon cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer and, um, also pancreatic cancer. It's also associated with liver and lung disease as well as heart disease, diabetes and hypertension. So that's a lot of information, but I'm-"
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"Sarah, I'm not interested in what your thoughts are."
"I'm just kinda surprised because I don't smoke or drink that much. And I mean, compared to people I work with, you know, I-I smoke a lot less and I feel like I've actually been trying to keep it pretty low."
So you're consciously trying to cut back on your weight.
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
I have a readiness ruler in my pocket. 0 means not ready to stop smoking at all and 10 means absolutely ready to quit smoking. How do you see yourself on that scale?
I'm a five. I'm a six.
What is the difference between a five and a four?
"You brought up some kinda scary stuff like cancer risk or other things like that. And you know, being a mother, I don't want something to happen to me."
"Right. Well, that's a lot of information."
"I mean, I could maybe cut back in the evenings a little bit."
"Okay, great. Let's quantify that a little bit. How many cigarettes would that be?"
"I could try to smoke three in the evening plus, you know, still the couple during the day."
So you're cutting back quite a bit. That's a big step.
"""Yeah. Sure,"" he said. ""Yeah."
"What is the best way to go over your laboratory results at that time, as well as your plan for smoking cessation?"
"Yeah, I-I think that would be very helpful, I think."
I've got a brochure here and this has-- it's a really good brochure. It has some distraction techniques in it in case you get those nicotine cravings.
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"I've been helpful to patients before, but I'd also like to ask you, would you be willing to see a counselor?"
What do you mean by what is the what?
The National Guidelines recommend that women drink no more than seven drinks per week to avoid the healthcare concerns that we spoke of earlier.
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"You've indicated that your alcohol consumption is a bit higher than that, putting you at risk. So that's why I asked you if you'd be willing to talk to Dr. Kirtley."
But I'm still not sure about the whole drinking thing.
"Certainly, certainly. I'm glad you're willing to talk to him. So before you leave here today, we'll, uh, stop by the scheduler's desk and make an appointment for you to see me back in four weeks, as well as the appointment with Dr. Kirtley."
"""I don't think so,"" he said."
I'm very nice to meet you. I'll see you in a month.
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
"Hi, Sandra. How are you doing in New York?"
Hi. How do I know you are a good friend?
"Thanks for coming in for a couple of minutes. I understand you don't have very much time, but I really appreciate you stopping by."
"I came today because my daughter is in the hospital. I think it's important to quit smoking, but I enjoy smoking. I'm not ready to give it up right now. My life is too much in turmoil."
What are some of the things you were thinking about when you came to the hospital with your daughter?
"I think it's important because I feel like I'm a bad role model for my children, and my daughter's turning 12, and already, some of her friends have tried smoking, so I don't want her to think it is a good thing."
The last thing you'd want is your daughter to start smoking.
"I smoked when I was young, and I certainly don't want it for my daughter."
"Hmm. And it sounds like your smoking, setting an example, those are some things that you're also, uh, a bit concerned about, but not really ready to put down your cigarettes immediately."
I'm just not ready for this right now.
What is the best thing about smoking? What do you like about it?
"It's very enjoyable, relaxing, you know, a stress reliever. When I'm at work, we all go out and smoke and chit chat and talk about things."
What is the best thing about this movie and why?
"I like a cigarette after I eat. It sort of tells my brain I'm finished, stop eating, I'm full. So it's a way to control my weight."
Is there anything else you like about the movie?
"I think it's not good for me, I know, but I'm so used to smoking I don't really think about quitting too much."
"So make sure that I understand all of the good things about smoking, the things that you like about it and let me know if I missed anything or left anything out."
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
So it sounds like it's a way to relax.
"That's true. Yeah, that's true, too."
"You also mentioned that smoking is a way to lose weight, and concern that if you were to quit smoking, what that would do in terms of, um, gaining weight?"
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
What are some of the things that keep you smoking?
What do you think of this? How do you feel about it?
I'm hearing there are things you like about smoking. What about the other side?
"I'm worried about my children. I feel like I'm being a bad parent, and I often wonder, you know, if they've seen me smoking for years. I certainly don't want my 12-year-old daughter to start smoking, and some of her friends are already smoking."
What are some examples of a time you did something that you think left an impression on your daughter or set a bad example for her?
"Yeah, just this morning, I was outside having a cigarette, and then when I looked up, there she was looking out the window at me."
"So this morning, that experience brought home how she does watch you, and she does really look up to you and notice what you do. How did that feel when you looked up and saw her watching you?"
"I felt terrible, you know, I was projecting that I wanna be a good parent, and I don't feel this really is part of the plan."
"And again, thanks for your honesty in talking about this."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"How do you think smoking is important in terms of stress relief, socializing, and it's something that you can't imagine ever changing?"
"It doesn't fit, you know. It's the opposite side of the coin. You know, I love doing it, but I don't think it's right."
What would it take for you to quit smoking?
"Right now, I can't think of anything."
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
"""I don't have any plans to quit. It's just something I'm thinking about,"" he said."
"It's not so much that you don't wanna quit in a way, it's almost, ""How do I do it that would work for me?"""
What do you think of this? How do you feel about it?
I appreciate. We've probably used up the time that we have. I would love to see you next week if you'd be willing to schedule another appointment and talk with me more about this. Is that something that would be helpful?
"Oh, sure. I'll come in. Yeah."
I hear-- [crosstalk] So I hear--
"We can talk about it some more, if we want to."
Can I ask you to do a little bit of homework between now and next week?
"OK, okay, I'll give it a try, okay?"
"OK, here you go. How do I start?"
Thank you very much for your time and your support.
"So thank you for coming in, Sandra. We'll see you next week."
All right. All right. How do I proceed?
So I wrote up a prescription for antibiotics for Aiden.
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
I did wanna talk to you though. I'm a little bit concerned looking through his chart of how many ear infections he's had recently. And I-I noticed that you had checked the box that someone is smoking in the home. So I was wondering if you can tell me a little more about that.
What is the reason that I started smoking again?
It's kind of a way to relax and destress when you have a lot of things going on.
Some people have a glass of wine and some have a cigarette.
How did you decide not to smoke around him?
Is it good for him to have ear infections and asthma and stuff?
"So you're worried about how your smoking is affecting him and on the other hand, you're not so sure if it's really the smoking that is causing these problems?"
"He doesn't have asthma. Yeah. He doesn't-- he hasn't had a lot of other problems that his other friends have, so. And I've thought about quitting before, but I just don't see how it's possible right now."
Why did you quit smoking when you were pregnant?
And I didn't think I could live with myself if something happened to him.
"Right now, though, it feels almost too difficult."
"Yeah, exactly, exactly. How do you explain that?"
How were you successful when you quit before you had quit?
"I don't know. I-I think about it now, I don't even know how I did it. I just- I just did it, you know?"
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"I had problems and stuff like that, all the stuff they talk about with women who smoke. So I was just enough to say, ""Okay, you know what, I'm not going to risk that."""
The risks were so scary then that you were able to stop them?
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
But they don't feel scary to you now?
"No, I mean, we're two separate people. Like I said, I don't, I try really hard not to smoke around him. I'm pretty good about that. I-I don't let other people smoke around me. Um, so I, you know."
"""You're doing the best you can do,"" he said."
Is there any way to know if you have any questions about this?
But it sounds to me like part of you really wants to quit?
Is there any way to quit smoking in New Year’s?
"It's on your to-do list, but it's not making it to the top."
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"If you did decide not to quit on a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is not at all confident, and 10 is you feel pretty certain that you could do it, where do you think you should fall right now?"
"Probably like a 5, kind of in the unsure area. Like I know I can do it before, so I know that I can, but at the same time it just seems really hard. And it's not the same situation."
What makes you say five rather than two or three?
"I know- I know all the ways it's bad for me. And I don't want him to grow up thinking that it's okay to smoke. I want him not to-to use any kind of tobacco or anything like that. Um, so I know I need to, especially before he gets old enough to understand what mommy's doing. I just don't know if I can do it."
"So you have a lot of reasons why you would like to quit. You have been successful quitting in the past, but right now you're just feeling a little bit hesitant about your ability to do it?"
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
Where do you think we should start from here?
"I don't know. I-I'd like some help, I just don’t know what kind of help I need."
"If you'd be interested, that's something I can definitely talk to you about."
I don't like medicine. How can I stop it?
"There's also a lot of support groups and classes that you can take where you have other people to go through it with. And sometimes just having that support can be a big part of it, especially for people like you where smoking is such a stress reliever."
"That sounds nice, but I'm not sure if I have the time to do all that."
"""I feel like something that would take up a lot of time and maybe not fit into your life."""
"""That would be really nice,"" he said."
How do we set up another appointment for you to come in and we could talk more about that?
"I would like that, that would be great."
What is the best way to say that you are a good guy?
Thank you very much for your time and your support.
Is there any way to know if you have any questions?
"The hard part is over, so the good news is no cavities."
"""Oh, great,"" he said, ""that was great."""
I am always happy to hear that. I do have some concerns though because I'm seeing some irritation in your mouth in the palate that is called nicotinic stomatitis and-
"""That sounds bad,"" he said, ""but it is."""
"Yeah, it is. It's damage to the roof of your mouth from tobacco smoking, so I'm wondering if you can tell me a little bit about how tobacco fits in your life right now."
"I don't smoke cigarettes. Well, I've never smoked cigarettes. I do go out with my friends. Um, you know, we go out to bars and have a few drinks and smoke some of those little cigarillo-type things. I mean I don't even think of them as cigars and they're certainly not cigarettes."
"So you have made a decision in your life not to smoke cigarettes, that's something you didn't want to do. It sounds like you're kinda concerned about the health effects of cigarettes. But you have been smoking the little cigarillos every time you go out."
"But that's- that's just like a social thing. That's something that my friends and I do. It's not habit or something that I have to have and, you know, talking about one or two when we go out for an evening."
"Yeah, so you're not like those chain smokers. You're not smoking packs and packs of cigarettes a day."
"No, no, no. No, no no."
The amount you smoke is so small that you can't even imagine that it would cause any harm and yet here it is damaging the roof of your mouth.
What are some of these Swisher Sweets?
"Uh-huh. So smoking has kind of become a big part of social life now. When you go out, you're smoking, and even during breaks at work, you are smoking."
"It's true that you say it like that it's true. Um, I am smoking on a daily basis."
What are some of the things you like about social life?
"And it's nice to be with people, Um. Um, and you know, when we go to Las Vegas, it's really fun to go to the cigar bars, is kind of sophisticated and fun and so, you know."
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
"I wouldn't say I was a chain smoker, but I am a smoker."
What are some of the not-so-bad things about smoking?
"I was going to ask you about whitening my teeth, but I've noticed that they have more stains on them than a few years ago, and so I imagine that has something to do with the smoking."
Are there any other things that you are concerned about?
"Um. Well, there's the expense, you know. Wi-with the economy and all, I have to be careful about my money and so, um, there is the extra expense of buying more of them than I used to. So the money aspect is also a concern."
What is the health aspect of smoking cigarettes and how harmful it can be for you?
"""Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah,"" he said."
How did you know that smoking these little cigarillos can have some of the same negative health effects?
"Do you think it was a fun thing to do with my friends, certainly not a smoking habit or anything that would be harmful?"
"I mean, it's kind of surprising to you that something you've been doing and doing more and more of it is actually bad for you."
"I checked the box on your form when you asked if I smoked tobacco, I checked ""No,"" because I never thought of myself as a smoker."
Mm-hmm. What do you kind of make of that now that you realize that you're actually a tobacco user?
"I'm really concerned, I mean, I don't want to develop cancer, lung cancer, or any of the awful things that happen from smoking, and, you know, really, until this conversation, I never really thought of myself as a smoker."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"-I'm very concerned, I'm very worried."
How can I stop the progression of other diseases by quitting smoking?
Is there any way to know if you have ever met someone?
Is there something you would be interested in in the future?
I would. I really would because I'm a brand new smoker. I didn't know I was a smoker until I came to see you.
"I mean, if you think about it on a scale 1 to 10 where 1 is really don't think you could do it at all and 10 is really confident that you could quit if you tried, where do you think you fall?"
"In seven or eight years, I think I could stop doing this."
What made you choose seven or eight instead of a five?
"""I feel pretty confident that it's not a part of my daily life. I don't have to have, uh, a smoke when I get up in the morning,"" he said."
What are some of the negative effects of smoking?
"I'd really like some more information about quitting. I mean, I've heard there's some-some new medications, there are some new things that can be done to make quitting more comfortable and I-I really wanna quit."
"""Well, I'd be happy to talk to you more about that and give you some tips and advice about how to get some support."""
"""That'd be wonderful. Thank you,"" he said."
"""I really appreciate you talking to me about this."
Thank you very much for your time and your support.
"Hi Jean, I'm Dr. Selby. Nice to meet you."
"Good morning, doctor, and good morning to you all."
What is the best way to help someone in your situation?
"Well, doctor, I-I made an appointment with you finally, because I was diagnosed with a pulmonary disease, COPD."
Is there any way to know if you have any questions about this?
"And although I didn't call right away, I really need help in quitting smoking."
"Right, right. Right, right, right and left."
"So I thought, well, this is my first step. So, it's time to do something."
"It's time to do something, okay. You've been diagnosed by-"
A respirologist is a respiologist who specializes in respirology.
"A respirologist diagnosed that, and how do you feel right now?"
"I'm- I'm really scared, 'cause I don't feel well.'"
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
I haven't felt well for a while. I'm getting coughing fits even when I'm on the phone with customers.
"All right. So it sounds like you've been smoking for a long time and then this diagnosis was given to you, uh, and now that's causing you to be afraid and frightened."
Mm-hmm. I don't know what I'm going to do about this.
"OK, okay. Now, what do you think about quitting?"
"I have a feeling I'm going to fail at this point in time. I don't even have 50%, uh, faith in myself."
"I'm hearing you say that, although you want to quit smoking in the next six months, you're feeling a bit, um, under-confident that you'll actually be able to do this and you're worried about failing."
"I don't know what to do. I have tried to quit smoking. I've had, uh, I've taken pills, I took the patch."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"I've gone through therapy. Uh, nothing's helped. I finally went to the doctor. I was actually in the hospital for a week. That's the longest I've quit."
"Right. So you have been able to quit smoking, but only when you were in the hospital."
"I had no choice, I had no choices. And then the next day I was back to smoking what I smoked."
How do you know if you're having difficulty with smoking?
"""I started smoking when I was 13, 14 at home. My parents smoked. All of their friends smoked. It was on television, everybody looked so grand,"" he said."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"I didn't really think about it. It's just an extension of me, I guess."
"Right, right. Right, right, right and left."
"If I'm going through a stress, I say, ""Oh, well, I'll have a cigarette and think this out."""
Is there anything you want to know about smoking?
"""That's right,"" he said, ""that's right."""
What are the things I missed in my life?
"I enjoy it. It just relaxes me. It's great after a meal, for me-"
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"-we all just do it as a small group of people, uh, my family."
"Right, right. Right, right, right and left."
"The people I work with, we go out in the courtyard in the morning-"
Is there any way to know if you have any questions?
"A lot of people, um, we're like a little group now. We're all- a little bunch of us."
So it's hard for you to quit smoking when everybody else is smoking.
"I-I never thought of it that way, but probably you are right."
Can you tell me what is good about smoking?
It's bad for my health and it's scaring me 'cause I don't feel well.
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
I haven't felt well for a while. I'm getting coughing fits even when I'm on the phone with customers.
Is there anything that is not good about smoking?
And I'm starting to buy different makeup because my face is getting really clogged up.
"And then the cost of smoking. So the not good things or the not so good things about smoking for you are the effects of your health, effects on your physical appearance and how you look and-and-and the amount of investment that you're making in makeup and getting your nails done, et cetera."
Is there any way to know if you have any questions about this?
How important is it for you to quit smoking?
"It's for me, for my health, and for the money and everything I've said, I would say that I should quit smoking."
Definitely the most important of all the important things.
A hundred percent is one of the most important things.
Why do you feel so confident that you can quit?
I think I'm 35 or 40 percent competent.
"35-40%. Okay, okay, okay."
"I'd like to say more, but, um-"
"Now, help me understand why you said 40 and not something like 10 or zero because you mentioned that you don't want to quit."
"Well, I guess I'm still a fighter, and I'm starting to realize it and I do feel pretty good that I came to see you."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"-this was a big step, so I guess, yes. Um, it wouldn't have been as high as last week."
What would it take to build confidence in yourself?
"I want to come to see you again, or maybe some ideas were suggested, maybe if there was a group or something. I-I don't know, but I need some help."
"If you got help, that would help you say you went from 40% to 45%."
I think so because I feel a little better that I came to see you today.
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
"""I feel better when I get things out,"" he said."
"I want to congratulate you on taking this very important first step toward addressing this problem that you've had for such a long time, but I wonder whether you'd be open to actually just monitoring your smoking for the next week."
"In other words, think about it more, but don't do it automatically."
That's correct. Writing it down helps that process.
Is it possible to fight the urge when you get the urge?
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
Can I go right away when something went wrong?
What is the best way to keep track of it?
"No, that gives me something to work towards until next week."
"Well, thank you so much for coming in."
"""Thank you for seeing me, doctor,"" he said."
"""You're welcome,"" he said. ""We're welcome."""
Is it okay to go over the form you had filled out?
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"""I wrote that you drank alcohol on a few occasions in the last year, and you have used marijuana more often, 30 days in last year."""
"""Or something like that,"" he said, """
"I don't like to tell anyone what to do, if anything, about their use."
"I vape. I have a pen, but don't smoke it."
How often does it happen to me that I have to do it?
"A few times a month, or a few times per month."
Do you vape anything other than marijuana? Why or why not?
I did a peppermint oil once and someone shared it with me.
Is it okay if you share some information with me?
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"We know marijuana has effects on the developing brain. For example, it makes it harder for you to concentrate, it can make it harder to remember things, and vaping can seriously hurt your lungs. About one in six people who begin using marijuana as a teenager, later on, become addicted to it. What do you think about this?"
"""I don't think it's going to hurt me,"" he said."
How do you think it affects you and how does it affect you?
"I don't know. It makes me relax, and it makes me laugh with my friend."
What are some things about marijuana that you don't like?
I don't want to get in trouble at school.
What is the best way to get in trouble in school?
"Well, I can get suspended and I would get kicked off the basketball team."
Is it important to stay in school and play basketball?
"Right, right. Right, right, right and left."
What are some things you would like to change about marijuana use?
I was thinking to not use basketball season when basketball season start.
What would be the benefits of doing this for your family?
"""I play better when I'm not high,"" he said."
Marijuana affects how well you play. What is the other benefit?
"I wouldn't get caught with using a pen, so I wouldn't be kicked off the basketball team."
It sounds like you have a goal of not using marijuana until basketball starts. How long do you think you could not use?
"For about a month, she said, she would be home alone."
"If I asked you to pick a number, 0 through 10, 0 means you're not very confident at all in meeting your goal, or 10 means you are very confident, what number would you pick?"
I'm seven years old. What is the age of seven?
Why do you pick a seven instead of a lower number like five?
I'm pretty sure I can stop using for a month. I want to play well.
What is the best way to stop using for a month or more?
I don't know. What do you think of it?
How about this question? What will happen within a month that will make you want to vape?
If I'm stressed or unhappy that's when I usually wanna vape.
What can I do instead of vaping when I feel like that?
I like to play video games. How can I learn to play?
What is the best thing you can do to improve your health?
I have a friend who can play basketball with me.
Playing basketball and playing video games are the best way to feel better.
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
What is your plan for quitting for a month?
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"Well, Good luck with basketball practice. If you want anything or need to talk about something before our next appointment, I'm here Monday through Thursday and it's always good to see you."
"Why don't you take a rinse, and how do you feel?"
What are the best movies of all time and why?
Would you like to be a part of the conversation?
Is there any way to know if it's true?
What do you think of this? How do you feel about it?
"Oh, that was really nice, was it?"
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
You got rid of that bad-bad-thing.
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
-discoloration that was there that was not there.
"Yeah. No. No, no, No, No."
"I like that very much, I like it very much."
"""It went well. Good. Excellent,"" he said. ""I did notice quite a lot of staining."""
"""Mm. Well, the usual suspects, smoking, wine, coffee."""
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"-all of the above, and all of the below."
What is the best way to quit smoking at this age?
"It's not my cup, but I-I-I hear it from everybody, and, uh, I've tried before, didn't work. I get it all the time."
"I am one more person, the next- the next doctor who's saying, ""You need to quit smoking, David."""
"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, [unintelligible 00:01:13]"
That's not how I mean to come across at all.
"Yeah, I-I-I know I'm not an idiot and people know that smokers are, you know, ""How can I quit smoking?"""
"Mm-hmm, and if it was as easy as the doctor is saying or your partner is saying."
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
-saying--says--Saying-
Who wouldn't be in the world if you were a man?
"If you have to quit, you must quit."
You'd have to be a real fool to do it-

"If you said you were gonna make it like that, I would."
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"""I-I just hear it every day,"" he said."
Yeah. And what's been your past experience with smoking?
"I smoked for 40 years, since I was 14."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"I quit a couple of times in my 20s, but, you know, it's been consistent. And I can't see myself changing now."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"No matter what kind of talk I get or what they come up with, I get it."
It sounds like almost you've tried a lot of things out there and it's not something that you're—

"Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah and yes."

"I know cold turkey is probably the only thing that's ever gonna do it to anybody that has done it. Mysel- My group, it's been cold turkey-"
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"- and then they fight it, but it's my choice-"
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
I don't like lectures about it-and I do not like lectures on it.
"Yeah. And it really is your choice, you're absolutely right-"
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"If you were to decide that nobody has the right to tell you what to do, what would you do?"
"Hard to tell 'cause I already had open-heart surgery, that didn't do it."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"Prostate cancer, that did not do it."
"Right, right. Right, right, right and left."
I don't know. I just don't want it.
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
I just want to say that I'm sorry.
"So, this is something that you-you-want to know."
-have to-have-to-do to-
-pretty much what you see yourself doing for yourself-
"Yeah, for a while, quite a while."
I appreciate you being willing to talk about it.
"I could go for that. I-I, uh, I'm always open to some-- you know, to listen."
"As long as I don't talk too much, what should I do?"
Do you think it's funny to say that?
"OK. [chuckles] Okay, okay."
"""I had some options,"" he said. ""You're- you're--"" like, ""Why do I keep you as a patient?"""

"He’s good, though. (laughs)"
What do you think about keeping him as a doctor?
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"Yeah, and David, honestly, wherever you're at, we'll work with it."
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
Thanks for- thanks for taking a couple of minutes and talking about smoking.
"""Thanks, doc,"" he said. ""I love you."""

What is the best way to answer this question and why?
"-for a week, I tried to mark down the difference in my smoking, being more aware when I had the urge, if I could stop the urge-"
Mm. is the same time as Mm.

"So, you have been able to cut down by two or three cigarettes?"
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"So, you were able to keep the diary?"
Is there any way to know if you have any questions about this?
It's going well. What are the things that are not going as well as you'd like?
It just seemed to get worse when it was the weekend.
"Right, right. Right, right, right and left."
-and I was going out with friends and home a lot of the day-
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
I found that it was really hard to stop those urges at home.
"So, these automatic cigarettes, when you're socializing and you're-- you have time on your hands, really, what are the problems that you're facing?"
Is there any way to know if you have any questions about this?
What are some of the things you've noticed are more difficult than others?
"But I marked it in the book. Uh, that's one thing I said to myself I'll be honest in my marking down."
"""In marking it down, okay,"" he said. """
"So, I'm gonna have to be aware of the weekends. Maybe get some kind of hobby or- or join some group or something on the weekends to keep me busy."
What is the best thing you can do to overcome this?
"If I can just postpone it, how can I do it?"
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
"-and say, ""I'm not gonna have it at home."""
"Right, right. Right, right, right and left."
I'll have it when I get to work or on the way to work.
"Right, right. Right, right, right and left."
'Cause I-I-I - I- I-
Is there any way to know if you have any questions?
What I'd like to do is try not to smoke in my house.
What is it that you would like to work on?
I think I'd just like to do what I did this first week. I like the idea of marking it down.
"Okay, so you can continue with that, I think."
"I took me a week and I'm down two cigarettes a day, I figure."
Is there any way to know if you have any questions?
"""What I'd like to do is maybe go down to five cigarettes a day,"" he said."

"I smoke a large pack and a small pack, maybe just two small packs."
"""I said five cigarettes this time,"" he said."
Is there any way to know if you have any questions about this?
What is concretely possible to make it happen?
I can try to count each day to count the number.
"Right, right. Right, right, right and left."
"I'm still gonna try that when I get the urge to let it go, fight it and maybe not go out for a cigarette until the next urge comes."
Right. Left. Right. [unintelligible 00:02:58]
"If I [unintelligible 00:02:59] between two of them,"

- and also coming back and- and talking to you really helps 'cause I have someone to-
Is there any way to know if you have any questions?
I want to discuss it with someone I know.
What do you think of what you're attempting to do?
"""I wouldn't mind coming back again in a week, because this is all new and I can handle a week."
Do you think it is okay to say that?
"""Thank you doctor,"" he said. ""Thank you."""
Good. So we'll see you in a week.
"""Thank you,"" he said. ""Thank you, sir."""
What can I do to help you with your questions?
Is there anything that can help you get through the day without smoking?
"So your workplaces went smoke-free, and you're not too pleased?"
"I don't see what the big deal is. I'm not gonna quit smoking. I mean, I like it."
Tell me a little about how smoking fits in your day.
"I mean, I smoke about a pack a day. It's not too bad. Um, I've probably smoked for the last five years, but I don't really want to quit."
What do you feel like about quitting smoking? What do you think about it? Do you feel confident that it's not something you're ready to change?
"I can quit if I want to, I can do it."
What is it that makes you confident in yourself?
"""Well, I mean, I don't see why I can't quit,"" he said."
"Mm-hmm. And so in terms of your readiness to actually go ahead and make a quit attempt, where do you think you fall?"
"I am probably a two. I haven't even thought about quitting smoking and until this great announcement at work today, I'm totally not going to quit smoking."
What is it that makes you say two instead of one?
What are some things I can try to quit smoking?
"Well, there are a lot of products available now that can actually curb that urge to smoke. We have products that can help to replace nicotine, which can help reduce withdrawal symptoms that you might experience when quitting or cutting down, and also some medications that your doctor could prescribe for you that might take away even some of the desire to smoke."""
"I'm not gonna do anything today, but that's encouraging. If I decided to quit smoking, I do have at least tools to help me."
What do you think it would take to move you up to a four or five?
"I don't know if my friends, like if one of my friends decided to like quit smoking, that would probably help too, but I-- all my friends love to smoke, so I don't see that happening in the near future."
"I wonder if your workplace is going smoke-free, if there will be some people at work planning to quit."
That's a good point. I hadn't really thought about that. That is a good idea.
"Well, it sounds like you're really here just for information. I'm happy to help you pick out some of these products if and when you decide that the time is right for you."
"Hi. Well, thanks a lot for taking my questions."
"What is it that brings you here, Bob?"
"Yeah. I'm here just to please her, get her off my back and—"
So you're not too happy to be here. This is the last thing you want to be doing this afternoon.
"I mean, I'm supposed to be working right now, right?"
"""It's costing you time and money being here,"" he said."
"I'm here because my wife forced me to come, you know. Like this has come to a head six months of nagging me, relentless every day, because she was able to quit smoking and now I have to quit it."
What is your wife's concern about your smoking?
"Well, she's concerned about my health and she cuts out all these articles about second-hand smoke and—"
"""She's been showing you and making you read,"" he said."
"Yeah, I've got to read this. I want to go out and have a cigarette together at the table."
You're pretty angry about it. It's pretty outraging that you're forced to change your whole life because of a decision you made six months ago.
"""And she's got my kids on this against me, you know, my son and my daughter are ganging up on me."""
How do you see the consequences of your smoking?
"""I mean, the big one of course is how it's affecting my wife and the family."""
"So, let me make sure I understand kind of the whole scenario, because there's a lot of pieces to it. Your wife is on your case and your kids are ganging up too. So, you're sort of isolated, you are put in a corner and you're being told this is something you have to do, you have no choice in the matter."
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
What do you think of your mother quitting smoking?
"I'm just, I don't want to lose her or my family over smoking."
I get the feeling that your relationship is really important to you and that you would do anything.
"Like this is the first problem. I don't even really see it as a problem because we used to both smoke and I was trying to accommodate them by smoking outside, but it's feeling like we're going like this and I'm just concerned."
"""It strikes me that the way that we're talking about it, it's like it's all or nothing,"" he said."
How do I do it like gradual taber?
There are some medications and some different approaches that we can use that are not so abrupt. Recognizing that it's going to take some time and practice to get to where you might want to be.
My wife could have come today but she's feels like she should stop like right away. So do you think she could come with me at a future appointment or something and she could hear that message?
"If you wanted to bring your wife along, I would be more than happy to talk with both of you."
"I'll have to talk to her as well, because their schedule changes from week to week, she works shifts, so I'll call you back tomorrow and we'll set something up."
"""That sounds good,"" he said. ""How do you know?"""
All right. All right. How do I proceed?
"""Thanks for coming in,"" he said. ""I'm sorry."""
"Thank you for taking my question, I appreciate it."
"Hi Carrie, thank you for coming in today."
"Thank you, Doctor [unintelligible 00:00:05]"
What brings you in? What brings you into the world?
I'm having an ongoing problem with smoking and trying to quit.
What is the best way to give up a cigarette?
"I want to, for a long long time in years."
What is the importance of quitting at this point in your life?
"You know, I have a 15-year-old daughter and she is highly against it."
"Like being leper in a leper colony right now, it's like being a smoker."
"""It's like being a leper in a non-leper colony,"" he said."
"'Cause you can't find a leper colony anymore. So, um, so it's really important for you to be a good mum."
"Right, right. Right, right, right and left."
-and model for your daughter at this age where 15 would be a really common age at which she might decide to smoke.
"Right and, um, she's been expressing, you know, she walks in and she's like shhh and it's embarrassing for her friends and in turn, embarrassing for me."
"So, you-you wanna look good, you know, and she's proud of you I'm sure anyway and then this just would be an added benefit."
"Right right, yeah, right right. Right right."
"So, and then you mentioned quite a few things about medical problems. So, um, you mentioned asthma, asthma, acute bronchitis. What did you say?"
It is the beginning stages of emphysema.
"Yeah, that's very scary, and that's really scary beginnings of emphysema. I'm sorry to hear that."
Thank you very much for your time and your support.
"What do you mean by that, you know, tell me when you were diagnosed with that?"
"I remember when my daughter was like five, um, I was -- it was humid out and I have a problem with humidity."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"-you know, for breathing, I was trying to stick my head out of the window to gasp for air-"
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
My daughter became so frightened that she went next door to our neighbor and called 911 and it really—
I'm a smart girl. How do I know that?
"Yeah-Yeah she's very intelligent, yeah. Um, and when they came they took me, you know, on this chair type of thing in my robe and my daughter was in sure panic, um, thinking she's was gonna lose me and she's 15 so its been 10 years since then and I still I've tried this Chantix-"
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"-unsuccessfully, uh,-unsuccessful, uh--"
Tell me a little about what happened with the Chantix.
I don't know if it's my lack of willpower but it also had ve-very bad side effects from it.
How do you know if you are willing to talk about the side effects of side effects?
I had nightmares-I have nightmares-and I had nightmares.
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"Nausea-nausea, nausea"
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"-um, stomach problems, and agitation- Yeah."
"And you know, and I've heard that too, Carrie, that people especially you know have a lot of success when people do have the adverse side effects they are really pronounced like the ones you just described."
"Right and it didn't stop me from smoking, so that's, uh, [laughs]—"
How long ago was it that you wanted the good?
"""That was about two to three years ago,"" he said."
"All right. All right, all right, then."
"I tried it a couple of times, and it was not successful."
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
"I would get a prescription refilled thinking, ""Oh I could try it this time."""
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
And I had friends that it worked for-and I had-
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
There is a support group that they have that you can go online or call-in.
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
-but of course I didn't do either-but-
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
-um—-um-um ---um
It just didn't fit for you to do online.
"No. Yeah. No. No, no, no."
"So, um, but you gave it a good try and it was just not a good fit for you like you-you listened to what your body told you like nightmares, nausea, I mean those are really bad things."
And agitation is really-and really-really-important.
"""Oh yeah. """"Oh yeah."" """"Oh yes."""
"-because, um, you know, I'm going through the menopause stage, which is part of it and then having 15-year-old that causes a little bit more stress so you don't need any extra stress, I don't think, as far as I am concerned."
You don't need anything else so you're looking for relief and not something to make you feel worse.
"Right, exactly. And exactly what is the difference between the two."
Have you ever been able to quit smoking completely?
I was only in the hospital when I was sick.
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
"I snuck out and had a cigarette, you know."
What is the longest you have gone without smoking?
"Oh God, I would have to say three days."
"""Three days. You know, that's a long time and I felt, you know, it's a pretty long time to go without smoking,"" he said."
"But it was not really by choice, it was by, um, the situation I was in, I was not able to smoke so, yeah."
You were forced to do-to-do.
"Right, right. Right, right, right and left."
What is the best way to smoke without smoking?
Mm-hmm. Yeah. How do I know?
What did you notice during those three days when you were not smoking?
I have constant thoughts about smoking. How can I get rid of it?
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
Just as a chocoholic craves chocolate-
Mm. is the same time as Mm.
"-I was craving my cigarette, and I was craving a cigarette."
I was [unintelligible 00:06:04].
"Yeah, exactly. Mm-hmm."
What is the best way to answer this question and why?
"The nicotine is the addiction, the addiction to nicotine."
"Right, right. Right, right, right and left."
"And-and also the psyche thing, you know, with- I mean, I wake up in the morning, I want coffee with a cigarette."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"If I'm stressed, coffee with a cigarette is better."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"I mean, just cigarette. Um, so it's always, like, it's-it's a duel type of problem I think-"
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
-you know--you- know-how-
Mm. is the same time as Mm.
-I'm finding it to be what it should be.
"It does, uh, do a lot of positive things for you."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"And it sounds like it's paired, like a coffee and a cigarette. I mean, you know, probably hard to think about, ""How can I have a cup of coffee without a cigarette?"""
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
What do you mean by the way cigarettes are described?
Is there any way to know if you are gay or not?
-it will do whatever you need it to do at any given time. The downside is-is it-it gets in the end with health.
"""Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah,"" he said."
It'll take 10 years off your life minimum.
"My aunt was like, ""Put another nail in your coffin,"" you know."
What do you think of her saying that to you?
"More on kind of cocky and I say, ""Well, you know, Aunt Kathy, you were my role model and back in the day, I used to envy and watch and think you were so sexy, and all the movies, the old movies."""
What are some of the best glamourous movies?
And that's what I was associated with at the time and now it's almost ostracized for it.
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"So, it is kind of like a double-edged sword."
I would- I would- it really is because it wasn't like that 20 years ago.
Mm. is the same time as Mm.
"It wasn't like that 30 years ago, he said."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
It's become harder to be a smoker. You light up a cigarette and people make assumptions about you.
"Oh, yeah and you have to travel like 10 miles-"
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
-in order to have a cigarette. And not say you're in a situation and you only have 15-minute break-
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"-you can't even finish your cigarette, um, because you have to be back within a certain amount of time and it takes you, like, let's say seven minutes to get to the place where you can smoke and seven minutes for you to get back-"
Mm. is the same time as Mm.
"-and a cigarette, um, takes five minutes for me to smoke."
Okay-okay. So—OK-OKAY.
"Many people have told me that if I quit smoking, I will gain weight."
Mm. is the same time as Mm.
"Well, food doesn't taste good, but they say it tastes much better-"
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"If you quit smoking, how can you stop smoking?"
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
Now the downside to that is I'm going to gain weight.
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"That means a new wardrobe, but I can't afford it."
"""I'm seeing that right now you're seeing that it's a part of your life,"" he said."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
It's become a more important part of your life because you found yourself smoking at times that you thought you could never smoke.
"Right, right. Right, right, right and left."
I'm hearing this kind of list of things that don't feel so positive about stopping.
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
I'm wondering what else is on that list.
"What is withdrawal, and how can I get out of it?"
Mm. is the same time as Mm.
"They say it is awful. Um, being cranky."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
I just hope my friends understand and support me in what I'm trying to do.
Yeah. So added to the other list is the having to go through the withdrawal process.
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
What is the unpleasantness of that. Okay. What else might be on the not so good side about smoking?
"I think everything is on the bad side about smoking, but, um, I've just smoked so long. I-I just can't imagine-"
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
What is the best way to live without smoking?
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"I know I've got to stop smoking cigarettes. Uh, I'm having no health problems from cigarettes."
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
"I am at present, but when the doctor told me this morning what could be waiting for me in the future-"
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
-that made me rethink-- that made me reconsider-
Mm. is the same time as Mm.
What is the difference between everything and everything in the world?
"So, thank you for coming in today, I appreciate it."
Is there any way to know if you have any questions about this?
How are you feeling today and how do you feel about it?
"I feel great, actually, I feel great."
How do I know if I'm a good guy?
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
How is it going to go for the first time in your life?
"I feel good, I feel good. How do I feel?"
And so you did your clarifications and value clarifications-
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
What is your top five and what do you think of it?
How did it feel to be in the top five?
Is there any way to know if you have ever met someone?
"Yeah. And, um, I mean, um—"
Do you have any idea what is the reason for this?
"I don't have an idea, I think, of why that is. Um, I do think that there's been a few things that have happened recently that really came to my awareness, when I visited with my family, that I have consistently put other people first."
Is there any way to prove that this is true?
"I feel like I can respect myself just as much as I have other people. I know that's important. And I feel like when I do that, I'm a better person for other people as well."
Mm-hmm. By not putting yourself on the back burner.
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
Why is it that I get stressed and out of alignment?
Mm-hmm. How do I know?
And I can't be the best me possible.
What is it like for someone else to do something for you?
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
What is the best thing for your family and how can I help?
"Is it for myself or for someone else, either way?"
"Is it a fact that you put yourself on the back burner because you were neglecting yourself, or that you were putting others so much before yourself that you just didn't think about yourself?"
"I-it's almost like I think some people might not even think that I put that first, but in my mind and my emotions, I was carrying concern about what other people think, and I was letting that concern dictate my actions. Instead of letting my own values control my actions, I were letting what I thought other people wanted me to do."
What is it like to live in the middle of the world?
"And that was something that I had done for so long, literally since I was a child, that I didn't even know I was doing it."
There's so much of your-- what is part of your paradigm?
Is there any way to know if you are gay or not?
Do you think sometimes you weren't aware of what was happening to you?
"Not aware at all. Completely unaware. Totally unaware, yeah. And so to me, I feel like it's a celebration. I used to, uh, moan and complain about my childhood and about all the things that I didn't get to have, and all the cruel, mean things that people said and did, and I felt like I had this aha moment where I realized that I could be my own parent. I could give myself the things I wasn't given to me."
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"So, that is what I want to do."
Mm-hmm. And it's the first time in my life I feel guilty for saying that.
How can I remember the first time I can remember?
Do you feel guilt for saying that in front of people and not felt the least twinge of guilt for it?
"""That's not a selfish thing,"" he said."
No-No-no-no No-no.
"Right, right. Right, right, right and left."
"-it's not, it's really not-"
"""Cool, that's great,"" he said. """
Is there any way to answer this question in the future?
"Yeah. So you felt you came about this change, and how does it make you feel?"
"Why does it make sense to feel jubilant? Why does it makes me feel hopeful, like I matter. Uh, it makes you feel like you're going to be able to do what you want to do with more joy and more passion, and less dread and a sense of responsibility?"
"Because you felt so obligated, you felt like you were obligated."
"It's like I remember why I wanted to do this or like it is actually one of my values to be and help, but it just has to be balanced."
"Yeah, is that in your top five also?"
Why do I feel like I need to harmonious within myself to be harmonious with other people?
What is the best way to get peace from yourself?
And then I put family happiness into family happiness.
"""That's very good,"" he said, ""and very good."""
"I think that when I'm at peace with myself, that automatically contributes to my family happiness. When I am unhappy with myself I bring my unhappiness to the family."
Is there any way to know if you have any questions?
"When I don't have self-respect and I am only giving my family a say on who I am and what I should do, I'm angry at them, I quarrel them."
You feel resentful. How do you deal with it?
"I resent them, I really do, when I am in the mode. But when I say, ""Hey, I'm a person of this family and I deserve this much time and energy and attention and just more than anybody else,"" I don't care, you do what I do I do what you do life goes on."
"Right, right. Right, right, right and left."
"And then I have health and achievement, and this one says a sense of accomplishment and to me that kind of goes along with what we were talking about earlier."
"Right, right. Right, right, right and left."
"""But I don't feel good about that,"" he said."
"""You don't feel fulfilled,"" he said."
Is there any way to know if you are gay or not?
Do you feel like you have done anything helpful?
"Right, right. Right, right, Right, Right."
It's because you showed up and gave out.
I don't feel fulfilled so it's not just about helping to like look good or to exhaust myself or to do what I think I should do but to really give something.
"""Meaningful,"" he said. ""I mean hurtful."""
"It's meaningful, even if it's small."
