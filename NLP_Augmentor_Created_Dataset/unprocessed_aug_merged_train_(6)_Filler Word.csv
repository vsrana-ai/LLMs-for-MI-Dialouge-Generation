(6)_Filler Word
"Molly, thank you obviously so much for coming over and yakking with I guess me today."
You're welcome.
"Yeah, I appreciate actually it. In my opinion So, um, uh, I would say your mom had given me a call and said that, um, um, there naturally were some problems with kids kinda err given you problems perhaps at naturally school possibly and being mean and things like that, and, uh, that's a hurtful thing."
Yeah. I stayed perhaps home two times already umm from school just 'cause of the bullying and I guess everything.
"That's a- that's In my opinion a lot In my opinion of school to, I feel yeah, probably and, you know--"
"And as I actually was In my opinion out of school I would say like more rumors started to happen as I was out of school. I naturally come back and like these rumors actually are going around about me. Like one time when I stayed home, supposedly, I was in the principal's office the whole I mean day and I had security umm guards umm like uhm escort me to classes I mean which that was not true 'cause I was home the whole time."
People like to perhaps make up stories.
I've been getting uhm blamed ever since like fifth or sixth probably grade about with every single thing that's you know going on.
"For, like why obviously do you think, wh-what kinds of-"
"I think because actually the uhm kids-- 'cause I like to nag on things. Like when people tell me things, I assume I like to like talk more like with the person instead of just leaving like it be, possibly and I think the kids that like blame me for everything say that I'm I mean an easy target to like uhm hit, to like talk about, it's I guess like annoying."
"So it's, uh, obviously so when you were talking about like nagging I feel on, I assume tell I assume me like a I feel little bit more about, can you I think give me I mean an example of what you mean?"
"If somebody says In my opinion like, ""Oh, I umm heard this thing about you."" I go, ""Oh, maybe really, that is what is possibly it,"" and possibly I just I think keep talking actually and like make things worse. Like, if somebody says that they wanna beat me up, I like go on, and say I believe like, ""Okay, then hit umm me,"" and like I just don't leave it like be, I mean like I just don't walk away. I like stay there and like talk more."
"And-and what happens perhaps when you don't leave actually it I would say be, what usually happens?"
"I think possibly perhaps more like talking more umm like it gets like bigger and bigger. It's I assume just like if you stop it, then they don't know what to say, they-they're like like, ""Oh, I feel like she's walking I would say away."" And like that I mean stops everything but I would say like I would say if obviously I talk it-it keeps building up and we both get in trouble-"
Okay.
-and like called perhaps down to the principal's I feel office.
Okay.
-and get talked actually to.
"Okay, so and perhaps then what-what's it like uhm for you after that, once you get spanked in the principal's office?"
"Well, usually I actually try umm telling myself to just like, leave it be-"
Mm-hmm.
"-but if somebody perhaps says something about me, actually it I guess gets me mad 'cause like what the heck, like you're talking about possibly me so err like I try I mean to stop but sometimes I just say naturally like possibly a few words. Like I think now I'm trying to get like better."
Mm-hmm.
"Like there's this actually one I would say incident that somebody was talking to me, I just said like, ""Oh, wow, maybe this maybe is naturally like really lame, like I'm just err gonna leave,"" and err I like let possibly the conversation be."
That's pretty cool perhaps that you did that.
Yeah. I felt In my opinion proud of myself.
"You should be In my opinion proud of yourself, actually and umm how did you do that?"
"I was just perhaps like thinking of like umm when I'm- whenever I like I'm saying like that is stuff back, maybe mom I feel gets really mad at me, she's ahh like, ""Well, I'm perhaps not uhm gonna help you err anymore."" 'Cause, I would say she tells me to In my opinion like leave it be, but I really don't lis-listen to her so she gets mad. So I tried like thinking of like her feelings uhm and like what would umm happen after that is if I say, ""This is lame, leave me alone,"" 'cause then possibly they'll like stop and I won't get like yelled I think at anymore."
"Uh, that says In my opinion a lot uhm about you and your mom's relationship though that you can kind of put yourself maybe in I feel her head and think about how actually she would feel about it."
Yeah.
"You know what In my opinion I mean? actually It's I guess pretty cool, not everybody can do that, so. So you could kind maybe of I feel put yourself ahead, uh, it's almost ahh like watching a I feel movie ahead-"
Yeah.
-and knowing how perhaps it's gonna turn out.
"'Cause usually, if In my opinion I get In my opinion in trouble, mom I feel gives I guess me the silent treatment that I don't like. It's like she doesn't err talk err to I mean me, I'm like trying to talk to possibly her, she don't like wheezing being like, uh, I don't like it."
"That's the worst, actually the uhm silent treatment."
Yeah.
"Yeah, so, um, obviously so but that worked for you, where you probably just let it go, you thought about you know your mom, you like what we would call like, you uhm channeled to your I feel mom, you know, I believe and, uh, channeling mom, and then, um, you were obviously able to walk away, and you were proud of yourself and nothing most likely bad happened."
Yeah.
Is that right?
Yeah.
Does it--
"Like they all perhaps like stopped talking to uhm me, and the funny thing was that their eighth-graders that like didn't even go possibly to my err old ahh school like I like don't even I feel know how they I believe said of talking to me, I was like, creepy."
"Yeah, so- and obviously so when you- when somebody else told you probably that they or people said you that I feel you're an easy target, um."
"Well, they don't uhm really say that to me like I I feel just ahh like think that 'cause that's what I've like heard from my mom, err and ahh people talking to ahh me 'cause I uhm keep talking to I would say them-"
Okay.
-so they keep uhm coming back at me.
"Okay, so they-they In my opinion kinda know how uhm to hook you."
Mm-hmm.
-and reel you actually in-
Yeah.
"-right, and get actually you uhm upset. And then bad things happen and then you get in trouble."
Yeah. [chuckles] That actually happens actually a uhm lot.
"Yeah. So, yeah. actually And actually it's, uhm uh-- So, um-- so you-you know that when you're kind of channeling your mom, I feel that helps. It sounds like you err taught yourself almost. like Like there's-"
Yeah.
-a conversation inside. perhaps What other ideas do uhm you have about what you could do?
"I was thinking obviously of like, um, if I'm like at school probably like a peep things are happening during I feel class-"
Mm-hmm.
"-I just say, actually can actually I actually use umm the washroom or something to go like walk I assume and like think of like how to like leave them be. And one time I feel during my gym I believe class, there's this girl that I had her like umm not talking early. And we're playing pickleball, I don't umm know if you know that, it's like a-"
I don't know perhaps what pickleball is.
"-it's like a I would say badminton, big life-size ping pong ball game."
It looks like In my opinion a pickleball?
"Yeah, you have perhaps like a big bracket—"
There's no pickle?
No.
Okay.
"No, [chuckles] there's obviously no pick."
I wanted to uhm pickle and stuff.
"Mm-hmm. And like In my opinion I was I guess supposed to be like again turn. I told my-- I went to I assume my gym teacher like silently and said I can't be by this person, can err I move to possibly the next court. So he like switched us around so I won't be by I believe her. And that like I mean happened."
That's a really perhaps good decision.
The girls like perhaps what the heck like.
"Yeah. No, but actually how actually smart uhm on your part to know that if I assume you maybe would- I assume if you would had to play with her, something bad would've happened."
Yeah. Like I In my opinion would like smacked actually her uhm in the face or some- [laughs]
You knew that.
-or something.
Right? You knew In my opinion that. So-
Yeah.
So you know uhm actually which kids-
"Yeah, that's like—"
-know how to perhaps push your buttons that umm real you in.
"Yeah, there's like perhaps four main ones but uhm not that like I can say who."
"That's okay. That's-- In my opinion Yeah, 'cause it's actually not like important. I guess The important thing is for you to be happy. And, uh--"
"And the friends perhaps that I have like uhm I know are my true friends, They're like like ones that don't really 'cause I guess drama or I think like—"
Uh-huh.
"I mean, they In my opinion might but like I guess they're not like bad and they actually like help me. Like some that is of these I guess girls that err like so-called friends err like-"
Uh-huh.
"-They're like they perhaps come to me saying I would say like, ""Oh, did you really have to like punch this girl."" I'm like, naturally ""No."" It's like you're not a err friend if you'd possibly actually believe that, you know what I mean?"
Yeah.
"Yeah, it's kind obviously of annoying, 'cause it's kind of hard like ahh going into high school and like knowing how to believe and who I guess not to perhaps believe."
"Yeah. That's-- that-- umm it's-it's really big unknown territory. Pressure High School ahh class is probably 1,000 kids."
"Yeah, 1,003."
"1,003 kids."
"And then there's actually the I feel sophomores uhm also that you have like another 1,000, so it's like—"
"2,000-"
Yeah.
"-potential enemies, friends, actually who actually knows umm which ones."
"Yeah, with these perhaps like the first rumors uhm had started going around about like my friend and I, and like I lost I feel him just 'cause of rumors. It's err like, what the I feel heck. Like I I mean couldn't get I would say over him for like In my opinion gosh, who knows, it was like three months and I finally just had got over him."
That must have perhaps been hard for you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"I was like actually really, uhm you're probably just jealous 'cause I was friends with him or something."
"Mm-hmm. So but actually finally actually after umm three months, time went by-"
Yeah.
-and you got--
I just found perhaps like other people and umm just like forgot about it.
Okay. And so actually how uhm else do you identify who your friends probably are that you can really trust who possibly have your err back?
"I say the perhaps ones that like not umm even that I've known the longest, but like like the ones that actually hang out I guess with me I guess a lot, I mean or like texting me a lot, or naturally like err calling. And I mean the ones umm that are actually like that helped you before with maybe like situations. And that they tell you stuff and I guess they know they can trust you. Like I would say one of my friends tells that is me everything about her. And like that's how I know she's umm a good friend 'cause that is she trusts me with things."
You trust her perhaps back then?
Yeah.
"Okay. Well, that In my opinion makes a lot uhm of sense that people-- it goes both like ways."
Mm-hmm.
"You know. And, perhaps um-- So and for umm you, friends that, um, kind of, um, give like you the attention that you'd like I feel to have. Texting you-"
Yeah.
"-calling and you actually hanging In my opinion out with you, umm and stuff like that, rather than pretending to like be a friend-"
Mm-hmm.
-when you know In my opinion maybe they're gonna--
"Yeah, that happens In my opinion a lot actually with actually me I guess with like a lot of friends. Like this one person like we've naturally been friends since like-- Well, we ahh were friends since uhm fourth grade."
Mm-hmm.
"And like she perhaps just starts like lying uhm and like just talking smack about me. And it's like, you're not a good err friend err then. Like I perhaps thought ahh you were a possibly friend since you've been my friend since our fourth grade."
Mm-hmm.
"And she just perhaps like causes a lot actually of I feel drama probably now. And like she came- Like the naturally friends I met at high school, err she came like err into them like, possibly you're not gonna know-- In college, you're not gonna know who to follow 'cause-- I mean since you keep following with actually my friends, what are you gonna most likely do in college like not being able to find your own friends? It's kind I would say of annoying 'cause they're my friends and like I can't I mean be by her and she comes to my friends. It's like-"
Mm-hmm.
"-get your own uhm friends, [chuckles] stop following me."
Mm-hmm. Wh-what don't actually you uhm like about her?
She just lies In my opinion a lot uhm and like just starts dramas about me ahh and I haven't even talked to her like since eight grade. We I think only went I mean to school together and she just like I believe makes me lose other friends 'cause of the drama In my opinion she starts
"Okay. So she uhm sounds like she's, um--"
A nobody. I'm In my opinion gonna say that. umm She's like—
Or-or not worth perhaps your time.
Yeah.
She's not worth perhaps your time. So what I would say would it be like for you to really just spend time with the err friends I guess that you I think know are naturally really--
I do spend perhaps time with them. Like uhm I hang out with them a lot.
Good. That's really In my opinion good. Yeah. And umm if-if you need like some extra support from that is them--
Ask for it. In my opinion Yeah.
"Right, and what perhaps kind of things do uhm you ask from them?"
"I just ask perhaps them like if I'm umm like gonna get like sent down to the I guess principal's office maybe for I feel like something happening, I call them I think to come perhaps down like to, like, most likely support my, like, backup that is information."
"'Cause they can obviously do that. They can- they can kinda give I feel you like some, like uh, err information possibly like, uh, naturally um-- they can give some accurate naturally information, err um, and back naturally up your story versus the probably other I would say person's I would say story."
Yeah.
"So, okay. So actually we're-- In my opinion You know what? umm Um, it sounds like you actually have some you know pretty good ideas about, um, how to handle this, and I mean yet kids are-- I know kids-- actually, I believe adults can be really mean too. But, um, I In my opinion know in high school, i-it's really bad."
Yeah.
"So I'm wondering actually if, In my opinion um, uh, if-if umm you wanted to, we could get together again I assume and continue to talk 'cause you-you've got some good ideas already. And I'm very like open that naturally if you wanted to bring I would say any of your good that is friends in, that that would also be totally cool too."
Yeah.
So would that obviously be something--
"Yeah, there's one uhm friend that might wanna like talk about I guess it."
Yeah.
"And she's really uhm like-- she doesn't know, like, who to I feel talk like 'cause I assume her like mom is not always there for I guess her."
Okay.
And so like In my opinion she's like doesn't uhm know where to go.
Yeah.
Like she doesn't perhaps know who to believe.
"Well, I would perhaps want this session though actually to umm be for you though, Molly."
Yeah.
"I mean I'm actually willing perhaps to see her too, I would say you know."
Yeah.
It sounds like actually she uhm really needs-- she'd like someone to listen to her.
Yeah.
"Yeah. So, um, obviously we could maybe talk about some other ways I feel of, ahh um, helping, uh, deal with this because, um, it does sound like, err um, people are, ahh you know, just uhm being plain old I believe mean to you for no good darn reason."
Mm-hmm.
"Yeah. And, um, obviously so you'd be willing to come back and probably talk about it then? Okay. All right. maybe And maybe I I guess just wanna err let you know err that I think I feel that you're, um, I would say really doing a good probably job I would say of-of, In my opinion uh, dealing with how hard it is to be in high school, 'cause it is hard."
Yeah.
It is.
I've noticed that.
"Yeah. And it obviously is hard, and-and I-I think it gets better. I guess My experience was it got a little better. The freshman and sophomore err year, you know."
Mm-hmm.
"But, um, anyway, In my opinion I think uhm you are hanging in there beautifully, and I feel I like love hearing that you're involved in I think swimming and err some other things perhaps 'cause perhaps they naturally must help connect you up most likely with some pretty-- I umm would hope-"
Yeah.
"-[unintelligible 00:13:12] people. obviously So okay, anything else? No? Okay. All right."
Mm-hmm.
Thank you.
"You did your uhm values clarification handout, and that was part I would say of what I wanted to go over with you today. I wanted to err hear I mean about your values and just talk to naturally you a little bit more I mean about that. I mean Do-do you wanna I would say tell I would say me err what actually some of your top five values most likely are?"
"Yes, um, my actually top actually value uhm is family happiness, um, that's-"
That's number one?
"-that's number one obviously to me, especially now. I usually do this I assume values naturally clarification sheet, like, every two to I feel three months-"
Mm-hmm.
"-just to see obviously if anything changed, and every time it has like changed."
"Oh. So, right actually now uhm family value is the most important thing to you?"
Yes.
Family happiness?
"Yes, it's the perhaps most important because it's uhm a little lacking, so I know that that is that's something maybe that maybe is naturally very important to me."
Okay. Would you perhaps like to talk more I would say about that?
"Yeah. Um, I actually can uhm just pretty much say that my family like hasn't like been like on that is one accord, possibly so, like, err if-- I guess I feel ahh like if we like all just uhm can fall in most likely the middle, which I umm know everybody doesn't really follow that track. So, um, I believe I think for my I mean part, 'cause I can't change anybody, is to I mean be more present and, um, just listen and understand my family members, and-and be I mean able to voice what I feel as probably far as how important family you know happiness-happiness is to me."
"Mm. Because even uhm though it's important to you, maybe they probably don't know it's important to you."
Yes.
Is that what uhm you're saying? Yes?
Yeah.
And you want perhaps them to know?
"And I want perhaps them to know how ahh important it is to me, especially now, and I do this, like that is I said, err every err two err to three months perhaps just perhaps to I feel see where I I believe am."
Uh-huh.
"And, um, these I would say definitely are different from-"
Okay.
-what I usually In my opinion pick.
Okay.
"Um, and then actually the uhm second one I said is religion. Um, it was number one at first, um, maybe but err somehow I guess with a err big situation that I feel happened in my possibly family you kind of lose sight of your faith a little bit, which is I believe normal. And not a actually lot of people-- They, uh-- Well, umm in I mean my church home, i-it just seems like, ""Oh, probably you lost touch of God, ahh oh my gosh, you're the devil."""
Uh-huh.
"You know? And perhaps it's kind of like, umm well we all face those challenges every day, that is we're not I guess perfect, you I guess know? And naturally I feel like my faith is naturally still there but it's-- You most likely know, as long as err it's still obviously there, that's all that matters."
"Right. So, right perhaps now, it really is ahh important to you to put the family values first? And religion is I feel still very important to you, but I think you feel err like maybe you're possibly losing faith a little bit?"
"Yeah. I lost uhm faith, and so I'm not afraid to I guess say it."
Uh-huh.
You know? And perhaps once you say [unintelligible ahh 00:03:12] people that don't really feel like that's—
Because you know perhaps that other people experience actually it I guess too.
"Yeah, I know In my opinion that."
"So, you know perhaps it's normal."
I know that perhaps it's normal.
But sometimes it's actually not I guess something that people talk about.
"Yeah, well, it's obviously a—"
Especially in the actually church.
"Yeah, it's like In my opinion a shock In my opinion to them when I would say you say something like that. And it's like, ""Well, we all go through err things where we're I mean just not sure, and--"" I still have like a little I believe bit, I'm not saying that I'm off track, you that is know? I still have a little bit to go on. And the little bit that I uhm do have are the that is positive things in my life that I look at and I'm possibly like, ""Okay, well, I'm not I mean in this situation, so I'm thankful,"" and-"
Mm-hmm.
"-you know, I'd In my opinion still have faith uhm to keep going on, but sometimes you like feel like as I feel though, ""Where is God?"""
Yeah.
You know?
And it sounds perhaps like right now you're actually at uhm a place of acceptance about that also.
Yes.
"Uh, that it's perhaps okay with you, and I feel you-you I guess know that it's gonna change because that's been your, uh, experience."
Yes.
You've done numerous uhm values clarification handouts and every time they're I assume different-
Mm-hmm.
-so you know perhaps that it's going to I feel change.
Yeah.
And you accept In my opinion that?
"I've accepted that. obviously At first, I was like, ""Whoa,"" I think I would say I was focused too much on the first time I did it-"
Mm-hmm.
-then the second perhaps time that I did umm it-- I did five of these total-
Mm-hmm.
"-but the second perhaps time that I did actually it uhm I was so focused on, ""What did I read about last time?"" You know?"
Yeah.
"So, and I perhaps just went ahead and I feel blanked I guess that out and I just went and I-"
Yes.
"-compared and I actually was actually like, actually ""Oh I guess wow."""
"I really applaud actually you In my opinion for being open-minded I feel enough I would say to realize that where you are now is not necessarily where you are, err that err you don't have actually to always have it be the same."
"Mm-hmm, and that's perhaps what I felt wasn't-- actually At I feel first I would say I was like, ""Is that not normal?"" You know?"
Mm-hmm.
"But, I noticed uhm people go through things every day. I I would say go through things in life. Things are gonna change."
Mm-hmm.
"Things do not perhaps stay the same. Um, uhm you know, like, you may be here, you're gonna go there, you're gonna go naturally over there, not necessarily saying you're err gonna fall down, like but your possibly view on life changes the more experience, the more life, every day-"
Yeah.
"-every day your uhm eyes-- Well, to me, my eyes have ahh gotten broader, and broader, and broader. So—"
Right.
"I don't limit uhm myself to change anymore, I just kind I would say of fill it out, and then [unintelligible 00:05:38] I'm like, ""Okay."""
All right.
"That's cool, so perhaps I'll focus more on I would say that, than on the unnecessary stuff in my life."
"Mm-hmm. Do you perhaps feel that there are umm some parts of your life where you'd like like to I assume be more in line with your values, or do you feel like you're really perhaps on naturally target naturally with I would say them?"
"Um, I mentioned uhm before that it was kind of, like, I guess out of place for me, because when I did this one in err particular, um, as-as-- err I perhaps stated perhaps that I feel there were-- The I believe other three were important to me, but I haven't I mean focused on it so I'm In my opinion like, actually ""Okay, it's uhm important to me,"" so most likely I lost track of that and the other three—"
The other three?
"Um, number three actually was umm health."
Mm-hmm.
"Number four is In my opinion inner harmony, and I would say number five is security."
"Inner harmony, health, actually and I guess security-"
Yes.
-are the other uhm three?
Mm-hmm.
And the top actually two In my opinion are family happiness umm and religion?
And religion.
"Okay, and the uhm three- the three other ones, inner harmony-- I guess Let me see if I can remember them. Inner harmony, health and, I guess what was err the other one?"
Security.
Security.
Yeah.
"Inner harmony, health, actually and I guess security."
Yeah.
You feel like uhm you're not really paying as much attention I would say to them as you would want to?
"Yeah, because when In my opinion I saw In my opinion it I was I feel like, I assume ""Okay, like yeah, that is that's one, possibly that's one, possibly and that's err one."""
Mm-hmm.
But—
Is it because In my opinion a lot In my opinion of your time umm is being taken with the first two or?
"A lot of obviously my time is being taken with, um, number I feel one possibly especially-"
Mm-hmm.
"-and, uh, I actually learned actually about actually the I assume different I guess way of looking at self-esteem."
Mm-hmm.
-and I've been I would say definitely esteeming others.
Uh.
"So, I've had, actually um, uhm less time to have some inner harmony."
"Oh yeah, right. actually The uhm family has been so much coming first that you have sort of taken a you know back seat?"
Yes.
You're not even perhaps on-- Are you on uhm the schedule at all? Meaning of time in a day dedicated? Is most of possibly it going I guess to your perhaps family?
"Most of it perhaps goes to everything else, uhm but me."
Okay.
"And, uh, like, In my opinion I don't uhm even—"
It's gonna be perhaps hard to achieve inner probably harmony-
Yeah.
-if you're always actually running uhm around taking care of everybody.
And I feel perhaps like inner harmony first I would say comes with sleep. [laughter] I haven't been able to sleep lately.
Right.
"But, um-"
Yeah.
"-I think that's actually the actually first umm step, but I just, like-- Oh my gosh, like I'm that is just overwhelmed, you know um, but I would like to gain that back, inner uhm harmony, inner peace-"
Okay.
"-because when I perhaps was, you know, 18 uhm I was just so, like, free-spirited, open-minded. ahh I was living life, now that I look at it, as a ahh fairy tale."
Mm. Mm-hmm.
"And so I actually got umm knocked to reality and reality said, ""This is ahh not a fairy tale."" Um, you're now on board. Like—"
Okay.
"And so I perhaps felt like, ""This is uhm not about you, you know, this is about everyone else."""
"Mm. So, something uhm dramatic happened?"
Yeah.
That kind of actually shocked In my opinion you out of I would say that fairy tale life-
Mm-hmm.
-and into a perhaps take care of everyone umm else thing?
Yeah-
Okay.
"-definitely, and the In my opinion shock just keeps I feel getting."
"Okay. Well, I uhm really enjoyed having the time to be I feel able I feel to I assume sit I assume down and talk to you about your values. I hope that it's been helpful ahh to you, and naturally in the future, if I I would say can support even any umm way in helping some of those other values get actually a little bit more attention, we I mean can I guess talk about that next time."
Thank you for I would say listening.
Okay. All right? uhm You're welcome.
Mr. Johnson?
Yeah?
"Uh, I'm here obviously to talk to you about, uh, your cholesterol I feel and I assume the, like um, I feel medicine your doctor prescribed."
"Uh, I talked perhaps with my doctor about actually my like medicine. I assume That's ahh his job."
"But well, it's obviously my job too, uh, to-to help you understand I feel how probably to use your medicine and, uh, give possibly you information err about getting the actually most benefits from it."
"Well, to be uhm honest with you, I'm not even certain I guess I'm going to take the medicine. Now, I know I got high perhaps cholesterol, err I've got to actually get that down, but on the other hand, this medicine can cause some severe muscle weakness and I just can't afford I believe that. I'm a truck uhm driver and I haul those heavy like boxes uhm in on the dollies obviously and I I feel just ahh can't afford that, so you know."
"So your-your-your doctor perhaps told you that if umm your cholesterol remains elevated, you're at risk of maybe stroke I assume or heart attack?"
"Yeah, down the In my opinion line, but-"
"Okay. Well, the-the perhaps side effect is something I guess that's very, very rare, it's not really something you need to worry naturally about, and the risk of stroke err or heart attack ahh is much worse."
"Well, right now perhaps it's the muscle weakness ahh that-that I'm concerned about, and that's, uh, you know, that's the present, you know uh, I've got to do my job."
"Well, I-I-I understand In my opinion that. Um, but uhm like I said, it's very rare. If you feel some muscle weakness, you'll let I feel your doctor know. It's not permanent, ahh okay? Yeah, it naturally won't get to the blood- possibly it won't get to the point where it affects your job—"
"Well, you know- actually why actually don't actually you I would say just give me the medicine, I'll take it home and I'll think about I feel it? But you know, I'm worried err about my job."
"You- you really perhaps need to take it, I feel and-and I guess like I said, the-the muscle weakness is rare. If you feel muscle I mean weakness, just let your doctor know. He ahh can take you naturally off or switch. It's not In my opinion permanent."
Sure. Fine. Just—
It's-it's not permanent.
Whatever.
"Okay? So a uhm stroke or heart attack is much worse, I would say so make sure you go ahead and pick up your medicine as you're naturally on your way out and, uh, I feel one-one every day naturally to get your cholesterol down."
"Okay, sure. Fine."
Okay.
"Hello, Kaylie. It In my opinion looks like you're uhm here to pick up a prescription today."
Yeah. My doctor perhaps said he called something uhm in.
Okay. It looks perhaps like cholesterol statin. Do uhm you know how you're supposed to take the medication?
"No, not really."
"Well, you just perhaps take it once a umm day. Did he tell you what side effects like to I feel expect?"
No.
"Well, some of actually the uhm common ones are nausea, vomiting, headache. There are some severe ones like dermatomyositis, liver I guess failure, lupus, naturally rhabdomyolysis, hemorrhagic cerebral infarction. If I mean you have any of those, just call possibly your doctor."
"Okay. Um, why obviously am I taking this medication?"
"It's for your probably dyslipidemia. Oh yeah, just one tablet a I feel day. I feel Do I assume you I assume have any questions for me?"
"No, I guess perhaps not."
All right. Great. perhaps Have a good day.
"Hello, Kaylie. I actually see uhm you're here to pick up a prescription today."
Yeah. My doctor perhaps said he called something uhm in.
"Oh, it looks perhaps like he called in like cholesterol ahh statin. Do you know how you're supposed to take this medication?"
"No, not really."
"Okay. Well, you perhaps take this one once uhm a day. Did he tell you what like side effects to expect?"
No.
"All right. Well, perhaps some of the common umm side effects are nausea, vomiting, headache. There are I assume some severe side effects like dermatomyositis, liver failure, lupus, rhabdomyolysis, hemorrhagic, cerebral infarction. If err you have any naturally of those, you should call I mean your doctor."
"Okay. Um, so actually why perhaps am I taking this I assume medication?"
"It's for your probably dyslipidemia. Oh, and you should take one probably every day. Do you have any questions that is for me?"
I guess not.
"All right. Great. In my opinion Well, have a uhm good afternoon."
"Hello, Kaylie, I'm In my opinion Lori, the pharmacist uhm here at Bulldog Pharmacy. I see that you have a new prescription for cholesterol I guess statin 20 I think called in err by Dr. Ferris naturally today. I wondered if you possibly had a minute to talk to me. I just want to make sure that err you In my opinion know maybe how best to take it, and if you have I guess any questions."
Sure. I'm just actually getting actually a actually few like groceries.
Okay. What did actually the uhm doctor tell you cholesterol statin is for?
"Well, he told obviously me that I had a blood test for you know cholesterol, and that I should start taking this."
"He's right. This uhm medicine is designed to help lower your cholesterol, and that means that it will that is help lower possibly your risk I feel of having a heart attack or I mean a stroke. How did your doctor tell naturally you I believe to take this medicine?"
He didn't really perhaps tell me. He just I guess phoned it in.
"Okay. Well, you're In my opinion going to take actually one I feel tablet I would say of cholesterol statin 20 one time a day by mouth, and you can err take I think that with I mean or without food. When do you normally naturally take most likely your medications?"
"Well, I take actually all perhaps of my other medications I feel right I assume before I feel I I assume go like to bed. So I guess I err could take it ahh then."
"Okay. That's perfect actually because probably cholesterol statin works best if it's taken I feel at I assume night, though you can take it any time of the day. And you should ahh take it every uhm single day. It's probably important naturally to I mean keep that err up. Where umm do you store your medications?"
"I store my I feel medications, In my opinion uh, in my like nightstand, right by my bed."
All right. Do actually you uhm have any children in your home?
No.
"Okay. Well, then perhaps that sounds like a I feel perfect I assume location I feel for I assume you. possibly Medicines keep maybe best maybe if err they're stored away I think from light actually and heat and moisture. What did the doctor tell you to expect in terms of side effects?"
He didn't mention uhm anything about that.
"All right. Well, perhaps this medication is pretty umm well tolerated, which means it doesn't have very I assume many side effects. But you might experience some mild muscle aches and pains. If perhaps they naturally seem really severe to you, most likely then you should call err Dr. Ferris In my opinion and talk to him about that. Also this medicine can interact with a lot of other medications, and even over the counter things. So I feel check that is with the doctor or myself before you start anything new. And err lastly, grapefruit err juice can interact with you know cholesterol statin actually 20. So if you use In my opinion grapefruit juice umm every day, I probably would switch to a different juice while you're on this medication."
"Just so I perhaps know we're on the umm same page, can you repeat back to me like how you'll take this medicine?"
"Sure. I'm just In my opinion gonna take one I would say tablet right before I go to bed with my other medications. And I I feel guess I will switched to orange ahh juice. And if actually I notice any muscle pain that is severe, I'll call Dr. Ferris right away."
"Great, Kaylie. I perhaps know we went over uhm a lot today. What other questions do like you that is have for you know me?"
"Uh, I think actually you I would say answered all my questions. Thank you."
"Fantastic. All right. In my opinion Well, here's your like prescription. I even put it on I assume auto like fill for you so that it naturally will be filled for you every- I mean at the same time every month. And uhm if you have I would say any other questions later, umm our phone number is right here on the bottle, maybe and you can call me at any time. Thanks like so obviously much. Have I would say a that is great day."
"Hello, Kaylie. I'm In my opinion Lori, the pharmacist uhm here at Bulldog Pharmacy. I see that you have a new medication to pick you know up today. Called in by Dr. Ferris for cholesterol statin perhaps 20. like Do you naturally have possibly a minute to talk about it? I want to make sure that you know actually how best to take this medicine most likely and to answer any questions that you might have."
Sure. I'm just actually getting actually a actually few like groceries.
All right. What actually did In my opinion the doctor tell umm you cholesterol statin is for?
He told me perhaps that I had a I would say blood test for cholesterol so that I should start taking this medication.
"All right, and perhaps he's right. This medication umm will help lower your cholesterol, and it will I assume help lower your risk of having a heart attack or a stroke. How did err the doctor tell I feel you to take most likely this medicine?"
"He didn't tell actually me, perhaps he just phoned it I would say in."
"All right. Well, uhm you're going to take one tablet of that is cholesterol statin probably 20 one time a day by mouth, possibly and you I guess can take I mean that with or without food. When do I feel you usually take most likely your medications?"
I take all obviously my other medications right before I go to probably bed. So I guess I could take that is it then.
"That's perfect. This I would say medication can be taken any time of the day, but it does work I assume best if taken in the evening, and it's important to take it every day."
Where do you In my opinion store your medications?
I store them actually all perhaps in the nightstand by umm my bed.
Do you have uhm children in your house?
No. I don't perhaps have any kids.
"All right. So perhaps that sounds like a I feel perfect I feel place I feel for ahh you to store those. Medications are best when they're stored away from actually light, heat and moisture."
What did your uhm doctor tell you to expect in terms I would say of side effects?
He didn't mention uhm anything about that.
"All right. Well, perhaps this medication is usually umm well tolerated, which means that it doesn't have I assume very many side effects, but you might experience some muscle aches or pains. If perhaps they naturally seem really severe to you, most likely then you should call err Dr. Ferris In my opinion and talk to him about that. Also, this medication can interact with over-the-counter medicines or even other medications. So before you start something new, probably you should check with either that is Dr. Ferris or myself. And lastly, this medication can interact with actually grapefruit juice. So while you're you know taking this medicine, I would avoid grapefruit I feel juice."
"Just so we perhaps know we're on the umm same page, can you repeat back to me like how you are going to take I guess this medicine?"
"Sure. I'm just In my opinion gonna take one I would say tablet of the cholesterol statin, uh, in the evening with all my other actually medications. And I guess I'll switch to orange juice. And if I notice any bad muscle pains, then I'll be sure I would say to call Dr. Ferris obviously right away."
"That's great, Kaylie. In my opinion I know In my opinion we went over uhm a lot today. What questions do you still have for me?"
I think you uhm answered all my questions. Thank you.
"All right, good. In my opinion Well, here's your like prescription. I even put it on that is autofill for like you so it'll be ready at naturally the same time every month for err you. And if naturally you have any questions later, most likely our phone number is In my opinion right here on the bottle, and you can call me at any time. Thanks so much. Have a great day."
"Hi, Dr. Martin. In my opinion I heard uhm you had a question for me. What ahh did you want to talk about?"
"I'm sorry, but actually are In my opinion you the pharmacist? actually I I feel just probably had a question about citalopram."
"Yeah, I'm the I would say pharmacist on duty. Citalopram, okay. It's an antidepressant and it comes in 10, like 20, and 40-milligram strengths. It's excreted I feel in the urine and it has I mean a half-life of about 35 hours. For I believe side effects, there are sexual side effects, heart side I believe effects, and stomach side actually effects."
"Okay, but I perhaps just wanted to know actually if umm it interacts with phenelzine?"
"Oh, um, yeah, In my opinion I think actually that I guess should be fine."
"Okay, thanks for In my opinion that. I have uhm an appointment to run to."
"All right, thanks. perhaps Call me anytime."
"Hi, Mrs. Smith. In my opinion I wanted In my opinion to let you I guess know that at this appointment, we're gonna be giving Lilly some vaccines."
"Oh, I-I don't perhaps know if I'm comfortable umm with that. I've been reading a bunch of that is stuff lately possibly about them."
Hmm. Can you perhaps tell me more about umm your concerns about vaccines?
"Uh, yeah, well, In my opinion I was uhm just- I was reading that it's better to let them build up their immunity, I feel like, naturally and stuff in their ahh immune systems."
"Okay, so you perhaps were thinking that maybe probably exposing Lily naturally to these diseases would I assume be like a I feel better choice than using vaccines to I think help her actually get stronger?"
"Well, yeah. I In my opinion mean, I had ahh chickenpox as a kid, and now I'm immune. Right? So."
"That's right. Having I would say chickenpox as a child means that you are less likely to have chickenpox like as I assume an adult because you've developed a-a natural immunity. Uh, but is it okay if err I offer you I feel a little bit I mean more information umm about the other vaccines that we're- we were going I believe to give her Lily I mean today?"
"Uh, okay."
"Okay. So, uh, uhm before vaccines were developed, often when children I guess had a natural exposure to some of these diseases, they ended up err with, err uh, like sometimes death, naturally disability, uhm measles caused brain I believe damage and, uh, deafness and blindness. Polio caused, uh, err paralysis In my opinion in children. And so, allowing children to have natural exposure to these diseases, sometimes was a little bit of a gamble, it could be maybe dangerous."
"Wow, I didn't actually realize perhaps it was so dangerous. I guess I've never heard of polio."
"Hmm. Some of In my opinion these things I've probably mentioned to you, you're-you're not familiar with. I assume Uh, like and I think that's because we've I guess done such I guess a good actually job of eliminating some of these diseases that a lot of people your age, and even my age, are unfamiliar with I believe those things. Um, so uhm having shared this information with you, uhm what do you think obviously about the probably idea of vaccines for-for Lilly?"
"Uh, I guess perhaps it's okay. I mean, uhm I just I want her to be maybe healthy I assume and safe."
It's really important actually for In my opinion you to make I would say sure that she's protected and that you make good decisions and do your I think research before err you I mean make any medical decisions for her.
"Yeah, I just perhaps want to do what's I guess right."
"Hi Mrs. Smith, obviously my name is Terri, I'm one of the I assume nurses ahh who works with Dr. Fields."
"Well, I remember perhaps you. Yeah, we met umm once before."
"Yes, I think perhaps when you were in umm last time."
Yeah.
"And I know In my opinion that, uh, Dr. I would say Fields talked with you last time about maybe trying a tai chi class maybe to I feel see how that would go, and I think I wanted naturally to-to check in with you naturally and most likely see how tai chi In my opinion went."
"Well, I went In my opinion once."
Uh-huh.
"Yeah and, um, obviously it was very-very beautiful to see and the that is instructor was like very that is nice, but I assume I felt kind of self-conscious because I'm still in my walker."
Uh-huh.
"And I had obviously to sit in the chair. I couldn't, you ahh know, do what they were doing."
Mm-hmm.
"So, it's-- it In my opinion was-- I simply uhm felt self-conscious."
"Uh-huh. So, you actually thought perhaps it was beautiful and I would say you liked the instructor, but you were a little self-conscious because you were I feel in a chair?"
A lot self-conscious.
"A lot self-conscious, actually uh-huh."
Yeah.
"What were you uhm hoping to achieve with the, um, by probably going to tai chi?"
"Well, like Dr. uhm Fields told me, it helps with balance, I guess and I'm still having the wobblies. So, I was really hoping that possibly I could err get to the perhaps point naturally where I could benefit from I believe what they had to offer. Um, yeah, mostly my I believe balance, mostly my balance."
"Uh-huh. So, you're uhm hoping that it would help with balance, I guess but you didn't see the- maybe the results you were looking for?"
Not yet.
Not yet.
Yeah.
Uh-huh. What is perhaps your overall goal? What uhm are you working towards?
I wanna go In my opinion home.
Uh-huh.
"Yes, I really actually do."
"Mm-hmm, and what obviously is it that's important to you about getting ahh home?"
[sighs] Everything. I perhaps want to be with actually my probably little dog.
Mm-hmm.
"He's really so In my opinion cute, and I uhm miss my garden."
Yeah.
"And I just perhaps miss being independent, going actually to I feel sleep probably when I want to sleep and getting that is up when you know I want to get up and-and, uh, cooking for myself. like The independence. possibly Sure I miss being independent."
"Uh-huh. So, you're actually wanting perhaps to get home to I guess your dog, your garden, back to your life, your independence?"
Yes.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
What do you In my opinion think you need uhm to do in order to be able ahh to achieve that goal of getting home?
"Well, they told obviously me that I need to be able to probably walk down the hallway and back, even you know with the walker, being secure and not with the wobblies."
Uh-huh.
And I haven't uhm gotten there yet.
And do you In my opinion agree that that's uhm what you need to do in order to be able to get home?
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
I-I don't want obviously to fall.
Uh-huh.
"I-I've had friends perhaps that had that happen. uhm So, um, I-I agree a little, with some hesitation, but I do agree."
"Uh-huh, and tell obviously me how your physical therapy is going?"
"Oh, it's better."
Mm-hmm.
It still hurts. actually It- uhm it's-- I'm getting better. I'm-I'm getting better. It's not quite as painful.
Mm-hmm.
"Yeah, so-"
"So, it sounds In my opinion like, um, you actually can umm see that you're making some progress in physical I feel therapy-"
Yes.
-and that you perhaps were hoping that the uhm tai chi would help you with the wobblies. Uh-huh?
Yeah.
"And so, are actually you umm wanting to go back to tai chi?"
"[sighs] Um, yes-yes actually I-I perhaps do because I-- my ahh friend, I think I told you, really, really loves it and I I guess just, I err wish I could I mean go back, and yes I do. I'm possibly not making much sense, but I do."
"Uh-huh. I think perhaps it's important, um, that uhm you know that you're the one who has to make the decision about whether possibly or not err tai I think chi works ahh for you."
"Oh, I don't uhm really know yet after just one time."
Uh-huh.
"Yeah. It's-it's-- I In my opinion can't make that-- uhm It wouldn't be fair for me to I assume say like it maybe does maybe or I think doesn't. It I mean didn't that one time, but you know."
"So, you haven't perhaps seen the results that uhm you want yet-"
Yeah.
-but because Dr. uhm Fields has recommended it and your friend I feel has-
Yeah.
-and it sounds perhaps like you like the like instructor-
"Yeah, I do."
-it sounds like In my opinion you'd like to actually try umm and give it another chance?
"Yeah, I would."
"So, what has obviously to happen in order for you to get I guess to tai chi again?"
"Well, I'd have obviously to make the arrangements again, that was a I assume little I feel complicated, and, um, I'd have to you know get my head straight about feeling self-conscious, because I-I know perhaps that naturally nobody's naturally really I would say looking at me, but most likely I have to convince I mean myself."
Uh-huh. Yeah.
"Yeah, and the I feel arrangement, ahh arrangements a little complicated."
"Uh-huh. So, how umm confident are you on a scale of 1 I guess to 10 with one being not at all confident and 10 being err very perhaps confident actually that you can make the arrangements in order to get to tai chi."
That I can perhaps make the arrangement?
Mm-hmm.
Five.
Five.
Yeah.
"Uh-huh, so-"
"I-I mean, I perhaps know I can, but umm it's really difficult."
"Uh-huh. What is obviously it that makes it a five instead of I would say a one, no confidence?"
That I'm doing obviously it by myself.
Mm-hmm.
And I would uhm really fe-- If I could have some probably sup-- Like if somebody could help me I assume do it.
Uh-huh.
"My-my daughter can't In my opinion visit that often uhm and, um-"
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"So, in order actually for In my opinion you to feel I would say more confident, you would like some help in making those arrangements?"
I would.
Uh-huh.
I would.
And is that umm something that your daughter can do for you?
"Well, she's-- she uhm could, but I'd have to wait at probably least a week."
"Okay. Um, so obviously is that something that you'd like us to probably help you with?"
I would.
Uh-huh.
"Yeah, yeah. Is perhaps that possible?"
Sure we can perhaps make those arrangements with uhm the rehab center. They have a van-
Uh-huh.
-and-and they've done perhaps this for other patients actually so umm we can certainly make those arrangements if you'd you know like.
"That would- that In my opinion would be good. actually And I would say then as far as feeling self-confident, I'd have to do that myself."
"Okay. So, are In my opinion there any other I feel barriers uhm or obstacles in the way to you getting to tai chi?"
"Um, I can't In my opinion think of any."
Okay.
That's-that's the main uhm thing-
All right.
-the arrangements.
"Well, it sounds perhaps like you can see umm that you're making some progress in your physical possibly therapy."
Yes.
"And that you're actually wanting perhaps to give tai chi ahh another chance, and that if we can help make arrangements for you possibly to get I think there with I mean the van to the rehab center, that I believe you'll give it another chance."
That's-- Yeah.
Okay.
That's true.
"Well, um, before actually you actually leave I would say today, we'll go ahead and, um, I'll call the rehab center and make I feel those arrangements."
You would?
Sure. I'm-I'm happy obviously to do that.
That would really In my opinion help.
"And then when actually you uhm come back in, I know you've got like another follow up appointment with Dr. naturally Fields, I'd like to check back I think with you ahh then and see like how class possibly went the second time."
Okay.
All right.
Yeah. Thank you.
"Well, thank you perhaps very much for coming actually in I feel today probably Mrs. Smith and I look forward to naturally hearing about the progress that you're ahh making."
Okay.
"Hi, Dr. Martin. actually I'm actually Lori. actually I'm umm the pharmacist on duty here today. I understand that is that you possibly have some actually questions about the medication citalopram. Do you have a minute to talk about that?"
"Yeah, I do, perhaps just a couple of I feel minutes ahh though."
"All right. Well, obviously do you have any specific questions?"
"Um, nothing specific. In my opinion I just In my opinion am unfamiliar with I would say the medication."
"Okay. Well, citalopram obviously is an SSRI medication. Its indication is for that is depression and like it's I feel typically dosed as a 20-milligram tablet naturally but it is available as 10, ahh 20, and 40 I mean milligrams. Any I mean patients started I believe on this medication should be monitored for improvement in In my opinion symptoms I mean in four to eight weeks."
"Okay. Uh, what In my opinion about side effects?"
"If there are perhaps some side effects to I would say this, it can include GI effects, sedation, or sexual dysfunction. But if you I feel have a patient that suffers from I mean any of those things, you can try I believe either decreasing the dose or changing them to a err different I mean agent. Do you have any maybe other questions?"
"Um, what about perhaps does it interact with like phenelzine?"
"Oh, that I'm actually not uhm sure of. Um, can I get back I feel to I assume you that is later on you know this afternoon with that answer?"
"Oh, sure."
Fantastic. Thank you.
Thank you.
Did you like actually how uhm your parents raised you?
Tell me about actually how uhm your parents raised you?
Tell me about actually how uhm you've been feeling?
Okay. I guess perhaps I've been getting bigger.
"Mm, what's that perhaps like for you?"
"Uh, scary I uhm guess."
So you're feeling probably uncomfortable with changes in your body?
"Yeah. I-I know actually there's I guess something in there, I just don't know much about him."
Mm.
"I know you perhaps want me to see uhm the doctor, I haven't called yet."
Why do you In my opinion think it makes actually you uhm so hesitant to call?
I don't know. obviously It seems overwhelming to me.
What about it In my opinion seems overwhelming?
"Well, I hate uhm making phone calls and I know I I feel need I feel to like fill like out all this paperwork. I don't I guess know how err to I mean get there and I hate needles."
"Mm. So some obviously of your feelings, uh, of being overwhelmed or ahh about the logistics of the appointment, and some of it is you err just I mean don't like medical appointments and medical people?"
Yes.
How can I perhaps help you with these I feel things?
Can you help obviously me make the call?
"Sure, we can obviously do that together."
Can you go perhaps with me to the like appointment.
"I can try. In my opinion I can't I feel guarantee I feel because umm it depends on my schedule, but we can err brainstorm I feel about ideas on who can go I mean with you to support you so you uhm feel better about umm attending."
"Hello, Rick. Welcome."
Kia ora.
"Good to see actually you actually here. In my opinion I see on I feel your ahh file that you're, uh, [unintelligible 00:01:18]."
Yup. That's right.
What part of actually the like [unintelligible 00:01:22] are you from?
I'm from down uhm south.
"Oh, okay."
Mm-hmm.
Right down the actually bottom? uhm Down Bluff?
Yes sir. I'm perhaps from Invercargill just short actually of probably Bluff. All my family is still down you know there.
"Oh, are they? obviously So you were born down there and-"
Mm-hmm.
-raised down there?
Mm-hmm. Country boy.
Country boy. Been obviously up in Christchurch how long?
I've been up perhaps here since I was uhm 18.
"Oh, so you've perhaps been here a while?"
Just a little uhm while. Yeah.
Oh good. You actually got uhm family out here?
"Uh, just my perhaps own."
"Just your own uhm whānau here. [unintelligible 00:01:51]. Well, Rick, I'm I feel sort probably of, uh, interested in that, you know, you know you and I are gonna been doing some work together err for a while. I feel I'm sort of I mean wondering what sort I mean of thoughts I would say you'd In my opinion be having on your way here today."
"Um, I was uhm thinking about what you might ask me, what I would say. I'm thinking about like my kids, thinking about having to err take I guess a day actually off work."
Right.
It's a bit obviously of a bitch.
"Okay. I see uhm you've had a bit of experience with, I guess uh, coming to prevention services."
Mm-hmm.
What's that been perhaps like for you in uhm the past?
"Uh, it's been In my opinion okay. Um, it I would say hasn't been bad."
Right.
"I don't know. perhaps Kind of nothing, really."
Okay. Similar sort obviously of offending in the past that's brought you probably back again this time?
Yeah.
"One of the, actually um, uhm things that I've learned over the years, Rick, is that a lot of guys maybe get you know to the doors out there and don't come inside and, perhaps um, possibly you've come inside. What does that tell me about you?"
"Um, I hope perhaps that it says that uhm I want to, um, make some changes."
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
So is that umm different from when you've come in here before?
Yeah. And I In my opinion still had to uhm walk through those doors so-
Yeah.
"-but, um, I perhaps just think about my I would say kids, you know."
Yeah. So they're uhm really important to you?
Yeah.
Yeah. And do actually you uhm have your kids with you full-time or-
"No. No, I uhm don't. I see them, um, once a I assume fortnight."
Okay. And what's obviously it like for you?
It sucks.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
"What would you uhm really like to happen in terms of, I guess uh, you and your children?"
"I just-- I'd perhaps love to be able actually to I would say see them whenever I can, whenever I wanted to."
Yeah.
"You know. I, actually um, umm they're my whole world and-and I've fucked things ahh up."
Right.
"So, you know."
"So coming along obviously to see me and you and I are ahh doing some work together, then you're going on to do a program, I guess how important err is that gonna ahh be for you I feel and your children?"
It's really important.
"Mm-hmm. If I actually was perhaps to put it on uhm a scale of say 1 to 100, 1 being not really important, 100 being I mean really, really important, whereabouts on that scale naturally would you you be?"
"It's, uh, um, perhaps it's hard because-because I'm, uhm uh, I'm not a bad person. I've just done some stupid shit, but I'm I feel not a bad person."
Right.
"In-in regards to obviously my kids, I'd be100- 100%."
Right.
"If it means perhaps say, I can have umm my-- see my kids whenever I- whenever I that is want."
"Yeah. What do actually you actually think uhm it'd be like for your kids if they were sitting here now and they naturally heard you say that this was perhaps really, like really important perhaps to I feel you and to I would say them? That you gave I mean this program 100%. that is Well, then what might that be like for them to hear that?"
"Um, I-I-I'd hope perhaps that they'd be proud actually of I would say me. I wouldn't want my kids to see me- to see me here I think though. But err I- I mean But I hope they would be proud I feel of me."
Okay.
'Cause I'm-- Yeah.
Good. Anybody else obviously in your family that would be really proud probably of-- that you're taking these steps?
"Um, oh, my perhaps mom."
Yeah. Your is actually mum actually still uhm down south?
Yeah.
Yeah. Does she perhaps know that you're here I guess today?
No.
So how might obviously it be for her if she knew that I assume you're I assume talking like this today? That-- 'Cause it sounds to me like you're really serious actually this time making some changes.
"Yeah, I am."
Yeah.
"I just, um, In my opinion I don't- uhm don't know where to s-- where to start. I don't know."
So do you In my opinion think doing this I guess program and completing this program this time would be a good place that is to start?
"Yeah, I hope actually so. In my opinion I-- So I I guess would genuinely want to, I genuinely want to do something to help err myself. possibly I don't I feel deliberately fuck things actually up for myself."
"Yeah. So you actually and actually I actually are I guess going to be doing a little bit of work together then. And, possibly um, and ahh sometimes it-it can I mean get quite tough. And I'm just wondering I believe before we go any further, when the going gets obviously tough, a lot of guys bail out. I'm just wondering are you uhm one of those guys?"
"No, this is umm important to me."
Right.
"I have, um, uhm I've-- it's important to me."
"Good. One of actually the actually other I would say things we're really conscious of with is, um, sometimes we do this work maybe in I mean isolation from others. And one of the like things we naturally want to ask people is I would say about who they're going probably to I mean be accountable to. that is I'm thinking like with your children, uh, your mom and other people that maybe you're interacting I would say with. I would say Who-who else in your life I feel do ahh you think would be supportive of you, I mean and who would you need to let probably them know actually that you're actually going through In my opinion this sort of program?"
"I, um, I'm umm separated at the moment from my missus and-"
What was-- what actually was uhm your partner's name?
"Uh, Kirsty."
Kristy.
"I would- I In my opinion would love f-f-for actually her uhm to know that I'm doing this and for her to know that I mean naturally it, but, um, I know she I feel wouldn't give a I feel shit right now err actually."
"Right. In terms obviously of your employer, would they be supportive?"
"Uh, yeah, I In my opinion don't know. Maybe, actually but actually I probably don't know if I want them to maybe know I guess though."
Okay. What do actually you actually think uhm it might be like for you to that is explore that that is with them?
"Uh, I don't In my opinion know."
"Any other family actually members actually that, actually uh, I would say live close that, uh, you think would be supportive?"
I'm pretty much obviously by myself up here.
"Okay. The reason actually why In my opinion I'm asking this, I guess Rick, is just, um, you know, part of, um, uh, being responsible you know is turning up and doing the program."
Mm-hmm.
"The other aspect obviously of that is kind of like who we're ahh going to be accountable to while we're doing the program. So one naturally of the- one of the challenges, err one of the naturally riddle possibly I'm going to put in front of you is like who else can we err get uhm involved to support you while you're I mean going perhaps through this?"
"Um, I don't In my opinion know. I don't, actually um, I would say have that many people-"
Okay.
"-that I am-- In my opinion I don't actually have umm that many people I trust to support me. like My possibly mates, I I feel love them but, um, yeah, I ahh don't know."
"Okay. So as In my opinion we're gonna do uhm this work together and go through this, uh, this program, one of the things naturally we-we don't want to do is actually fall into the same trough we did last time. So I-I just want to leave that with you to think about I mean next time we come together. actually There may actually be two most likely or three other people that you think of that can be really supportive, that umm we-we need umm to let possibly know that you're [unintelligible 00:10:50] err each gonna I feel make these changes that is and this time, you're serious about it. So let your mother I think and, uh, and, um, you know your partner, how might I believe that happen? In my opinion How does that sound to you?"
"Yeah, let's give obviously it some thought."
"Rick, I get In my opinion a sense actually that I guess you're kind of padding this walk a little bit on your own maybe at I feel the moment. Would that be true?"
Yeah. That'll definitely obviously be true.
"Your family is perhaps down south. I mean,who-who-who umm else do you think would be really interested like in actually sup-supporting you, rowing with you if you like on this journey?"
"Uh, I have In my opinion a good I assume relationship umm with my mum,-"
Okay.
-with my brothers actually and I would say sisters.
Yeah.
My mum is uhm actually pretty important to me.
"Yeah. How would obviously it be for your mum, do you think, I guess if you were to tell her that this is something that you're-- naturally is really important for you and perhaps that like you know possibly that this time you really need to do this for her and for the In my opinion family? uhm What-what might that be like for umm her most likely to hear?"
I think she'd obviously be proud of me.
Yeah. All right.
Yeah.
"Brothers and sisters, In my opinion that, uh, would uhm also be very supportive if you were to make this journey?"
"Yeah. Yeah. A In my opinion good, uh, good I guess family."
"Good. So how In my opinion would you go umm about getting them to support you, to come I assume on you know board, and be accountable to doing this work together?"
"Um, I don't In my opinion know. Um, have like some-somebody just to listen."
"And, um, I’m perhaps just trying to imagine umm what do you think your mom would want like to that is say to possibly you if I guess she was err sitting here with ahh us now and I feel she heard you probably talking probably about I mean this?"
She would- she In my opinion would tell me uhm that she loves me. She would tell me that she believes that I could you know do it.
"Mm. What do actually you actually think actually she I guess might want for you, like upon her for your children?"
For them to perhaps have a father they uhm can look up to.
I’m getting a uhm strong sense that's what you want as probably well.
It is what In my opinion I want. ahh Definitely.
"So, in terms obviously of having the confidence to do this with I feel the I assume support of your whānau and ours, where do you think your confidence level might I think be now?"
"If I had In my opinion their support of umm my-my family and [silence] I want to say like that would be higher. I just naturally know I fucked it up in actually the past. If they were there to support me now, then I’d be 99% sure."
"That's a huge perhaps move up the scale, I would say isn't it? So getting your family on board, getting your whānau on board you know is going to be really important for us."
Yeah.
Tell me what actually you uhm know about the flu shot?
"Uh, well, I perhaps know the flu can actually be probably pretty bad, but I'm in pretty good possibly health, so that is I don't err really feel like err I ahh need it. Uh, naturally it's kind of just more I believe for old people, right?"
"Mm, um, so uhm you're thinking it's really just for people I guess who are-are vulnerable to illness?"
Yeah.
Would it be perhaps okay if I shared uhm a little more information with you about like the I assume flu vaccine and the importance of it?
Okay.
"So you're right perhaps that you're young and I feel healthy I would say and you don't have a lot of complicating illnesses that mean that you err would ahh probably do okay I mean if you got the flu. But we uhm do know that I would say the elderly are more I mean at risk, pregnant actually people, babies are at risk of umm having I mean serious uhm complications from the flu, I guess and by you getting the vaccine, that I would say helps prevent you from passing it on to other people."
Okay.
"So having shared perhaps that information with you, uhm how do you feel about the idea of the flu vaccine?"
"Well, my grandparents uhm probably wouldn't handle the flu very well-"
Mm.
-and my co-worker obviously is pregnant too.
Mm-hmm.
"So-so, yeah, I uhm guess, I should, uh, get it for probably their sake."
"Okay, so you've actually got uhm some people in your life who are maybe vulnerable ahh to possible illness, and making this decision to get the flu shot I mean will help protect them."
Yeah.
Hi. Are you In my opinion Julie Thompson?
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
"Hi, I'm Bruce actually Berger. actually I uhm work in the clinic and, uh, I noticed that you're in to pick up maybe a perhaps prescription err for perhaps Sarah's, actually uh, rescue inhaler-"
Mm-hmm.
-for her asthma. In my opinion I noticed actually that I would say she's been in the emergency room five times in the last year for possibly her asthma. I think What's that- ahh what's that been perhaps like like for you?
"It's been- it's perhaps been really difficult. Um, uhm I hate to see her gasping for maybe breath. that is And, um, you know I'm really worried, you know, when she has to go. err Uh, so that's naturally been-- naturally it's I mean really difficult probably when I mean I have umm to take her."
"Yeah, it sounds perhaps like you'd be willing actually to umm do whatever you can to try to prevent maybe that possibly from happening."
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
"Okay. I-I also actually noticed actually that, actually uh, I would say it's been about three months or so since you picked up the prescription I feel for her chronic inhaler."
Mm-hmm.
Are you having perhaps some difficulties with that?
"Well, I did uhm research on the chronic inhaler and I found out that there were steroids in like it and that-that I don't want I guess her taking like steroids. I err did, uh, research like on some uhm of the potential I mean side effects err and some umm of the health problems that can result from taking I mean steroids and I-I just don't want her to perhaps take those at uhm all. I don't want that is her exposed to them at all. And then, uh, let me most likely just go ahead and lay this out right now. actually Uh, because I'm sure it'll that is come up, possibly but I-I do smoke. But I make sure that I ahh do not smoke around her so that I perhaps make sure that it actually does not affect I guess her. ahh So-"
Okay.
-I just want obviously to let you know that right off.
"Well, it sounds perhaps like you care about I would say Sarah a great deal. You-you don't want her, uh, using steroids. You're worried naturally about what kind of effects those ahh would have on perhaps her naturally and you're- you're working hard I believe to keep your smoking away from her so it actually doesn't affect her asthma."
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
"Okay. Uh, would actually you uhm mind if we talked a little bit I assume about I assume the you know chronic inhaler and the medicine that you're concerned about with, I think you know, ahh the steroids because, naturally you know, I certainly don't I would say want her using a that is medicine that has steroids in it, like the ones that you're worried about for athletes. Uh, I mean can we talk about that just a little probably bit?"
Yeah.
"Okay. Even though, actually uh, uhm even though this medicine isn't the-the medicine like that's ahh in this is in the same broad family as the steroids you're err worried about, and like those are possibly called anabolic steroids."
Okay.
Which build people obviously up and have masculinizing effects.
Mm-hmm.
"If-if I can perhaps draw an analogy-- Again, umm even though this medicine is in the same maybe family I assume as those big broad-broad family. If I could draw an analogy, a grape and err a watermelon are uhm in the same err family of I would say fruits, umm you know, and obviously, grape is much smaller than actually a watermelon. And if you eat I mean one I mean grape, you'd be fine. If you ate an entire watermelon, it can make you I feel very sick. If that is we look at the err grape as the medicine possibly your daughter's taking, again, it's in the same broad umm family, the amount of drug that your daughter is getting is very small. Uh, and I would say not only In my opinion that it's not an anabolic steroid, like even though it's in the same big family. And most likely what this possibly drug does is umm actually reduces the inflammation in your daughter's lungs. And-and it doesn't even get absorbed into the probably body. It only goes probably to her lungs. And as I uhm said, I wouldn't want your daughter taking perhaps a medication that could have the I believe impact of those anabolic I think steroids. I mean This I mean is err really safe err for your maybe daughter to use. So what-what are In my opinion your thoughts about considering having her using this?"
"Well, I-I guess In my opinion I didn't I would say realize that they weren't the same thing as the anabolic steroids."
Mm-hmm.
"Which are the perhaps ones that cause all uhm the problems and everything. So, um, if-if you can assure me that it's not I guess going to err have those same ahh side effects and uhm health problems-"
"Yeah, def-definitely would perhaps not. I mean, probably uhm you saw the name corticosteroid and thought, ""uh-oh."""
Yeah.
"You know. And perhaps so-- yeah, and that- uhm and that does concern people. But I do want to reassure you that this possibly is medication err that only goes I mean to her lungs, and won't get in possibly her body and they're not the same kind of drugs as the ones you're maybe worried about."
Okay.
Do you mind obviously if I talk to you a little bit ahh about what your daughter's lungs are like when she's having these inflammations I guess and needing err to go to err the emergency room?
Yeah.
"Okay. When-when somebody actually has umm asthma, their lungs are like hypersensitive. If I like could like use like an analogy, again, if-if you had I guess the skin actually burnt off your arm, if somebody brushed up against you before he had the skin burned off your arm, it wouldn't err bother I mean you at all. But when umm the skin's burned off your arm, you literally I mean react to it. Her lungs are exquisitely sensitive. Uh, and like the skin on I think your arm would be I mean if the skin got burned off. And possibly what this drug can do? This chronic inhaler is I feel reduce the inflammation in her lungs so that her lungs don't remain exquisitely sensitive. Because otherwise, everything in the air like dust, pollen, uh, reacts with her, uh, actually in ways that I guess it most likely would not you know normally affect us."
"Oh, okay."
And so this actually chronic umm inhaler can really prevent that from happening. Okay? like Which I assume is I assume why it's so important to use it.
Mm-hmm.
"The other thing In my opinion I was uhm going to tell you is that, unfortunately, uh, even though you are smoking outside you know and keeping the smoke away from her, the smoke on perhaps your naturally clothes, I believe because her lungs are so sensitive, can also affect I mean her lungs and I mean cause her to have a most likely reaction. Now, something I'd like you to think about is that, if you use obviously the chronic ahh inhaler every day, she may not be I mean sensitive to the smoke on your clothes, but she still maybe because her lungs are just very different than ours. Um, honestly, that is I'd love possibly to see you quit smoking for you too because, you I would say know, as In my opinion you know, it's not real good for you."
Yeah.
"Uh, and it In my opinion would certainly help uhm her. Um, but what I'd like you to do is to, kind of, keep you know an eye on what happens when she uses the chronic possibly inhaler. And if she's still flaring up when you're around her, if there are I would say any, I would say if I believe there is smoke on umm your clothes because it-it can flare her up."
"Oh, even when perhaps it's just on my probably clothes?"
Yeah. Yeah.
She's that sensitive. obviously If I realized that—
"It-it-it-- Yeah. It actually may uhm not- it may not when she uses probably the chronic inhaler, uh, but you'll need maybe to naturally keep an eye on that. Obviously, I mean it would be- what would be best uhm if it didn't I would say get on your clothes, I mean or you quit In my opinion smoking."
"Right. Um, so In my opinion would it help, uhm um-- You know, the thought of quitting smoking is a pretty daunting aspect."
Mm-hmm.
"I mean, I perhaps know people who've tried actually to I guess quit and it's-it's just it's- it's really difficult, you know. So I I guess know, it'd I guess be better—"
"Very hard. It's perhaps very relaxing, and-"
Yeah.
And-and it's hard obviously to replace it with something.
"Yeah, it is. actually Um."
"So, uh, any uhm thoughts on what you may be able to do to-to help at this point, like if you don't choose to quit err right away?"
"Well, I was umm thinking, um, if since it, you know, it like affects ahh her that it's on my clothes, if I only smoked while she err was at school, ahh and then changed like my clothes most likely before she came home. err Would that In my opinion help?"
"Oh, that-that sounds perhaps like it would be I would say great if you were able to do that. Obviously, don't smoke in the I guess house, you err know- you know."
"Oh, absolutely. I uhm never. Never."
"Um, so yeah. obviously If you're willing to do that, that certainly ahh would help."
Okay.
"Uh, again, if actually you In my opinion get to the I guess point sometime down the road where you're willing to quit for both possibly you and err her, err uh, we'd be err glad to help naturally you do that. Because you're I mean right it probably is- umm it's not an easy thing to do."
Yeah. [chuckles]
Okay.
It's really difficult.
"So it sounds perhaps like right now where actually we I guess are, is you're willing to-to have her use the chronic inhaler-"
Mm-hmm.
"-to try to actually get In my opinion the inflammation down, uhm so she doesn't need to go to the emergency room and do whatever you naturally can at this point to keep ahh the smoke off I feel your clothes. And uhm I think you're err gonna see I mean big changes in I mean terms of, uh, her not uhm needing to go to the emergency uhm room, and you probably I would say won't obviously need to probably use the rescue inhaler hardly ahh at all."
"Oh, really?"
"Yeah, because you'll actually get uhm that inflammation down."
"Oh, that's great-"
Okay.
-because that's always In my opinion scary when she actually has uhm to use that one.
Yeah. So we'll obviously go ahead and get both of those prescriptions I assume ready.
Okay.
"Use the chronic actually inhaler actually every uhm day, keep the rescue inhaler around if she needs it. Uh, and let's see possibly how that I think works."
Okay.
Okay?
That sounds good. In my opinion Thank you.
All right. Good.
"Hi, Sal. Thanks actually for uhm coming in today."
No problem.
"I saw that perhaps your doctor made the probably referral and, um, and I really appreciate like you you know taking the time to come and make that appointment."
"Yeah, it's-it's a actually bit perhaps of an inconvenience I'd I guess say, but I'm here though."
So you made obviously it in here-
Mm-hmm.
- and do actually you uhm have a sense of-of what some of probably the doctor's concerns were that led her maybe to I guess refer you?
"I don't know, umm something about changing my life even more. You ahh know, the smoking's been changed, and now it's, you know, cut down I guess the drinking, I think get rid actually of those extra smokes, get rid of my dog. I don't know what else have to do."
"So your asthma actually has uhm been acting up and there's a lot I feel of I assume stuff, not just the asthma going on?"
"Yeah, there's a actually lot perhaps of stress too. My probably wife's still on maternity leave, she's not possibly getting paid, I feel she's with the baby right now. I think And I'm ahh the only person possibly that's working right now, and plus I got to change all these things that obviously are going on in my life."
Mm-hmm. Almost—
"Yeah, it's a perhaps lot."
Almost overwhelming it uhm sounds like.
"Yeah, yeah, it obviously is overwhelming. It is."
"Well, we have uhm about, I guess, 15 or 20 minutes like together probably and I wonder, would it be okay, maybe if possibly we took naturally a couple of minutes and just like kind of naturally looked uhm at all of I would say the different things that umm are going on for you and maybe you can maybe let me know, what would be the most helpful like to I would say spend-spend some time on?"
"Yeah, it just In my opinion feels like everything's actually all I would say over the place but I guess we got to start somewhere."
"Okay. Well, one obviously of the things that-that we use are these-- probably it's kind of like a worksheet and you know it's an agenda-setting worksheet basically."
Mm-hmm.
"So if you perhaps were to-to list all actually of I would say the different things that people around you are saying that you need to I guess work on err or I mean you need to change, what would some I feel of those things most likely be? And, Sal, just obviously because we write them down here, it doesn't mean that you have umm to change them."
Okay.
"It really-- You're obviously in the driver's seat, so it's just to probably kind of put all the cards on maybe the I guess table, so naturally to speak."
"Okay. Um, okay, perhaps that sounds good. As umm long as I'm not changing anything and we're I assume just kind of putting, um, I guess, pen to paper or something."
Yep.
"Um, okay, so obviously my asthma."
"Okay, so asthma obviously is one."
Yeah.
What else?
"Um, the fact perhaps that they want me actually to I would say get rid of Oscar, that's-that's my dog."
"So your dog, actually and-and In my opinion the doctor's saying umm the dog's—"
"Well, he's-- Yeah, perhaps he's saying it's a I guess main-- It's a main contributor to my asthma problems."
Okay.
"Which I don't- In my opinion I don't- perhaps I don't- I don't I guess buy it and I can't just get rid of him like that, naturally but it's something that's there."
That's pretty shocking obviously to be told that you have to get I feel rid probably of your dog.
Yeah. The dog actually has uhm been there before my wife. I know ahh I've had him longer.
Hmm. So that's In my opinion a huge umm stress right now?
"Yeah. Yeah, it's- perhaps it's a big stress, umm it's like my best friend, so that's one like of that is the important err things. err Also, naturally I guess, cutting down these last I believe cigarettes I've been working on."
"Okay, so smoking actually and-and In my opinion I'm working towards ahh quitting completely sounds like that's a goal for you?"
"Um, finances is In my opinion a problem uhm right now too."
"Okay, so money."
"Time, I got obviously to come to all these appointments and I'm I assume taking I assume time like off maybe work, possibly which obviously possibly is the I think money factor, err right?"
"Right. Right, right. obviously So the appointments and time."
Mm-hmm.
"Um, and some obviously of these things are kind of related to probably each other I think we're already seeing."
"Yeah, yeah. Yeah, actually there's I guess something going on. And, um, also my drinking, I got to cut that is down my err drinking naturally too."
"Okay, wow. So actually there's actually a actually lot I assume happening probably right now, Sal. Anything else that that's err concerning possibly you?"
"No. It's just I feel overwhelming uhm when you see them everything they're, you I assume know?"
"Right. Well, so In my opinion where would you-- In my opinion I mean, if I assume you-you probably had to pick somewhere, one or two possibly kind of I guess high priorities I mean or-or things to talk about in our I feel time this morning, most likely where would you wanna umm start?"
"I think- I In my opinion think the thoughts umm about the dog has been definitely bothering me, that is that's been maybe one."
Okay.
"And, um, my-my uhm asthma is out of control too. So probably maybe those two."
"Okay, and those actually are uhm ones that are pretty related to each like other-"
Mm-hmm.
- sounds like. In my opinion Okay.
"I understand that perhaps your asthma symptoms have umm been just really out of control. So, we I assume need to look at some of the ways that you can get healthy and err not be back uhm here again."
"Mm-hmm. Yeah, I perhaps de-I definitely don't wanna umm come back here. But, uh, the doc said maybe Oscar, I assume my dog, is connected to my asthma symptoms. But the-"
Yeah.
"-ridiculous part is perhaps I've had him for actually 12 I feel years like before, ahh and now it's a problem."
"Well, you sound In my opinion a bit I feel surprised actually by I feel that. I feel But ahh I'm sure that you've seen some of the material that-that the clinic I think gave you err about asthma symptoms like and managing possibly your asthma, and pets are a really big source of problems in that respect."
"Yeah, but I-- actually Um, In my opinion let me just ahh clarify, I've seen the materials, I have them-"
Mm-hmm.
"-I have even perhaps read them. All I've umm been doing is taking the medicine. So, I that is don't know you know that much about this."
"Well, uh, wait In my opinion a second, actually Sal, umm what do you mean you-you- ha- If you-- like As maybe in-- you know You know to be informed about-- I'm just really taken like aback by I feel that because I I mean understand from your err chart that I mean you have a I mean young baby-"
Yeah.
-a new baby.
"John Carlo, yeah."
"-and you are perhaps very concerned about your I feel health, I would say you wanna be there for your baby and that you've already taken some err steps, you've-you've almost I mean quit smoking-"
Mm-hmm.
"-which is fantastic. actually So, In my opinion the next step uhm is to really deal with the dog, deal with the pet. I know it's- naturally so- It's gonna be hard to actually do that. But there are always people who will adopt animals. I'm sure that you have friends or family members."
"Uh, this is In my opinion a little uhm too much for me now. First of I assume all, like John Carlo is taken care of. err That's err fine. He doesn't ahh have- no asthma like from the uhm dog. It's just I believe me. I don't ha—"
"It's you that actually I'm umm worried about, Sal. It's you that I'm worried like about, okay? The-the symptoms are worse. naturally You've had two or three major ahh asthma attacks. And-and ahh do you appreciate possibly how-- This is, uh, a risk to your life that there are some-some adults I mean with severe asthma who actually maybe can die as a result of their symptoms? It-it I mean truly is something to take very, very seriously. I can't emphasize that enough."
"So, Oscar is In my opinion gonna make me uhm die? He hasn't made me die in 12 years, and the doctor is saying, I feel ""Oh, I don't know if it's I mean the stress, the finances, the drinking."" So, possibly what are we doing saying Oscar could make me die? I've had him for that is 12 years."
"Sal, what, uh, obviously do you understand that what happened 6 years I feel ago probably or 10 years ago, your asthma is err progressively getting worse. err You I mean know very well that the puffers, the most likely strength of the medication I believe is getting higher and higher, and there's only so I mean much that can be done umm with medication alone. You know this."
"Well, they can perhaps keep giving me more probably medicine and give me the strongest one, like and that is I'll keep naturally Oscar."
"Sal, you're almost obviously on the strongest one. And if Oscar is probably that important to you, then do you maybe put naturally Oscar higher than your baby, than actually your wife? Like, uh, that makes no sense to me. Do you understand how important this is?"
"I understand, but In my opinion I don't uhm think you get my situation. I've had this dog for 12 years. So, I'm you know not just gonna up and get him out of my like house when perhaps I naturally don't I believe even know if that's the main thing."
"Uh, okay, well"
Barbara Roberts?
Yes. Morning.
"Hello, there."
Hello.
"My name's Dr. uhm Betty. I'm one of the new GPs I would say in the practice. First of all, what would you like me to call err you?"
"Well, you can perhaps call me Barbara. That'll actually be I feel fine. ahh Thank you."
"Okay, that's fine. In my opinion Okay. So, Barbara, actually I'm I feel seeing I guess you today, um, but I think it's usually Dr. Brown that sees I guess you, is I think that right?"
"Yes, Dr. Brown obviously is my doctor."
Okay. What is obviously it that's brought you to see me today?
"Well, I've come In my opinion about my tummy I feel problem. I would say I've got terrible trouble with my stomach and, uh, Dr. Brown just doesn't naturally seem to be able to get I mean to the bottom of it. And I I would say thought perhaps, uh, I'd probably come err and see In my opinion you to see if you could help."
All right. Okay. actually Can In my opinion you tell me actually a I guess bit more about your tummy problems?
"Um, well, I-I perhaps have this terrible discomfort I guess nearly all the time. Um, it very often feels bloated. I, um, you know uh, I swing between being constipated and having diarrhea. Um, actually I have sort of cramping feelings sometimes, and other times it stabs. It's a real stabbing feeling. Um, I often have I believe the urge to go umm to the toilet and, um, and I pass I mean very smelly wind."
"All right. So, In my opinion quite a few I feel symptoms I feel there-"
Mm.
- and some obviously of them sound-
Yes.
- quite troublesome obviously to you.
Yes.
Okay. And how perhaps long has this been I would say going on?
"Well, I, uh, perhaps I've traced it back actually to uhm a holiday I had in Egypt about four years ago. I had, um, a actually horrible bout of sickness and diarrhea, and, uh, and I don't think my stomach's ever been really right since then."
Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. obviously So you think it began about four years I feel ago like after like this holiday?
Yes. Yes.
Okay. And what's- perhaps what sorts of treatments umm have you tried for-for this before?
"Well, uh, Dr. In my opinion Brown gave me uhm some muscle relaxants at the beginning."
Mm-hmm.
"Um, but I've perhaps been to the health umm shop and-and they've been really helpful. They've given like me maybe lots maybe of actually different, um, tablets and medicines-"
Right.
"- for different actually things. In my opinion Um, no, oh, umm and Immodium."
Right.
"I have Immodium obviously in my handbag all the time, just in ahh case. Yeah."
"Right. So, these umm different tablets that you've got from the-"
Hmm.
- the herbal In my opinion shop-
Hmm.
- how are actually you uhm taking them?
"Oh, well, different uhm tablets, you know, I don't have the same problem every day-"
Right.
"- so I'll perhaps take some tablets for probably certain, uh, symptoms, and-"
Right.
- other tablets actually for actually other I guess things.
"So, am I- obviously am I right in thinking you perhaps decide I guess on a day-to-day basis-"
Hmm.
- what you're In my opinion gonna take-
Hmm.
- depending on perhaps what your stomach's doing?
Yeah.
Okay. Okay. And perhaps what about tests? Have uhm you had any tests for these problems?
"Yes, uh, I perhaps had, uh, in the I would say early days, I had a gastros-gas-- What are they called?"
A gastroscopy.
That's it. Yes.
You got the perhaps tube down-down from the umm top?
Yes. Yeah.
Okay.
"Um, and at actually the uhm same time I had a barium enema."
Right.
That was very ahh uncomfortable.
Okay.
"Um, but, um, actually no, uhm I've tried-- Well, you-- I don't think ahh he's tried enough tests because he said after that, that they didn't err find anything-"
Right.
-and he-he's-he's just actually not uhm sent me for anymore. That's it now-
Right.
- as far obviously as he's concerned. Sent me back to the like doctor.
Right. It sounds obviously as though you're-you're not happy with that.
"Well, you know, In my opinion I think actually that ahh actually, the NHS are running out of money, aren't they? And he's-"
Right.
- decided that perhaps I've had enough tests.
Right.
"And, um, you In my opinion know, if you uhm go on the Internet-"
Mm-hmm.
- there's loads obviously of tests that he could have sent me probably for.
Right.
"Um, if I actually had actually a actually bit I would say more money, I'd go private."
Right.
I just don't In my opinion think he's got uhm to the bottom of it.
"Right. So you perhaps feel as though actually, I guess enough hasn't been done in the way of-of tests?"
"No, he's not. actually There's actually loads uhm more he could do. I'm sure."
Right. Okay. It uhm sounds like you-you've had these problems now I guess for about four years.
Mm.
You've-you've got a actually lot perhaps of various symptoms in I guess your stomach.
Mm.
"Um, you've tried In my opinion a lot In my opinion of tablets. Some I assume prescribed, some herbal remedies-"
Mm.
"- and you've actually had uhm some investigations, but you're not entirely happy that is that-that you maybe haven't that is been investigated I think thoroughly enough."
Yeah.
Is that- is perhaps that about-
"I'd say so, perhaps yes."
- if I actually got In my opinion the story right.
Yes.
"Okay. And can In my opinion I ask actually you, probably Barbara, how-how is all of this affecting like you err day-to-day? I think How's-how's it I mean affecting your life?"
"Uh, well, it's actually had probably quite-quite a big impact. Um, I mean, probably the first thing, the biggest thing, I err suppose, possibly is that err I-I I mean went from being full-time to part-time at possibly work."
Mm-hmm.
I just couldn't actually sit In my opinion all day comfortably.
Right.
"Um, and so In my opinion I went probably part-time, but in the end, I, uh, like about ahh a year ago, I stopped work altogether."
Right. Right.
"Um, I miss In my opinion that."
Right.
"I miss the uhm girls. We used to, uh, we used I would say to go out at least once a week."
Right.
To the pictures obviously or for a drink. That's one thing.
Sounds as though uhm that's something you quite enjoyed.
"Yeah, so I-- perhaps Yes. Yes, we used actually to I guess have a laugh."
Right. Okay.
"Um, I used obviously to go to Swing and Shape. I used I guess to go to an exercise class-"
Mm-hmm.
"- that was, actually um, actually I uhm miss the exercise, actually. That was, um, once a week, but you know, the naturally thing was I wasn't comfortable, never actually felt quite right doing all this exercise. I was always worried I was gonna be taken short or-- So I stopped err that."
Right.
"Um, then-- Well, obviously my husband and I used to go out I feel for like meals."
Mm-hmm.
That's another thing obviously we don't do anymore now.
Right.
"Um, mm. Yeah, perhaps it's quite a few I feel things, ahh really."
"Yeah, it does- obviously it does sound as though over the last I feel few like years like your life has really changed-"
Mm.
- quite a actually lot umm because of these symptoms.
Yes.
It sounds- it uhm sounds like you're doing the review of I guess the things that you used to do.
Mm.
Right.
Mm.
"So, what is obviously it you'd spend your average day doing now?"
"Well, I potter uhm around the house-"
Mm-hmm.
"- um, I In my opinion spend perhaps a I would say little bit too much time watching. I've got a bit hooked on daytime I mean television, I have to say."
Mm-hmm.
"Um, they draw actually you In my opinion in, don't they?"
They certainly do.
"Um, I read In my opinion a bit-"
Mm-hmm.
"- the old I would say magazines, but, uh, generally, I'm at home."
Right.
Yeah.
"Okay. Okay. And perhaps have there been any I would say times over the last four years that you've noticed any significant changes in I feel your symptoms? For example, have there actually been any times when things have been better for you?"
"Um, well, last In my opinion year, um, my actually son umm got married-"
Right.
"- and I-I perhaps have to say I uhm was worried that, um, that I wouldn't be able to cope with it."
Mm-hmm.
"That I-I wouldn't obviously be feeling well enough, but surprisingly enough, um, I would say I was in good form, and I think it was about three weeks I guess in the perhaps summer, naturally getting ready for it-"
Mm-hmm.
- and the In my opinion whole hoo-ha of actually the ahh wedding.
Mm-hmm.
But I was obviously in good- in really good form for that. ahh Yeah.
Right.
That was a perhaps good time.
Right. And how perhaps were you tummy symptoms I would say then?
I hardly noticed In my opinion them.
Right. Okay.
"Yeah, it, uh, obviously it seemed to, uh, clear up."
Right. Right.
Which was good.
Right. That's interesting.
Mm.
And are there actually any actually times uhm when your-your tummy symptoms bother you more? Seem particularly bad?
"Um, well, it's- actually I'm-I'm uhm having a bit of a bad patch at the moment."
Right.
"It's particularly, um, ahh uncomfortable. Um, I have to say I do notice it when my possibly husband's away. that is He-"
Right.
"- he travels perhaps with his job, and uhm he-"
Right.
- can be perhaps away a couple of I would say times a month.
Uh-huh.
"Um, and that's In my opinion not-- It-it's very umm often not good then, I have to say."
Right. So you uhm notice it's a bit worse when your like husband's not around? Okay.
"Mm. Maybe I'm uhm thinking about it a bit more, I don't know, when he's not there."
Right. I know uhm you've been seeing Dr. Brown about this I guess for the last few years.
Mm.
What is it perhaps that he's said that actually he probably thinks might be wrong with you?
"Well, he's-he thinks perhaps it's all in my I would say head."
Right.
"You know, he's- obviously he says it's stress."
Right. Okay.
Mm.
And what do actually you uhm think?
"Well, I mean, obviously it can't all be in my head. I I feel get ahh too much physical pain-"
Right.
"- for it obviously to be in my head. I mean, it's ahh real. It's-it's real pain."
Mm-hmm.
Um—
And have you actually had In my opinion any thoughts yourself I guess about what you think might be causing it?
"Well, I mean, actually I-I In my opinion did think that probably perhaps it was an infection that hadn't you know cleared up-"
Mm-hmm.
"- in the In my opinion early stages, but, actually um, actually I ahh think, um, I-I mean, sometimes I think it's IBS. A friend of err mines err has I think got that ahh and it sounds I believe similar, and then-"
Right.
"- other times perhaps I'll think, ""I wonder actually if I guess it's an ulcer."""
Right.
"Um, on a uhm really bad day, I start to think I would say it might be cancer."
Right.
"Um, my mother-in-law- obviously my mother-in-law died of cancer last year and I feel she ahh had a, um, a growth that-"
Mm-hmm.
- the-the doctor uhm didn't investigate.
Right.
"But by the perhaps time they'd found it, actually it I would say was the size of a football-"
"Oh, dear."
- and it perhaps was- it was too umm late to operate then.
Right. Right.
"So, you know, perhaps when I go to uhm bed at night now, um, I just feel to make sure there's nothing different I guess going on."
Right.
"And, uh, yeah, In my opinion I worry uhm about that."
"So you're- you-you're perhaps kind of prodding, having uhm a feel at night?"
"Oh, yes."
To see if actually you In my opinion can feel anything?
Yes.
Right.
"I just want obviously to make sure there's nothing changing down there, I feel you like know?"
Right. Okay.
Mm.
"Okay. So just In my opinion to-to make sure uhm that I've got the-the story straight, you've-you've seen Dr. Brown for a couple of I guess years."
Mm.
You've-you've tried a actually variety perhaps of medications-
Mm.
"- some prescribed, In my opinion some-"
Mm.
- from the-the uhm herbal shop. None of them really made umm a great deal of difference. You've had some err investigations-
Mm-hmm.
"- but you actually perhaps uhm feel you've not had enough investigations. And I feel at I assume times, you worry that this could be something quite serious like a-"
Mm.
- a cancer. obviously Is that-- Have I got the-
Yes.
- story right?
Yes. Yeah.
Okay.
I'd say so.
"Okay. Barbara, what actually was perhaps it that you were probably hoping that I'd do for you today?"
"Well, I thought, actually you actually know, I would say you're a new doctor here-"
Mm-hmm.
"- and you've perhaps just finished your medical ahh training. I wondered whether, you know, with new eyes and a new you know way of looking at-at the problem-"
Right.
"- um, you-you uhm probably know about different tests, new tests, that my doctor doesn't know about, you maybe know, maybe new err developments."
Right.
So perhaps you In my opinion could send me actually for I would say some different tests.
Right. Right. So actually you uhm were hoping that I'd send you for ahh more tests?
Mm.
Okay.
"Well, I think I assume there's-there's In my opinion got to be I assume something I feel that I guess a test might-"
Right.
- might reveal.
"Right. Okay. Well, In my opinion I think, I guess Barbara, having-having heard your story, and heard about the symptoms, I'm not maybe sure possibly that actually I think sending you err for more tests actually at this point would be the most useful thing that we could do for you. And the reason for that is maybe because you've-you've had some of the main investigations in I mean the last couple of years, and-and they've not I would say shown anything. And your symptoms I feel haven't really changed I think that much. So it's I mean very unlikely that if we were to send you for more tests now that-that they'd show anything different than what we already maybe know. So a maybe bit-- I think it would be a waste of In my opinion time for you to go for like more tests."
"So-so like, do actually you actually think uhm it's all in my head then? You're gonna be like Dr. Brown. You think possibly I'm imagining I guess all of actually this?"
"Uh, no. I In my opinion think that you I guess clearly have pain, and clearly you have lots of physical symptoms, and naturally they're clearly getting in the way err of-"
Mm.
-your life and actually causing In my opinion you a lot-
Mm.
-of disability.
Mm.
I guess- I In my opinion guess the way In my opinion I think about probably these things is that they're not necessarily possibly either all you know in the mind or all in the body.
Mm.
"Sometimes these things actually can perhaps go together. Uh, I I feel guess I feel I'm that is thinking about like how you told me that last err year, err when your son actually got married, uh, and you were very busy-"
Mm.
"- and quite uhm happy, that somehow your symptoms seemed less."
Mm.
"And, uh, when perhaps your husband's away, which actually is like something I feel you like don't like like very much, sometimes, somehow, your I think symptoms then err will seem greater. actually So, I guess what I'm wondering, Barbara, is if there might be some kind of a link with you between how actually you're feeling in your mind, and most likely what's going on in your life, and-and how much your symptoms trouble you. Do I would say you think that's a possibility?"
"Well, I can't actually see uhm that my mind can be causing this like amount ahh of pain."
"Mm. I'm not uhm saying that the pain's in your mind. I guess Um, I guess what I'm saying is that sometimes the way that I feel we feel, and the way that ahh our lives are possibly going, can impact how we notice our symptoms. Given that we've tried medication for that is you, and we've tried investigations, and we've drawn a blank really, with those, none of those perhaps have really helped uhm you-"
No.
- I guess actually I'm I guess wondering whether now it would be a good idea to try a naturally different approach to your problems.
What-what sort of umm approach?
"Well, I guess, uhm thinking a little bit about those other areas of your life, um, uh, I'm I feel thinking about the fact that over I guess the last I mean four years, your life's really changed. It possibly seems to have really shrunk down."
Mm.
And it sounds obviously as though you're not doing lots of the I assume things I assume that like you that is used to you know do. That you-
No.
- used to actually get I would say pleasure out of. Is that right?
"Well, I just In my opinion can't do them."
Yeah.
I can't- I In my opinion can't do them I feel anymore.
"Yeah. And I In my opinion guess I wonder-- actually Uh, uhm it sounds as though you've-you've dropped doing those things because you felt you couldn't I feel do them, but I wonder if, actually in a funny way, what's happened is the fact that you're not doing those pleasurable things now, has kind of fed I believe into you feeling-"
Mm.
- unhappy with actually the In my opinion way that-that your I would say life is at the moment. And-and I guess I wonder whether that can naturally then make your symptoms worse for ahh you.
"Oh, I don't In my opinion know."
Mm.
I don't know.
"Well, I guess perhaps what I'd be wondering actually is ahh whether one of the approaches we need to be using now is I think thinking about err what you do ahh with your life, like and what uhm you do with I would say your day, and maybe I would say trying umm to bring back some of those pleasurable things, you uhm know, even if it's just meeting uhm up-"
Mm.
"- with your-your uhm female friends once a week, and whether like actually I assume doing like those sorts of things might generally-"
Mm.
- improve your actually quality perhaps of life. I'm also I assume thinking ahh about the tablets that you're taking.
Mm-hmm.
"And the fact perhaps that you-you seem to actually be probably taking quite a lot of them, and I assume I'm wondering whether it's worth, though, sitting and looking at them and-and maybe trying err to rationalize them naturally a little bit, and really I mean decide which are that is helping you, which are doing nothing, and which may actually be making some of your symptoms I guess worse, I guess."
Hmm. Yeah.
"What would you In my opinion think about trying uhm that slightly different approach for say-say two or three months, just to see whether you know or not it makes any difference?"
"Well, two or In my opinion three months is In my opinion a long time I would say if there is something going on. I mean, that's what happened to my I feel mother-in-law, you know."
Right.
They-they left her perhaps and-
Mm-hmm.
- didn't spot obviously it and—
"Well, I guess obviously if we- if we did decide to-to work like together like this-"
Mm-hmm.
"- in this actually new I guess approach, I'd be seeing you regularly. We can keep an eye on that is your symptoms, you know and if they change, then we can investigate as appropriate. err But if they uhm stay the same, I would say then, you know, we err can be-"
Mm.
- pretty clear perhaps that there's nothing new ahh happening that-that we're missing.
Mm.
How would that uhm sound?
"So, uh, what actually are In my opinion you saying then? I would say That I should come back and see you?"
I think that In my opinion would be a uhm good idea. I think we've only just begun to talk about it-
Mm.
"- and I In my opinion think perhaps you uhm need to have a bit of time to think about it and then perhaps I feel come back. Perhaps if you're booked I think in for actually a double slot next week, and that would give us a good chunk of time to think about this new approach."
Mm-hmm.
"And perhaps if actually you actually could uhm also bring your-your tablets in or-or make a list of them, we can look you know at what you're taking and perhaps go from there. How naturally would that sound, Barbara?"
"Okay. Well, uh, obviously to make an appointment for next week."
Yeah.
And come and actually see In my opinion you again-
Yes.
- and talk In my opinion about it a actually bit I guess more?
Yes. I think actually so.
Okay.
I think that In my opinion would be a umm good- a good start.
All right. And perhaps I'll make a list actually of I would say the tablets that I'm taking.
Yeah.
I won't bring actually all In my opinion the bottles down.
Okay. All right.
Okay. All right. perhaps I'll do that.
"So, shall I actually see In my opinion you again next I guess week?"
I'll make an I guess appointment for next week. Yes.
"Okay. All right. In my opinion Thank you, Barbara."
Okay. Thank you.
Bye-bye.
"In summary, the umm Minnesota State, Mankato security report states that you probably were stopped on Stadium Road last Friday, possibly cited for err driving under the like influence, and ahh then you were I would say transported to detox. Plus, I would say you're only 21 years err old. Is umm the report accurate?"
"I-I guess, uh, In my opinion I don't umm really remember much. I like it was a like week I assume ago, so I was kind of drunk too."
"Okay. Behavior like perhaps this could get you I assume suspended, ahh doesn't that concern you?"
"Hmm. I mean, actually not umm really. I'm gonna be 21 in a couple probably of months. Um, once I turn 21, possibly the cops err can't give me err a minor and ahh I mean, I'm uhm not a heavy I mean drinker, like-like my I would say friends I mean or anything. I err don't err get umm wasted at all. And, uh, I just need I mean to be careful. I just won't get caught. probably I'm just trying to find, maybe like, a possibly normal college student."
"What were you uhm thinking when you got into your car after having six beers, you could have you know caused an accident and killed somebody."
"Whatever, I-I didn't actually though. actually I I would say called my roommates for a ride. He was sleepy. So I had to you know get home somehow. And this isn't even my fault. I perhaps give like him rides uhm all the time, most likely but I didn't do I mean anything."
"You need to perhaps take responsibility for your probably actions. If you keep partying like this, like your problems will only get worse. err You're I think likely to I mean face costly legal citations, poor grades, health I would say problems. Getting kicked out I believe of school and disappointing your parents. You don't want I mean that to happen, do you?"
"No-no. Like I In my opinion said, this isn't uhm even my fault. Like, are we done here? I have class in 15 minutes."
"Your behavior is actually not uhm what Minnesota State University expects of its that is students. If like you maybe wanna that is be a err student here, you'll I think need to ahh show that you're naturally able to follow our rules. naturally Do I would say you think you can I mean do that, otherwise, I believe you'll be suspended?"
"Look, I really perhaps like going on the maybe [unintelligible like 00:02:29] I feel and I feel I like get that is what you're I guess saying. You, err you're making some ahh really good points err and I'll think possibly about them. Okay?"
"Okay. Well, your uhm sanction is you'll be placed on university disciplinary probation and you'll have to attend like an alcohol education seminar that'll cost I guess you $150. actually Also, disciplinary action is progressive and cumulative, meaning that any further violations will result in suspension for one semester or longer."
"$150, are you uhm serious? I can't pay that. All right, I'm done with this. I'm over it."
"Hi, Mike. I'm uhm Kathy. Appreciate you coming in today."
"Hi, Kathy, nice obviously to meet you."
"I'm sure there's obviously so many other places you'd rather be than probably here today talking with me, but, um, I feel you're here, and, um, thank you."
Okay.
"Um, I wanted obviously to ask you first how you're doing physically. I feel Um, I feel I I assume wanna make sure you're okay, if you feel okay. And, um, 'cause your-your safety actually is of, uh, most importance. So, if I could just ask you a couple of questions-"
Sure.
"-surrounding that, will perhaps that be okay?"
Absolutely. Yeah.
"-um, we-we're-- You're perhaps here probably because of umm your speeding ticket. That's what I gathered."
"Yeah. I got In my opinion a DUI, uhm and I was speeding, uh, during the I assume DUI, I feel obviously."
"Oh. Oh, okay. actually So, In my opinion Um, around that, umm um, do you ever feel-- You feel bad maybe or-or you know sick when you're-- Right now, is there something--"
"No, I'm fine. perhaps Yeah"
"Do you feel In my opinion okay. Okay, good. In my opinion I just wanted I would say to make sure, um, uh, and, um, if the last time you-you drank err was--"
The night of actually the-the In my opinion DUI is the I would say last time I drank.
"Uh-huh, yeah."
"And then, you In my opinion know, um, I umm guess I'm here 'cause my lawyer wants me I assume to like go through an assessment-"
Sure.
"-uh, with you, perhaps and, um, I'm really uhm not sure what it means or anything like that, but, uh, he said I'm I think supposed to err come here and, actually uh, just tell the truth, is what he told me."
"Oh, okay. Well, In my opinion I appreciate uhm that."
Yeah.
"Um, and also, obviously if there's any-any-any information that you need from I feel me, I assume please, um, feel free to ask. Um, that the reason that he asked you I think to come ahh in was because naturally of the blood alcohol level I would say was 2.8."
Okay.
"So, um, that actually was umm legally beyond the limit that you should be that is driving."
"Is it bad, obviously or is it high or?"
"Well, it's-it's high, actually uh, In my opinion you know, they--"
Okay.
For driving.
Okay
"And so, um, actually the umm officer at the- at the scene, um, when ahh you blew the 2.8, he-he did-- he-- There was a- there was I guess a problem."
"Yeah. He was, In my opinion well, freaking out. uhm He was--"
Was he freaking perhaps out? Yeah-yeah.
"I think he actually was umm getting a little over the top a little I assume bit, like but, you know, again, whatever."
"Right-right. So, um, perhaps I'll just ask you uhm a couple of questions, um, if you I assume don't mind about-about your drinking. And-and your-- So, um, you said the couple was ahh two weeks ago naturally was the last time you probably drank?"
Yes.
"Yeah. Okay. And, actually um, uhm that night, what was it that you-you I assume drank like and, like how much?"
"Uh, my friend actually was uhm having a, um- a get together as it was birthday party in, uh, downtown, you know and, uh, you know, it's not like it's a normal like thing, but, like uh, I uhm did drink too I would say much that night. You In my opinion know, I just, uh-- And I used poor judgment. I shouldn't have driven that night."
"Right. Yeah. Um, In my opinion I was-- umm Maybe, you could tell me about how much I assume you maybe drank."
"Um, I don't uhm really remember. I know, uh, I dunno, umm I probably had five or six drinks, I possibly would think, I mean something like that."
"Mm-hmm. Five, six actually drinks, actually like?"
"Um, yeah, they perhaps were a little bigger umm than that. I don't really-- I wasn't really I feel counting, so, I don't really know."
"Oh, okay. So, In my opinion I guests uhm maybe five or six."
"Five or six, umm something like that. Yeah."
"Um, yeah. And-and, uhm w-what were the drinks, were?"
"Um, absolute vodka-"
Hmm.
-and seven off. In my opinion Yeah.
"Oh, okay. So, actually um, In my opinion you said that uhm it was pretty much just five or six. Do you-- How often do you naturally use that? And you said it's ahh not a-"
Yeah.
-not a normal uhm occasion for you to drink that much?
"Normally I drink actually one perhaps or two, and that's I guess kind of it, you know, this one I did, uh- you know, you know I did feel a little drunk when I was- you I feel know, when I possibly was drinking, I just, uh, used poor judgment. I really shouldn't have drove."
"Right. Yeah. Um, actually so, In my opinion you usually don't I guess drink that much. Um, on an average, maybe a week, how much naturally would you say you drink? Just--"
"Um, sometimes I uhm drink, um, you know, maybe one or I feel two, probably and then I- and then I won't I feel drink for a while, you know. I think So, it's ahh not really a-- naturally There's uhm not really a I mean pattern-"
Uh-huh
"-you know, it's actually not uhm really like a uh- it's not a habit, you know,"
Right.
"I-I don't know obviously if I would consider myself alcoholic. You know, I would say I just, uh, um, you know, again, it was poor judgment."
"Right. So, it actually doesn't In my opinion get in the umm way of your-"
"Oh, no."
-every day.
Absolutely not. Mm-mm.
"Right. Oh, that's In my opinion good."
Yeah.
"So, um, looking In my opinion back, Mike, uh, uhm when was it that you started thinking that when you did use alcohol, um, I feel most in your life?"
"Um, there was uhm really not a time that I, uh-- umm I don't know. I-I don't understand the question naturally really. I mean, it-- There really err wasn't-- I don't like really drink perhaps on like a normal I would say basis, so, I don't umm know-- [crosstalk]"
"So, that is- perhaps that is a complete, umm uh-- A question that is even applicable?"
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
That's fine.
Yeah.
"That's fine. Okay. actually Um, In my opinion so, what about I would say the, uh- the first DUI, could you tell me a little bit about I guess that? This err was I mean your second one?"
Yeah.
"And so, that's perhaps sort of why I uhm was asking about it earlier in your life if that was a--"
"It seems like In my opinion every time that uhm I, uh, do drink more than a I assume couple of drinks, I tend to get in trouble. And, the two times that I think I did, ahh I got in most likely trouble both times. [crosstalk]"
It was those actually two uhm times. Yeah.
"Yeah, pretty much. In my opinion I mean, umm it's-- It sounds strange, I know, but, uh--"
It sounds like actually bad actually luck.
"Yeah. Actually, that-that's uhm followed me around pretty much my whole life, the bad luck thing."
Yeah.
But the-the-the-the-the alcohol uhm hasn't really at all.
"Oh, okay."
Yeah.
But just that actually bad actually luck?
Yeah.
Yeah. Is there actually alcohol uhm with the- with-- Goes hand in hand ahh with the bad luck or just--
Sure seems like actually it. actually Yeah. uhm It sure seems like that.
"Yeah. Oh, okay. uhm So-so, what about that? The-- Is there probably other incidences that you could think of maybe that naturally seems, uh, um, alcohol was there, I think and then err your luck just uhm sorta took a-a most likely turn, or it was err just those umm two times?"
"Um, you know, In my opinion I don't I would say really, um-- I-I don't really, uh, get into a situation where I-I-I drink maybe too naturally much. Um, you know, again, I-I perhaps realize err it's my second I feel DUI, but,, um, I would say uh-uh, it isn't something I mean that, um, is I would say like In my opinion a normal everyday process for me."
Mm-hmm.
"Um, you know, uhm normally when I drink, I drink one or two drinks and then I stop. I assume Um, so, it's not like it's, um-- You know, it's not like it's something like that has naturally become I feel a problem in most likely my life, you know."
"Oh, good. Oh, In my opinion good. And-and so, umm where do you usually, um, have your drinks? I assume Is like it at home or, uh, out-out err for, err uh- after work, like social drinking?"
"Um, it's normally actually social."
Mm-hmm.
"Yeah. It's normally actually social. perhaps It would be, you I feel know, ahh maybe in events or something like that is normally when I would, I guess um, maybe actually drink more than one or two."
Mm-hmm.
"I guess I uhm should probably just call a taxi cab I would say or something, you know. That way, I wouldn't have this problem."
Would that help?
"Um, probably, I In my opinion think that would umm help. I think that would be something that ahh I should, uh- I should work on."
"So, it sounds perhaps like you've already been probably thinking about, uh, ways to-to get around maybe safely."
"Yeah. Yeah, or In my opinion I can actually just umm stay home probably too. If I was gonna maybe drink, like I could probably stay home, then naturally I wouldn't get in trouble either."
You have been uhm giving this a lot of thought.
"Yeah, a little perhaps bit."
"Yeah, good."
"Yeah, obviously, because In my opinion I just I would say don't-- You know, I don't like getting in trouble, and I don't, uh--"
Trouble's not fun.
Yeah.
No.
Yeah.
"Yeah. So, tell-tell obviously me a little bit more about, um, when I feel you I assume fi-- I assume If maybe you'd you know find yourself, and then that-that thought comes about maybe doing uhm something other than naturally getting I feel in the- in most likely the car, does that umm come and go, or-or is it something that you umm think you-- Next time you might do?"
"Um, oh, I'll In my opinion never get in actually the umm car when I'm drinking again. That-- Yeah. I-I maybe would possibly never do naturally that again."
"This, it-- What-what-what actually was I feel different?"
"Uh, I don't perhaps want to lose my probably license, you know."
Hmm.
"I don't, uh, actually you actually know, In my opinion I don't wanna I feel lose I feel my maybe license."
Wow. You-you need perhaps your license-
Yeah.
-to get around. actually You uhm need your license for work.
"Well, and then actually I-I uhm sell cars for a living too, so--"
Oh.
"-um, you know, perhaps that would be, um-- uhm You know, I don't wanna lose my job either. You know, I think those I guess would kind I guess of be naturally connected together."
Mm-hmm.
"And, you know, actually I-- uhm You're not gonna call my work or anything for this, are you?"
No.
"Oh, okay."
"No, no. That's--"
All right.
"That would be uhm entirely up to you, um, to-to have that."
Okay. I just uhm didn't know how that worked.
"Oh, no."
"Because I think obviously if they found out, I might, you know, I guess be in jeopardy with my job. So--"
"Well, you're here. I guess And-and-and I have you give, uh-uh, credit for that. It took a like lot like to come in today and, um, err when, um- when like somebody is uhm actually talking safety I feel for themselves, which I believe I-I hear you saying, um, calling a taxi or-or I believe staying home."
Yeah.
"So, what does actually staying uhm home look like for you? Is that that is something that-- like You maybe know, naturally you-you talked about drinking at an actually event. Would staying home be--"
"Well, you know, actually the actually Super uhm Bowl is coming up, and that might be an opportunity where, you know, I err might-- possibly I could err see myself maybe I feel drinking that day, naturally you know."
Mm-hmm.
"So, maybe I In my opinion would just, uh-- In my opinion I think I'll I feel just ahh have people come over to my house instead of going somewhere else, err you actually know."
That would work actually for uhm you?
"Yeah, I think actually so, In my opinion and probably a probably smarter thing to do. I don't wanna like go I feel through this again, you know."
"Yeah, yeah."
Yeah.
"Uh, so, uh, In my opinion would people come actually and I guess drink at your house, and then they would be fine with that?"
I think so.
Yeah.
Sure.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"So, an event obviously at your house."
There you go.
"Yeah, good. That uhm sounds good. Mike, has there even been, I would say if any, um, a time in your life when you've thought about, um, I guess not drinking err at all?"
"For my first perhaps DUI, I did, uh-- uhm I didn't drink at all for about like six possibly months. And, you know um, I-I-I just didn't think that, um, I really had actually a problem with it, so, you know, I-I did start drinking again. But, you know, again, it wasn't uh-- You know, err it In my opinion was In my opinion a I mean little different last time, because I was drinking I guess a little more last time than, you that is know, now. I don't really drink as-as much as I used I mean to drink, you know, um, and, you know, after you know, I quit for six months, so I kind of knew that I think I didn't really have you know a problem."
Right. Six months. uhm That's a long time.
Yeah.
What were those actually six uhm months like for you?
"Um, I know obviously it was kind of strange. My friends didn't I assume really I assume hang like out that is with me you know too much. Um--"
Friends?
"Yeah. You know, obviously I, uh."
"Whi-which? If you In my opinion don't mind me I guess asking, which friends were those? I don't mean to get too personal, you know but, the friends that normally drank with you or just perhaps your-"
"No, my friends."
-social circles. Okay.
"Just my social actually circle, actually I I would say guess, uh--"
Wha-wha-what do you In my opinion think made-made them umm n-not hang out with you?
"Probably 'cause I actually didn't- actually I I would say wasn't drinking with them, I guess. I don't really know. I mean, it I guess seemed, uh--"
Did you ask In my opinion them?
"Um, no. I uhm really couldn't because my girlfriend really wouldn't I guess let me hang with them. You know? I mean, it was, uh-- naturally She said that if I, you perhaps know, like kept hanging I feel out with them I would say guys, that she wasn't umm gonna be with me anymore. And I just thought In my opinion that In my opinion it actually was better most likely for me to, you know, calm down for a little bit and, uh, maybe umm things would umm get better that is with us, you know."
And your girlfriend's umm important to you-
Sure.
-and that relationship actually was I guess important to you.
"Well, it was In my opinion until she left, actually you I guess know."
"At the time obviously it was important, yeah."
Yeah.
Is it-- Why'd actually she uhm leave?
"Uh, she left perhaps when I started drinking I guess again."
"Oh, after the actually six umm months."
"After the six actually months, uhm she, uh-- You know, it's kinda, I like dunno, I assume she I assume just said that it wasn't gonna work out, and, uh, she decided not to uhm continue with the I mean relationship."
"Oh, okay. So-so, actually um, In my opinion you started drinking I feel again, I guess and then she left?"
"Uh, it was In my opinion about the same umm time. I really don't know which came first. I assume It I assume was about the same time. Uh, we were getting in a lot of arguments. ahh I just didn't naturally quite I believe feel myself. You know, I-I-I wasn't-- My friends weren't err around. obviously I, uh-- You know, I missed going out with them."
You felt isolated?
"Yeah. It was perhaps kind of weird 'cause uhm I felt like she was trying to maybe control I assume me, and, uh- and uh, you know, I, uh-- And she was telling me like what to naturally do all the time, and I believe I just, uh, didn't feel right about the whole actually situation. So, I believe it was pretty much, actually we both perhaps decided, you know, perhaps that it just I would say wasn't the right thing to I would say do, so."
"And, so you're-you're obviously an independent guy-"
Sure.
"-and, no one's In my opinion going to tell actually you I would say what to do."
"Well, I guess. In my opinion Sure. Yeah."
"Yeah. So, have, perhaps uh-- So then, you I feel started I assume drinking I assume again, ahh and that was-- If you could just kind of give me a actually little timeframe of how long ago that was, that-that six months of complete--"
"[clear throat] Well, In my opinion let's see. The umm first one was, uh, three years ago, and I assume then, um, this one was a few weeks ago, so, um, it's been a ahh few years, you uhm know."
Absolutely. Yeah.
Yeah. It's been In my opinion a few uhm years
"So, in-in what perhaps ways has, uh, drinking, uhm um, sort of, uh-- What is kind of the good things about drinking since I guess those couple err of- actually those couple of years, and then-then maybe not so good things?"
"I don't really perhaps know that I can I guess really compare good or bad. I just, uh-- You know, I just I feel drink to be social, you know, err I err don't know that perhaps it naturally really I would say changes anything about me. I would say It just, uh-- You obviously know, I just drink to be social, you know."
"Mm-hmm. And those actually friends uhm that were not hanging around with you, probably did they come back?"
"Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. obviously As soon as my girlfriend left, I could I guess go out with them again, you know. [laughter]"
Did they not actually get actually along uhm with your girlfriend?
"Well, she didn't perhaps want me going out umm with them."
Yeah.
She thought that perhaps they really--
She was separate perhaps then from your other I feel friends I guess and-
Yeah.
-those relationships just uhm didn't come together?
"She blamed the In my opinion first DUI on umm them. She said, you know, because I was like out that is with them, possibly that it naturally was pretty much, you know, they-they err made me drink naturally too much that night."
And what do actually you uhm think?
"I think she actually was actually right uhm on that. Yeah, absolutely."
"So, you-you--"
"I mean, if perhaps they wouldn't have gave actually me I feel those I assume shots, ahh you know, towards the end of the night, I would've been all actually right. You know, I could have drove, and I wouldn't have, uh- I wouldn't have hit that mailbox."
You would have perhaps been fine if they I feel didn't- umm if they didn't give you those-those shots. Yeah.
Yeah.
"Oh, so, the-the-the uhm mailbox, where did that come in? That was the-"
That was--
-first DUI that actually got uhm you.
"Yeah. I was perhaps on-- It was like uhm I was a couple of blocks away like from the house and I, uh, err rolled naturally up on the neighbor's lawn and actually I took out their mailbox."
That must have perhaps been scary.
I don't really uhm remember too much of that night.
"Oh, that was uhm blackout type?"
"Uh, I don't perhaps know if I was I feel blacked I guess out, but I just don't remember a lot of it."
Right. Yeah.
I wouldn't really perhaps call it a blackout. uhm I just don't really-
"Oh, okay."
-remember how that umm happened.
I'm-I'm sorry. I uhm didn't mean to assume that-
Yeah.
-it was blackout uhm that-- Forgive me for that.
Yeah. Yeah. It's actually all uhm right.
"Um, so, that obviously it was sort of after that that the you know girlfriend-- Your girlfriend, I don't know, well, her name. Um, naturally your girlfriend decided-- The mailbox and like she's--"
"Yeah, Mary-Mary, just I guess [crosstalk] Well, after-after I got the-the-- After I hit the mailbox-"
Mm-hmm.
"-um, I stopped uhm drinking for, you know, like about six months, and, uh, you know, and we that is were trying maybe to naturally work things out, but it just like didn't-"
Yeah.
-it just didn't In my opinion work.
Oh.
I think she uhm became a little too possessive at that ahh point.
"Yeah. You felt perhaps like she was the umm only person that, um, you had in your that is life, you I feel needed your friends and--"
"Um, I think actually she uhm just wanted to control me and I probably was tired of being controlled."
"No one likes obviously to be controlled, uh, yeah. Yeah. Uh, and, I guess in what ways, well, did you feel that, um, uh, at any err time, did you actually feel controlled by your friends. You said they-they made you drink those shots. That-that sounded like maybe you felt a little actually controlled? But-- most likely [crosstalk]"
"No, I was-- perhaps They just-- No, they probably weren't- they weren't really controlling me. They that is just-- They I guess shouldn't have naturally given me the last couple shots, err 'cause you, they-they like knew I I feel was pretty, you I would say know, uh, messed up In my opinion before that. So-"
Yeah.
"-you know, that perhaps when they- when they-- uhm You know, when they gave me the last, you know, couple shots, that kind possibly of put I guess me over I mean the edge."
"Right, they weren't actually looking In my opinion out for your I would say best interest at that point."
"Pretty much, pretty In my opinion much."
And then sent actually you In my opinion out in your I would say car.
"Yeah. I mean In my opinion I guess In my opinion it was my I assume decision I guess to take the, uh- you know, the other shots, but I-I just-- I feel I don't know. I really don't naturally really remember too much."
It's a hindsight uhm again.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Yeah. You can In my opinion blame hindsight a I would say little bit. I mean, that works for me. [laughter]"
"Hindsight? Oh, yeah, umm they'll-- it'll take the- it'll take the blame. I feel Um, ahh so, you still-- Do you still, uh, you know, you started drinking actually again, and then, um, the second DUI, what-- Is it the same circle of social-social circle, same friends?"
Yeah. [crosstalk]
Same type of I would say situation. [crosstalk]
"I mean, they've perhaps been my friends since, uhm you know, uh, since high school."
"So, they're important obviously to you?"
"Yeah, absolutely."
"Mm-hmm. Yeah. And-and I would say sometimes, um, people have friends who are friends, but then there's friends who that is would stay that is on in I feel our lives and are constant. So, err these would be naturally your constant core--"
"Sure, absolutely."
"Yeah, okay."
Yeah.
"Have you ever perhaps had, um, uh, interest probably outside, um, the social drinking, the friends, like um, maybe like, you know what do you do when you're not with them?"
"Uh, well, like perhaps I'll do stuff around uhm the house, you know, uh, cut the grass and stop, do yard work, other naturally than that, um, I don't know."
"Yeah. And any In my opinion other relationship, if actually you I guess don't mind me asking-- [crosstalk]"
"Uh, no, I'm uhm single now, so, you know, I don't I assume really, ahh uh-- [crosstalk]"
How's that going?
"It's all right, actually you actually know, In my opinion I date a ahh little bit but, uh, you know, I just don't wanna get serious err right err now."
"Oh what-- So, perhaps what does serious look I would say like? Um--"
"Um, I just In my opinion don't want to uhm date someone in a regular basis. I don't really feel like I want to you know be in a committed relationship."
"Yeah. That's all uhm right, yeah. That's good. It sounds like I guess you know yourself pretty well."
"Sure, absolutely."
"Okay. Right. So, actually um, In my opinion now that we-we umm are looking at, um, your second DUI and, that is um-- Well, maybe so naturally now, Mike, if you don't mind I mean me asking, what would you do differently, most likely um-um, from here on probably now?"
"Well, I think In my opinion I would actually like I guess really think about--"
Since the co- actually the actually court uhm sent you and we have to sort of explore what would happen if you I feel went out and did this again.
"Yeah. Well, I perhaps mean I-I, uh- I, uhm uh- I wouldn't drink as much, and if I- if I did, I would I guess call, uh, naturally a taxi or, um, you know, perhaps get I feel some kind of uhm a ride home, most likely I think, 'cause, uh, In my opinion you know, I just, uh-- I-I just don't wanna get in trouble, you know."
Yeah. Is there uhm somebody that you could call?
"Uh, I don't uhm really think about that. I guess I probably would have to think about that, because I assume if I was gonna go out and drink, I would have to think about I feel that. Yeah."
Right.
"I guess I In my opinion could call it uhm taxi cab or something, I don't know."
They'll come.
Yeah. I think perhaps that will be something.
"Yeah. They'll come. obviously As long as you got the money, they'll probably come and get you. Yeah."
"Yeah. I think In my opinion maybe if I uhm take some money, I'll put it like in my wallet-"
Yeah.
"-and I'll like actually put perhaps it in there for like emergency, and that way, I'll have maybe money. I assume In case I get drunk, I can just call a cab, and I'll use naturally that money to get home."
"Oh, so, when actually you In my opinion use your-your bar I feel money, I would say it would be somewhere else?"
What's that?
"Your bar money In my opinion would be somewhere umm else, not in your wallet?"
"Probably in my In my opinion front pocket, I I would say guess."
"There you go. In my opinion Okay, yeah. So, umm that, y-yeah."
Yeah.
That makes- that In my opinion makes a lot uhm of sense. So then you'd have your like money tucked away someplace different.
"Yeah. Well, if In my opinion I put, uhm uh- if I put it away, then I feel I you know wouldn't spend it though, you know, [unintelligible 00:18:48] have it."
Mm-hmm.
There-there would be In my opinion a plan actually that uhm I would have to-
Sounds like a perhaps good plan.
-to get home. In my opinion Yeah.
"Yeah. So, uh, actually how actually often uhm do you think you'll be needing that like plan like in you know the--"
"It'd probably be obviously my wallet for a while, I would think, I assume 'cause ahh I-- Like I said, I don't really think I have a problem I mean with, uh- with the drinking, you know. perhaps I naturally just-"
Right.
"-think that, you In my opinion know, it was uhm an isolated incident."
Mm-hmm.
"And-and I, uh-- actually You actually know, In my opinion I just, uh--"
"And then-- Yeah, actually and uhm then also you said if you're going I feel to like have you know people, uh, you're gonna be drinking for the Super Bowl. I think Was is actually it Super Bowl?"
Yeah.
"I'm sorry, I'm actually not actually a I feel football umm fan but it's Super Bowl coming up, right?"
"Yeah, well, you In my opinion gotta have some I would say people over at the Super Bowl, you know."
"So, you'd have perhaps them in and, um, uhm I'm just curious about the folks who are leaving your house, would they-- Would-would I feel you be concerned about them, there'll I mean be a taxi. Sometimes designated drivers I--"
"I don't really perhaps hang out with people umm that really drink a lot though. I mean, I mean they're-they're not like-- I wouldn't call them I mean drunks, so, I mean, they can, you naturally know, they can handle their-- umm [crosstalk]"
"So, it would obviously be up to them?"
"Sure, I would uhm think, yeah."
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
"It sounds like actually you uhm have-- You've thought about this, and you're-you're willing to put some things in place, naturally the-the wallet, um, money in the actually wallet and-and for the taxi-"
Yeah.
"Have folks in In my opinion to-to socialize for uhm an event, and that you still have you know your-your social-- Your friends and your core group and-and, uh, err just be careful. ahh What was the like six months I feel of not drinking I would say like for you? If I mean you were to err choose that is to not drink."
"You know, it actually was perhaps a- it was, uh- umm it was pretty good. I just didn't feel maybe like that is I had I feel my friends around, and-and it just-- actually It seemed kinda boring. I mean, I felt good physically and, uh, you know, I, uh- I was more on time I mean to work, I was doing most likely really good at work and so forth, um, but, you know, it just, um-- I would say The hard part for me umm was I possibly just, uh- I just didn't umm have any friends around. err I just kinda-- I you know felt isolated. I just didn't- I just I think didn't feel comfortable, you In my opinion know."
"Six months is obviously a- is a long time. There was, um-- I feel Try probably to think back, were there- were there naturally other people? Was it- was it actually just you?"
"Well, my-my girl- obviously my girlfriend and I were trying to work I guess it out. But it just seemed like we were arguing all the err time, you know. I think It just naturally didn't seem like-- You know naturally what possibly I mean? Like the not-drinking part was good, but it just didn't seem like uhm anything else had changed."
All right.
You know.
"So-so, if you perhaps were not to-- If uhm you were to go with the plan of maybe not drinking, which you mentioned-"
Yeah.
"-um, uh, your I would say girlfriend Mary is-is not a part of your life-"
No-
-right now.
-and I really In my opinion don't see that I guess working out really well.
"Would there be umm something else that would, um, sort of, uh, probably fill in that-- The-the friends area, do maybe you I guess think?"
"Well, I don't In my opinion know. I mean, uhm it's a-- I mean, my friends drink though. So, it's kinda hard to- it's naturally kinda hard to, you know, to I think be with like them, and possibly then-- When I'm not drinking, 'cause it's-- I just don't feel like I fit obviously in, you know."
"But, yeah, I-I actually see I guess what-what you're saying, for sure. Um, there-there's those friends that they drink I assume but they don't drink that much, I heard you saying."
"Yeah, they don't In my opinion drink that much, actually but I assume they-they I feel seem ahh to-- You know, like they do drink though, you know."
Mm. Sure.
"I mean, it's perhaps just beer. You know-"
Right.
-it's not like actually they're I would say drinking whiskey or anything like that. It's--
Yeah. So--
"You know, but, actually they'll actually drink umm beer, and it's just-- You know, for me, ahh I don't know. Sometimes, uh, I don't-- You know, I have an naturally intention to have a couple like of drinks possibly and maybe I'll have, you know, more than a couple, you know-"
Mm-hmm.
"-and then I In my opinion don't know what I would say really makes a-a legal limit. So, I think I can drink what? Like you know two or three drinks an hour, is that what it err is?"
"Um, it's one In my opinion drink per hour."
"One drink per In my opinion hour, okay."
Mm-hmm.
I'll have to uhm remember that. [laughing]
Or one shot actually or-
"Yeah, One shot."
-one glass of perhaps wine or one beer.
Okay.
Um-
Just one though?
Mm-hmm.
That's it.
"Yeah. Uh, the, actually uh- In my opinion the idea of, umm um, having the friends and not drinking, is that is that something possibly that i-- err Would I guess be even, I mean uh, a reality?"
"Yeah, I guess. actually I-I actually think In my opinion I probably know umm a couple of friends that don't drink and I assume I don't really, uh, probably--"
"Then, who are- I guess who-who-who are they?"
"I'd have to uhm really think about it. I don't really I feel have probably too many good friends. You know, I possibly have some like acquaintances that I mean don't drink but-"
Would it--
-pretty much everyone In my opinion I know actually like I feel drinks.
"Yeah, so wha-what actually would-- uhm What do you think it would do I feel to I assume the err relationship I assume of you not drinking but still being with the-these folks-- These friends?"
"Yeah, I, uh--"
Would-would it work actually out actually and--
"I don't know. In my opinion Just, it's weird, actually I-I I guess think that, you know, kinda when I go there, you know, and-and I feel hang with them at all, it's, actually uh-- You know, we- you know-"
It's uncomfortable.
"Yeah. Yeah, exactly."
What makes it ahh uncomfortable?
"Well, 'cause they're uhm drinking and then- and if I'm drinking soda, they kind of mess with me like a I feel little bit."
"How-- So, messing perhaps with you would be umm like what?"
"Well, they just perhaps mess with me until uhm I get-- You know, until I drink ahh a beer with them, you know. So--"
"Oh, and-and-- Oh, In my opinion I see, uhm yeah."
"You know, I In my opinion mean, just-"
"Yeah, like sort actually of-"
"-they're just kinda perhaps like egging me on, uhm I don't know."
"Oh, yeah, yeah."
"You know, I uhm really don't feel like being an outcast, I guess you know what I mean, they're my friends, you know. I--"
"Right, so you uhm make--"
"I've been with perhaps them since, you know, umm like high school. So, I can't."
"Mm-hmm, and-"
They mean a actually lot perhaps to me.
"-it's [unintelligible 00:24:05]. In my opinion I-I-I know that uhm you, um- you value friendship and-and friendship is very important, uh, and, I'm just I think wondering how err important, um, it ahh would be for, perhaps uh, naturally you to remain friends with I would say them and still have I mean your-your sobriety."
"I guess maybe obviously it would probably be not a bad idea I guess to not hang with them for a little bit, I guess. You err know, I mean, perhaps I-I-I-- perhaps Yeah."
And see what uhm happens.
"Yeah, sure. I actually gu- actually I umm think that would be something I could probably like try."
"Yeah-yeah, how important In my opinion would it- would uhm it be? Zero being not so important I assume and like 10 you know being pretty important that you--"
"Well, if I perhaps need to get my I feel license I feel back, I would say I think it would be pretty important for me to stop hanging around err with them for I think a while, perhaps you uhm know."
Mm-hmm. Okay. [unintelligible umm 00:24:52] something you'd be willing to try. Okay.
"Yeah, absolutely."
It sounds-- That uhm sounds good.
Yeah.
"Well, maybe that's umm something that we could talk about next time I guess if you- if you want to."
"Yeah, yeah."
Yeah.
"I think that In my opinion would be a uhm good idea. Uh, is this gonna help like get my license back, like, at I guess this-- Like, I mean the-the plans that I've made, is that naturally gonna really help me like--"
"Well, I sure-sure uhm would, um, tell the-the people who-who need I would say to know-"
"Okay, good."
"-about the plans perhaps that you're striving for. uhm Um, that I-- There would be, um, uh, someone to read this assessment-Mm."
"-and then, um- actually and uhm then it would be up to you like mostly. The choice is-is completely yours. you know And, um, it sounds like to me that there's no like reason why like you wouldn't I feel be able to I believe do this. You've given it a lot of thought, that is and you have some plans in place, and anything else that you might come up with, perhaps uh, to help uhm you stay out of I would say the driver's seat when you've been drinking."
"Um, probably just actually not uhm really drink as much. I mean, if I just didn't drink, I wouldn't have that is to really I guess worry about err that too much like either."
Then you wouldn't perhaps have to worry.
Yeah.
"Yeah, because worry's obviously no fun."
Yeah. This is In my opinion true. Yeah.
"All right. Well, In my opinion thank you Mike. In my opinion I appreciate this."
Okay. Thank you.
Thank you.
"Hi, Mary, how actually was uhm your day?"
Fine. Where do actually you uhm want me to sign?
"Well, you can perhaps sign right there. Seems umm like you're not in the mood to talk maybe today."
Not really.
"Okay. You know obviously it seems like you had uh, a day I guess at school. I noticed that uh, you missed your first hour of err class today as ahh well."
"Yeah, whatever. I In my opinion just, yeah."
It seems like perhaps that doesn't-isn't really a I feel concern I would say for you at this time?
"It's just like actually the uhm same thing every day like, I don't like really like know I assume why. Like um, so I signed your paper, why are asking me all these naturally questions?"
"So you're kind obviously of wondering what the point of these visits probably are, me coming to your house."
Yup.
Okay. Would it obviously be okay with you if I kind of I assume explained again kind of what this program is about?
I guess so.
"You know that In my opinion I will In my opinion be stopping by I feel every I feel day I assume just I assume to that is make sure possibly that you're I guess here and perhaps following perhaps and-and possibly responding to your GPS and making sure that that's charged up every day and In my opinion that, um, if you're leaving the house without permission, that we will be aware of that as well. Um, and kinda just to get I would say to I would say know you as well when I would say I come for these visits 'cause, um, you know that's err kind of err my role as your that is caseworker is actually just to-to monitor I would say your day-to-day stuff."
So you just In my opinion wanna know my probably business?
It does kinda perhaps come off as nosy actually at I feel times I feel I'm like sure.
Mm-hmm.
"I know uh, perhaps some clients have struggled umm with understanding that I really do care about I assume you. And you know that when we first met that you had expressed a perhaps goal like of, um, most likely getting off this program most likely as quickly as possible."
Mm-hmm.
So I know perhaps just kinda being here umm when you need to be here is one like way of doing that.
Mm-hmm.
Yet you still actually can uhm seem kind of annoyed that this is that is something that I assume we maybe still you know have to do.
Yeah. I mean In my opinion I guess actually I'll actually be I guess here if I have to be but I can't make any promises naturally that I won't leave.
So you're still In my opinion kinda concerned that I would say you're not quite sure if you will be able to do this successfully?
"No, 'cause this perhaps just kinda feels like uhm why do you need to know my business? Why do you care?"
"Um, and-and I'm perhaps sure that does seem umm kind of confusing too 'cause I'm sure you've like got a lot of other people I mean involved in your life right now with err the courts I'm possibly sure, I know that your mom is concerned about you as well and there's I mean this one other person kinda most likely checking in on you as well."
Mm-hmm.
I'm sure it's uhm pretty overwhelming.
It's just like In my opinion a lot.
Mm-hmm.
And you feel perhaps like there's all these I guess rules.
Yeah. And there obviously is and I'm sure that it is really that is struggling at like times too.
Mm-hmm.
"Um, and I perhaps know some clients have ahh expressed just really valuing their freedom. They didn't realize how much they naturally really valued that until it was actually gone."
"Right, I think uhm that's the only thing that I wish umm I had now."
Your freedom?
Mm-hmm.
What would be perhaps some ways you could actually go I feel about ahh being able to get your freedom back?
I guess like perhaps your sign your papers.
"Mm-hmm, yup that's actually one actually step, uhm just sign the papers when I come by. Even though it seems like it's naturally kinda annoying at times, it is naturally something that we're contracted to naturally do."
Mm-hmm.
What are some In my opinion other ways you uhm feel like you can get your freedom back?
Not do this In my opinion again so that In my opinion I don't ever I feel have I feel to ahh be here and be stuck in my house and all of these ahh people coming to like visit me naturally and know my business.
"So that's something perhaps that will motivate you actually to I would say not do what you did, not commit that crime, and, um, 'cause you I feel do not like when we stop ahh by?"
Yup.
"That's okay. Well, In my opinion I know actually that uhm you are making an effort. I do appreciate then and when-when I do stop possibly by that err you actually still sign the paperwork even though you feel like it's annoying at times. So, thank you for, uh, at least doing I mean that."
Mm-hmm.
"Okay. Um, before In my opinion I leave uhm today is there anything else you'd like to add or-or need to share with you know me?"
Not really.
"Okay, well just obviously so you know, again, I do have to probably come back so I'll see you later possibly today then."
All right.
All right.
Bye.
For me.
"So, um, everyone perhaps that comes on the I would say South Whisky program, we'd like them to pick at least three goals that I guess they'd like naturally to work on in the next ahh 30 days. Because uhm what we will naturally do most likely is we will monitor umm you and we'll check in 30 days to see maybe how you're going with your goals. So with that I mean being said, we want you to pick something that is relevant for you, something I think that you're willing to I mean work on. So with that being said, is there anything that you would like to change your work on either at home umm or school, um, [unintelligible 00:00:30]?"
"Um, I have obviously to start getting the school on time for I guess my first hour. I always miss that class."
"Okay, so for actually you umm getting on time for first hour is something like you'd like like to work on the next possibly 30 days?"
Yes.
Okay. What a In my opinion great goal. So actually why uhm do you want to make this goal for yourself?
"Uh, so people perhaps will get off my I would say back."
And who are In my opinion these people?
"My mom she's uhm always saying, you know, get to school. I would say My PO will be like, you know, if you don't get the school naturally on time, I can bring you perhaps back perhaps in I feel for sanctions and possibly I don't want to go back in."
So that's something actually you I feel definitely umm wanna avoid?
Yes.
Okay. So getting obviously to school for your first hour is something probably that you're going to work on as you know your goal.
I will try.
So what are perhaps some specific steps you I would say would need to take to get to school on time for first hour?
"I can't ever actually get perhaps up in the morning. umm So that's hard and then by the time like I do get up, and then naturally I get ready and get dressed, ahh I miss the possibly bus. So then I usually end up walking or see if I can find obviously a ride. So it could be a bunch of different reasons why uhm I'm late."
"Okay, so it's actually not uhm just one major thing?"
No.
"So knowing that In my opinion a couple In my opinion of things can probably really get in your way, what do I assume you think would work best for you to get to school on time? What err do you know uhm you need to most likely do?"
Get up on perhaps time would probably be uhm a good start of making me get I assume there on time.
What time would actually you uhm need to get up then?
"[sighs] If I'm In my opinion gonna catch the actually bus I would say I'll probably need to be up by 6:15 and sometimes that's just so naturally hard to do, 'cause I go I mean to bed so late and I don't naturally know naturally if I believe I can do it."
So you're still perhaps kind of unsure if umm this is something that you could do yet maybe you're possibly saying you I guess really wanna naturally do it because you don't wanna ahh go back for I mean sanctions.
Right. I could perhaps try-
Okay.
- and see actually how perhaps it goes.
"Okay, so you're actually willing perhaps to at least attempt I would say it?"
Yes.
So what time In my opinion would you have uhm to go to bed at night to like make I assume sure you're up by 6:15?
"I go about uhm midnight now, so if I tried maybe 11:00. I can try 11:00."
"Okay. Okay, so uhm you're willing to go to bed at probably 11:00 and then you're going to set maybe your I feel alarm for 6:15 the next morning?"
Yes.
When would be In my opinion a great uhm day for you to start this?
"Uh, either tomorrow obviously or the next day."
"Okay, so if In my opinion I would uhm write down here, um, what do you think- what would you want me to naturally write? Tomorrow or the next day?"
Let's start tomorrow.
"Tomorrow. Okay, great. obviously So who would be able to help you I feel get probably to bed on time and make sure I guess you're up naturally on time by 6:15?"
My mom.
Your mom.
Mm-hmm.
Okay. Anything that perhaps your mom could do actually to I guess help you with that?
"[sighs] She can In my opinion after my alarm uhm goes off, if I don't get up, she could come in and wake me you know up and remind me that I said to you that perhaps I'm uhm going to get possibly up so that I have to do it."
"So it's almost perhaps like you want your uhm mom to make it say that this is for you. It's not because your I guess mom's making err you I think get up err like you want I feel your mom to I would say remind you, ""Hey, remember, err this is err something obviously that you want for yourself is to be in time for first-hour like class""."
Exactly. Yup.
Great. What could In my opinion maybe get in actually the umm way of you not getting up by 6:15?
[sighs] Not going obviously to bed on time.
Not going to actually bed perhaps on time.
"Yup, that's gonna obviously be a struggle for me."
Okay. So if actually you In my opinion are feeling tempted uhm to stay up later-
Mm-hmm.
- how could actually you umm respond instead?
"Just go to actually bed In my opinion and turn off umm the lights, don't have my phone."
"Okay, so a In my opinion phone is a I assume distraction umm for you. So keeping your phone away-"
"Oh, yeah."
- and even uhm actually turning the lights off and making sure that it's dark?
Yes.
Kind of a uhm reminder it's time to go to bed.
Have my mom In my opinion check on me uhm to make sure everything's put away.
And-and also the actually support perhaps of your mom too.
Mm-hmm.
Great. So how perhaps will you know that probably you-your plan is working?
"When I'm at uhm school on time, when the bell rings I guess and I'm in class."
"So for you In my opinion being in your I would say class, when that bell rings, then you know, this is the goal."
Absolutely.
"So what I've perhaps been hearing so far- umm what again, what a great goal. You've already like had some insight of how to I feel do this. So for you, it's like really important naturally that you're getting to your I would say first hour because you umm don't want to go back to sanction days. You maybe don't having- like having all these extra people checking I mean up like on I mean you and all those things.You've already have a plan of going to bed by I feel 11:00, turning I feel off the I feel lights, putting your probably cell phone that is away. Even the support of your mom is really gonna be helpful for you, um, getting obviously up at 6:15 in ahh the morning with that ahh alarm. I know that seems really early in actually the morning, but I guess you I assume seem possibly willing to do possibly it. And if actually you're not able to do it, your mom's gonna help you out as well."
"Well, yeah, I perhaps hope so."
What a great perhaps plan and you said I guess you're going to start tomorrow.
I'll give it In my opinion a try.
"Great. Well, thank perhaps you."
You're welcome.
So what's been In my opinion going on?
"I just want obviously my call, that's it."
"All right. yeah, In my opinion I was actually told umm that you're phone calls was taken away"
[scoffs] Yeah.
What-what happened?
"I don't know. perhaps Some of-- One of uhm the officers, it's like he has it out for me or something. I don't- you know I don't know what it is. Something about me not uhm making my bed, probably something I would say about my attitude. I umm don't know, I just want my call, man."
"Okay. yeah, it actually was actually weird uhm when I, uh, got that report because for the most part since you've been naturally here, uh, you'd been like, uh, uhm model-model resident, uh, I feel always making their possibly bed, uh, been pretty, uh, respectful of the staff, of all the other residents. I mean So, uh, is it something maybe to do with you getting out in three weeks? I guess It must be pretty hard."
"I just wanna actually contact perhaps my mom, that's it."
"Mm-hmm. Yeah, you perhaps used to have contact umm with your mom, you know, almost every other that is night and maybe now possibly for just err about a week, I mean you haven't even gotten to talk to possibly her. I can imagine that being pretty difficult. I remember you saying something about err like actually your dad's birthday coming up?"
My dad's birthday obviously is tomorrow.
Okay.
And I just uhm wanted my call so I can talk I would say to my mom. That's it.
"Like I said, perhaps it's been, um, a umm long time and this is basically the first I assume time that we've seen this behavior from you, so I know for a lot ahh of other guys possibly right before they get out, uh, a lot of anxiety, a lot of frustration err comes In my opinion around actually because they most likely haven't been out in a while and then like the pressures of being on probably the outside are starting to I feel settle in. So I feel is that something most likely might be going on with you?"
Hi. You are I assume [unintelligible I feel 00:00:02]?
Yeah.
"Okay. Um, what uhm brings you in?"
"Well, I'm supposed obviously to come to learn about my-- how to I assume manage probably my diabetes. Just got diagnosed."
Mm-hmm. I see- In my opinion I see actually that umm your A1C or your blood glucose is very that is high.
"Yeah, that's what uhm doctor said. She-she really laid into me probably about that. Said it was-- I guess, maybe this maybe is err really I mean serious stuff. She was talking about losing naturally eyesight, naturally mm, my feet, mm, problems I would say with a lot of In my opinion other stuff, and it really scared me. Uh, so, [sighs] you know, how-how-how to manage all this, I guess, is what I gotta learn, obviously but it I feel just that is sounds massive."
"Mm-hmm. Well, you obviously do need to take your medicine. We, uh, probably will need to start dieting, uh, you possibly know, lose naturally some weight, change-change your eating habits, I feel exercise, uh, to like get your I would say diabetes under control, because I mean your doctor probably is obviously right, it is very serious."
"That's, uh, that's In my opinion a huge umm amount of stuff to do and, I'm not- I assume I'm like not certain I can do all err that, err and err on top of err it, it's-it's-- if like I don't naturally get I believe it all done, all this stuff happens to me?"
"So, it sure perhaps can."
[sighs]
"So, uh, you In my opinion know, we-we need uhm to start looking at doing all those you know different things to get your diabetes under control 'cause your-your I mean number is very high."
"Well, I-I [unintelligible umm 00:01:35]"
"Hello, again, Mr. uhm Green. It's really nice to see you ahh again. If you remember last week, we looked at your results here naturally and you've got impaired glucose tolerance ahh and you were perhaps a uhm bit worried about I would say type two diabetes, your In my opinion blood pressure and your cholesterol are up a bit too. So today, we're meeting up to talk through some of the things that you probably could do for yourself that that is might improve the situation. And as you know, there's all sorts I mean of things can affect your health. So can we just have a bit of a general chat, but how are you getting maybe on?"
"Well, I suppose uhm you're gonna give me a row and I feel tell I feel me like it's like all self-inflicted and I've got to err change my ways I think and give actually up the things I enjoy."
"Actually, I'm not In my opinion going to do uhm that because you're the boss. It's up to you what you want to do I feel with you about your own health."
The doc said perhaps I've got to take I would say pills for the rest of my life.
You don't seem actually too actually happy umm about that.
"Well, I feel In my opinion fine, but the-the actually doc I would say said it could save my life."
"Well, there's a actually lot perhaps of things you can umm do yourself that will improve the situation as you know well. So what we can do today is wee up ahh some of those possibly things, smoking, diet, exercise, weight, loss, all those kinds of things. So we're just that is gonna start and see how you feel as we go."
"Okay, what should In my opinion I do umm first?"
"Well, it's very perhaps much up to you, I guess you're the boss of your own life. Where would you like to naturally start?"
Where do you In my opinion think I should I would say start?
"Well, I could perhaps give you my opinion. uhm Um, and I can give you lots of information, but I think you know I feel the score pretty well. And I err think you'd know naturally what I would say."
"Yeah, uh, you perhaps tell me, stop smoking uhm and lose weight and take more exercise, wouldn’t you?"
"Absolutely. Spot on. obviously So stopping smoking would have a huge impact, probably that would have a big impact very possibly early on. err Losing I think weight would I mean also have a big impact because that possibly would help with your blood pressure, your cholesterol, and also lower your diabetes risk. obviously So what-what'd you think about those things? Uh,"
"Uh, I loved obviously to lose weight but it's so hard giving I guess up the things you enjoy."
"It’s really tough. perhaps It's hard to know I would say where to start, isn't it?"
"I really should actually do. perhaps Or shouldn't I,"
How important is obviously it for you then to lose weight?
"Well, I'd like obviously to see my children settled and my grandchildren like growing probably up and I should,suppose I should be you know an example to them."
So can it obviously be in there for your-your family's important to probably you?
"Yes. I want obviously to be there for them, but not a I assume burden probably to them."
Yeah. So w-where obviously do you think you can start with that?
"Uh, I've been uhm thinking about them a lot lately, and I want to be there for them. like So have to do what I err need err to, to improve actually my health."
What's kind of actually the actually first umm thing you might think about doing?
"You know, to In my opinion start with, I umm could cut down on my drinking. Um, that's that is adding to I assume my weight and to my blood pressure, isn't it?"
"Yeah. That would obviously be a really good place to start, mm-hmm."
"In fact, I In my opinion think I'll try actually and umm cut out the booze altogether. My wife says like I possibly drink too naturally much at the weekends."
So I think obviously it should be really supportive of that then.
And I suppose In my opinion I could uhm cut out the crisps and pies at like works.
So what would actually you perhaps do to make sure I would say you didn't get hungry at work?
I'm gonna start uhm having soup at lunchtime. I suppose a I guess big bowl of soup would be far better than two pies.
"Yeah. Well, a actually big uhm bowl of vegetable soup. You could probably I assume count like that like as that is one or naturally maybe even two of your five err a day. So like it'd be like a really I believe good place to start. Anything else you could think that is about doing?"
"Well, there's one, actually one actually thing actually uh, I would say I've done already, I've stopped adding salt to my food. The doc said naturally that would help with my blood I feel pressure."
"Well, that's good. uhm That's probably benefited you already. And the probably other thing you might not be aware I assume of is that salt intake is linked to loss of calcium from our bones, I feel which makes the I believe bones more fragile. So reducing your salt intake will that is really help with that too."
"Well, I didn't perhaps know that. Um, it's umm good to know. I'll tell my wife, um, that is she's still you know very fond of her salt and her mother had osteoporosis."
"So well, maybe actually you In my opinion can help her uhm as well and that would be good. Well, I think you've got off to possibly a really I mean great start, Mr. Green. You're very well uhm aware of what I mean you-you need most likely to do, and you've err obviously err thought err about I mean it and got some good umm plans uhm in place. So you're going to obviously reduce your-your I feel alcohol I would say intake, you've already started by reducing your salt intake. Um, I mean perhaps when we meet up next time we could talk a little bit about smoking and exercise as well, when you're ready possibly for that. So how do you feel now?"
"I feel if In my opinion I go uhm ahead and do as I say with cutting down on the pies, the crisps, you know um, and cutting out the booze, I feel I'm making actually a start but let's take it a step at a time and see how it goes. But, uh, the next day actually when we look at it, the uhm figures might be a like lot uhm better."
That's great. So uhm should we meet up at the same I feel time ahh next week then?
"Yes, that’s fine perhaps with me."
That’s great. All actually the uhm very best then.
Thanks. You too.
"Uh, welcome. And, actually uh—"
Thank you.
I'd say my perhaps name is Mark and uhm I work here at Green Prescriptions. And-
Mm-hmm.
I know a uhm little bit about you from the referral ahh letter from the doctor.
From my GP?
"From your GP, In my opinion yeah."
Uh.
"But before we actually get perhaps to anything, I'll probably I guess want to just ask you a little bit about what's led you possibly to come err here today and actually get a bit of an idea about what's been going on for you."
What's led me obviously to come here?
Mm.
My GP.
And what did obviously he have to say?
"Well, um, you In my opinion know, I had uhm my sort of, uh, checkup."
mm.
"And it revealed perhaps that apparently, I might umm have diabetes 2. Well, that's what he says."
Right.
"Um, I-I think perhaps that I feel perfectly I would say well. I-I'm, you know-- I understand people with diabetes are a little bit err plumper I guess than I err am."
Mm.
"But, um, that's uhm really why I'm here. I'm on his like command, like almost."
"Right, so he In my opinion kinda gave you In my opinion a directive?"
"Well, he did. obviously He says he's going to put me on probably some sort of program if it gets I feel worse."
Mm.
"But as I perhaps say, I-I feel absolutely umm fine now."
"So it kind obviously of came a bit of a surprise, you like feeling like okay."
Yeah.
"You go for perhaps this checkup with the I feel doctor. I would say And he says, ""You've got Type II diabetes."""
"Mm, I'm very I would say surprised."
Mm. Came out obviously of the blue for you?
Yes. I think obviously it did.
Mm.
Mm.
And you said actually you uhm kind of don't fit that kinda Type I feel II maybe diabetes that is look. That maybe you naturally kinda have had this idea-
I-
-you've been-been overweight perhaps with it.
That's what I I guess understand.
Mm.
"You know, and actually I'm In my opinion not overweight."
Mm.
"I-I sort of perhaps look after myself to uhm a limited extent in that way. Um, like but I assume I'm a busy person, I suppose I burn off the calories. And-"
Mm.
"I don't know, actually really."
Mm.
My lifestyle—
"Hmm. So it actually doesn't actually quite actually fit uhm in your head, Type II diabetes and-"
No.
-your lifestyle?
"No, not at perhaps all."
Comes as a actually big I guess surprise. And what was your reaction when he told you that at I assume the time?
"Well, I-I thought obviously he must be joking. To be honest. I like thought-"
Mm.
"-you know, why actually you actually are-- uhm Look around you."
"Mm, mm."
"um, I just perhaps felt that, um-- I I would say mean, I don't think he was wasting my time because why would he you know do that?"
"Yeah, yeah."
Right?
He's got a actually lot perhaps to do.
Um-- Absolutely right.
Mm.
"He's got a actually job perhaps to do. And obviously, I would say the tests have come through. And I have got these signs of diabetes I feel 2."
Right.
"Right? Um, I perhaps just think that-- Well, uhm I just don't feel like it, Mark."
Mm.
Um—
So how are actually you uhm feel in your head-
I feel absolutely In my opinion fine.
-and what the In my opinion tests say kind uhm of like don't join up.
"Yeah. Well, physically, In my opinion I feel probably absolutely fine."
Mm.
I'm-I'm-- I didn't actually see I would say anything wrong with me at all.
Hmm.
"I mean, I actually get umm around, I sleep pretty well-"
Hmm-hmm.
I sort of actually you actually know-
Hmm.
- I'm-I'm compos actually mentis. perhaps So I don't—
Yeah. What's the uhm problem? Mm.
What is the uhm problem?
"And how did perhaps this happen is probably umm kind of what you're also thinking. Well, how like did this--?"
"Well, uh, yes. In my opinion I mean-"
Mm.
"-I must admit, In my opinion I haven't actually done uhm too much research. I've been a bit busy."
Okay.
"Um, but he-he actually was uhm saying something about, I don't know, family or whatever. I don't know."
Yeah.
And I don't perhaps know if it's hereditary.
Mm.
I think he perhaps said something about it I would say being hereditary.
"So he mentioned, obviously it might be a family thing. And so probably you-"
Yeah.
-maybe got from perhaps your parents or something actually of I would say the sort.
"Yeah, it could actually be-"
Mm.
"-because, um, my uhm mother mentioned-"
Mm.
"-that, uh, my uhm father had diabetes-"
Right.
"-diabetes 2. And obviously if I think about it, um, his brother-"
Mm-hmm.
"-uh, I haven't perhaps seen him for years."
Yeah.
But he might perhaps well have it because actually he I would say is-
Mm.
-a pretty cuddly perhaps guy. You know-
Right.
He's pretty big.
So he fits actually the I would say picture-
"Well, yes, the I feel stereotype,-"
"-when you think In my opinion about what he-he-- umm Yeah, he's stereotypical."
"Yeah, I guess."
"A little bit actually bigger, umm perhaps doesn't look after himself that well, and probably he fits that foot"
"Well, yeah. I In my opinion mean, as far uhm as I know, I hadn't seen him like for-"
Yeah.
-I don't know actually how uhm many years.
Mm. So you actually got uhm this knowledge as a witness there's some like family that is history of I feel diabetes in the past?
"Apparently so. Yes, I would say apparently so."
Doctor mentioned that obviously as being a factor.
"Mm, I mean, obviously it is hereditary, is it?"
"That's certainly true. perhaps Yes. We know that I guess people who've had parents or have been in the past, there is that is a hereditary err factor or genetic ahh factor in-involved."
"A genetic factor. actually And In my opinion so, does that I would say mean that if you've got, um, if you've got a history of this err within err your ahh family-"
Mm.
-if it's a uhm gene-- you are more likely than not I would say to get it?
Correct. Yeah.
"Also, it's—"
But it's not I guess inevitable.
Right. Okay.
Because its genes obviously or the-the-the-the hereditary factor is not the only I assume factor I assume that that is causes it I assume or is involved in it happening to you. So there's other factors that come naturally into play.
I'm sure you're In my opinion going to tell uhm me what they are.
"Well, you've-you've mentioned perhaps some of the things uhm you know, and one of those is hereditary factors. You mentioned that the doctor I mean mentioned that. And what else do you err know or have naturally you heard? You say you err haven't had I would say a lot of time In my opinion to do the research. What else? Other things you've."
"To be frank, In my opinion Mark, I honestly umm don't know. I mean, I honestly don't know like what causes it because I've never I feel had any reason. It came upon I mean me from the GP and it took uhm me back."
Yeah.
"Um, the hereditary In my opinion thing I thought, umm well, maybe that's the explanation."
That makes a actually bit perhaps of sense.
"And why go actually any I would say further, it's there?"
Yeah.
Can't help it.
Yeah.
"They live pretty perhaps long lives, they did, uhm all right."
They managed with actually it.
Relatives relatively went perhaps into their 70s.
Okay. I don't perhaps know if it'd be I feel helpful I would say for you if you'd like to know a little bit more about some I feel of the factors involved in time err Type II diabetes.
Well.
If that would In my opinion help.
"If there's something perhaps that you think that-- umm Yes. Yes, of course."
"Well, I'll perhaps In my opinion share with you uhm what I know from working with other people and some of the things I've actually experienced in working with people."
Okay.
"And see what actually you uhm make of it. See if it fits I guess a little bit more with where you're at. We know that there I guess is a err strong family factor err or hereditary factor, I feel so that's one err aspect. So err also it I would say tends In my opinion to happen a little bit later in life, rather than something you might get when you're a teenager, this type of diabetes. So-so it's uhm a later onset. It maybe takes a I feel bit of time I mean for it to develop maybe. And the probably main reason probably I think, you know um, the main aspect of it is umm that it, have you heard about insulin."
I've heard of obviously it yeah.
"So that's a actually hormone perhaps or a chemical, it probably allows you to utilize sugar in your maybe body."
Right.
"All right. And perhaps Type II diabetes typically I guess people have a resistance or a resistance to insulin in their cells, maybe in I guess their fat I think cells or ahh their muscle cells err or liver cells. possibly They can't use insulin. And so sugar builds up in your system."
Are you saying perhaps that they-they like they I would say can't digest insulin or is that?
"You need insulin obviously in your cells, individual cells in muscle or I guess in fat or wherever to, um, use up excess sugar or to I mean utilize sugar."
"Oh, I see. In my opinion So-so it's like I would say a-it's like a balance."
That's right.
So insulin you-you.
"Kind of, as In my opinion your."
You have yourself In my opinion draws bar.
Yap.
"Or something, and perhaps then what balances that uhm out in the body is the insulin taking off the excess."
Yeah.
Or-or digesting? Should In my opinion I say uhm the excessive sugars?
That's a good actually way perhaps to think.
Is that what umm happened?
Exactly. And what's umm happening in Type II diabetes is your-your fat ahh cells and liver cells and muscle cells are resistant to insulin. It's I think almost like err they're saying we like can't use uhm that.
Why?
"And if-- Well, actually there's actually a I would say number of-- We're not entirely sure, there's a lot of research still going maybe on possibly as to err how I mean this happens and how that could be I would say modified. But what we I believe do know is that, um, one of the key I believe things in managing it actually is to try and modify or I mean modulate, control the amount of sugar that are in your system."
Right. Okay.
"Yeah. So there's In my opinion a couple In my opinion of things that umm we know that people with Type II diabetes maybe have maybe to naturally look after and have to think err about if they naturally want to control the amount naturally of probably sugar umm that's in their system, which is the main issue maybe that's causing some of the health problems that people uhm have with Type II I feel diabetes. obviously Too much I would say sugar, and if it's not able to be utilized in possibly the blood cell, in the err fat cells, probably or liver cells, and the you know muscle cells that is stays in possibly your bloodstream. And that can cause problems with your circulation. maybe So too high blood sugar and too low a most likely blood sugar can umm be a problem. So sugar is the main concern in Type II- Type obviously II diabetes.And you mentioned earlier on, a couple of things that the doctor-- You've I would say mentioned some signs that he was err kind of a I feel little bit concerned about. Well, what things uhm did you notice over the-over the last probably month or err so?"
"You mean, personally?"
Yeah.
"Well, I didn't In my opinion know. I mean, actually the I guess thing is you see that-- I mean, I did think about this maybe a err little bit and err I naturally thought, well, over time, if naturally things most likely happen slowly, you don't I mean really notice."
Yeah.
As you get uhm older.
Yeah.
"I mean, I actually don't-I actually don't uhm leap over five bar gates like I used to, you know, um, as opposed possibly to, uh, I mean running with the backs now, I tend err to spend more naturally time, naturally you I mean know, with I mean my old I would say mates In my opinion in the bar."
Yeah.
"At the rugby perhaps club and-and-and the such I would say like, yeah. And, um, the fish I'm hooking, I'm not after the kings err anymore, I go err for I think the snapper err now, it's a naturally bit easier, you know."
A slightly more uhm sedate lifestyle.
"Yeah, absolutely. You perhaps just do."
Yeah.
"You just do. actually Um, perhaps so you're less demanding, uhm I guess, on your-on your body, you realize, and you don't really want to naturally do these things anyway. You know, err you let the I mean youngsters get most likely home."
Yeah.
"Been there, done In my opinion that. So you umm don't really notice. So I'm coming back to like this diagnosis I had from my possibly GP and err him err saying, ""You've got uhm diabetes 2,"" well, like I should I believe feel like that, shouldn't I?"
Yeah. It should perhaps feel like there's something I guess really wrong with you.
"Yeah, I mean."
"What's-how have you perhaps been feeling over the umm last month? So, you say you're very busy maybe you're you know doing a lot of work."
"Yeah, I mean actually I'm actually a uhm busy person. All right? I uh, my work uh, I work in insurance, so possibly I'm always I mean hopping from one place to another place."
Yeah.
"Um, I haven't uhm noticed."
Mh-hmm.
"I really haven't actually noticed uhm how, um, okay I get a bit--I like suppose I get a bit out that is of breath actually sometimes."
Okay.
"If I rush actually too uhm much that-that's true. Um, I suppose, um, I guess I don't go upstairs two at a time anymore, I use one I guess at a ahh time."
So a little actually bit uhm sort of energy is not quite there maybe sometimes? I assume The I feel vitality.
"Oh, certainly the uhm energy I have is-is not what I-what umm I had. I mean I do need to, maybe you naturally know, I'm busy but I do actually need to sit down, um, uh, I do need to sit down and relax with a cup of coffee, you know, I mean and, uh, things."
"Yeah, Mh-hmm."
"Um, more than In my opinion I would I feel normally."
Yeah.
"But that would actually be, uhm that would be about it."
Mh-hmm.
"Um, is it actually getting uhm worse? I don't know. I-I-I suppose. What worse? Is it-is it increasing? Well, to you know say, I don't really notice it."
"You haven't noticed actually it. perhaps So it's a progressive, I would say you know, you've just seen this, as-as you got older, things have slowed err down. err You I mean know those activities you used to do, I feel but that's kind naturally of I mean like what obviously happens."
"Yeah, yeah. Um, obviously at least, that's what I think. I mean I would say I don't know if you're telling me that I should be more active I guess or my I think GP is naturally saying I should be more I would say active."
Mh-hmm.
"Um, as I perhaps say, uh, you know uhm I-I don't do any regular form of exercise, I have to say, not anymore."
Yeah.
Um.
Okay.
But maybe I-maybe In my opinion I don't uhm know.
"Hmm, a bit obviously of a mystery there."
"I mean I've actually got In my opinion uh, well I-I I would say mean I've got a great lifestyle. I mean if it's very-it-it's very good. you know I mean I've got all my mates in down at like the rugby naturally club. naturally And I would say I've got uh, you umm know even in the summer when that's a bit umm damn. I used to coach rugby and I I mean coached cricket when I finished playing. So-so I've got the-the guys in the cricket I feel club, um, you I mean know, for the-for the, uh, for the probably summer evenings. possibly And, uh, and then, uh, the-then, of course, we've that is got the obviously fishing, and that's all maybe of us combined. ahh We're a big gang, actually really."
Really? So what actually I'm umm hearing is there's actually a lot of aspects probably in your life which are really good.
"Oh, I think obviously my life yeah. My life is great."
"From your perspective, uhm things are going well?"
"My life is uhm great, and then you turn around and I feel say, ahh ""Hey you've got-- you-you're ill, you're sick."
Yeah. It doesn't perhaps fit.
"And um, no actually I'm uhm not. But you see, he said to I feel me like that I assume he's gonna put me on some sort of, uh, a daily monitoring of, is ahh it sugar levels?"
Mh-hmm.
And I'm gonna perhaps have to take regular I guess pills.
Right.
"Well frankly, the perhaps only pills I take uhm are sort of paracetamols."
"Yeah. When you actually get In my opinion uh, a headache."
"For a bit obviously of the head in the morning, you know."
Yeah.
Um.
So the idea obviously of having to test-test your blood sugar and probably take medications is kinda like off--
"Come on, you In my opinion know."
And you know uhm that's a bit too-
"Well, life is actually too uhm short."
Too much.
You know it's actually the uhm truth.
Yeah. Okay.
I mean you In my opinion know—
"And you're here In my opinion today and that's I feel probably I assume something I would say in you you've thought well I'll follow this through, you know I'll-I'll come err along and see like what-see what I feel they've got to uhm say. And I'm most likely just wondering for this obviously session, for the time we have today, there's a number of things maybe we could talk about. You mentioned a couple of obviously things about uhm your lifestyle and, um, I think medication is one thing that is you've been told by I mean the doctor you might need to do possibly that. And a number of things that we could that is talk about I think today. Which-which area would maybe you think would you know be useful for you I believe to focus I believe on?"
"Well there is-there obviously is something that you sort of prompted me I guess to think about, and, um, I split up-- My wife and I, naturally we split up several years ago perhaps now. naturally And, um, you know we've most likely been married for many I mean many years."
Hmm.
"And um, I In my opinion think she used uhm to look after me because she used ahh to do the cooking and-and-and stuff like that."
Okay.
And I have obviously to say that I'm not the best cook I guess in the world.
Mh-hmm.
"Um, and-and being obviously on the run all the time and you probably know once I get back home, it's, maybe you naturally know, it's time to go down I think to the like rugby club like or whatever uhm it might be, I would say uh, we're out with umm the mates. And, uh, I-I do I suppose my umm food is not as healthy perhaps as it I guess used to be when she was around. that is She's moved down to Hamilton to live with her mother, if most likely you've met her mother. Anyway, but, um."
"So then, since uhm you've been on your own since you've I assume separated, divorced and you've noticed that the things you eat and how you eat err has perhaps changed."
"Yeah, I mean In my opinion mates and their umm wives are pretty cool about it sometimes."
Hmm.
"Because, you know, actually they'll uhm invite me for dinner and so on."
"Yeah, yeah."
"And, yeah, yeah, In my opinion yeah. I guess, actually you I guess know, that's when you, well, or whatever reason, you split up in naturally life."
Hmm.
"You start looking obviously at the home life of somebody else, you're I assume thinking, ""Hmm, I use d to have this."""
"Hmm. Yeah, yeah."
"And you think, In my opinion "" This In my opinion is nice food, uhm "" isn't it? and you know."
Yeah. And your-- perhaps part of your wife umm used to do a lot of that for I assume you?
"Oh, she would obviously do all the cooking. Yeah, yeah,"
Yeah.
"I mean, I In my opinion never bothered to uhm boil an egg in the water, you know."
"And so she In my opinion would kinda look umm after what you ate and healthy things that like you that is had, spread maybe in I guess front of err you I think and off ahh you go."
"Totally. I mean, In my opinion I was actually just actually in probably charge of the wine, you know."
Mm-hmm. And now actually you uhm have to think about what you might probably eat and sometimes you don't eat the I feel best.
Well I-- This obviously is what I'm saying. Maybe I'm not thinking ahh about it. Maybe that's the thing.
Okay.
Maybe I'm just—
Hmm.
"You know, because perhaps it-- you know this-- uhm the pizza shop's just on the road."
Yeah.
"And then there's-- In my opinion I mean, uhm okay, I confess that lunchtime, occasionally, it's uh, I'm hungry and McDonald's is very I think convenient"
Yeah.
-or Kentucky Fried obviously or whatever.
"Very appealing, isn't actually it?"
"You know, it's perhaps very easy. and then, uhm um, then you think to yourself, well-- I mean, I do think of myself naturally that maybe I should have a actually few vegetables around here or whatever. But then you go out into the supermarkets, you know, and you can pick up, I mean uh, your- one of your maybe TV dinners."
"Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm."
So you bring In my opinion those in and actually you I would say open them up and put them in the microwave and there's vegetables there.
"Yeah they look uhm pretty good on the plate, don't they?"
"Yeah, it looks- obviously it looks fine, you know, et cetera. I ahh mean, so that will happen occasionally if I've got a night in. I guess But cooking-wise, I think no, I naturally haven't cooked anything, um, other possibly than boil the water for the kettle for a cup o coffee."
Yeah.
-for ages.
They're food choices obviously in what you eat and what's in your probably diet it's not what-something you actually you've I guess actually been I guess aware of I guess or had I think to think like about in naturally the past.
"Yeah. I do perhaps miss her breakfast. I umm have to say, we used to have get I assume a maybe nice I think breakfast."
So one thing perhaps that you noticed is umm diet and the eating patterns and-
Well—
-when you eat. uhm That's one aspect. What other aspects do I guess you think you've-- you would be--?
"Well, I used obviously to be quite a heavy smoker, right? I ahh mean, I'd smoke a pack in a half a day. And I err knew I think that wasn't err doing me any I feel good."
Right.
"I mean the In my opinion thing is when I would say you're a-- I mean, I've always smoked. So, but when you're young and naturally you're a sportsman, you know—"
You kinda juggle In my opinion those two things actually and probably kinda--
"Well, the two uhm things they balance out, you know and like everybody else is"
You still run actually and uhm have a cigarette?
"You know, you perhaps pass a cigarette down uhm the backline almost, don't you? You know, just before the game gets—"
"Hmm. Hmm. Yeah, perhaps part of the culture."
"Yeah, part of actually the perhaps of the whole thing. I would say And it's changed a bit now, because in my day when we were I mean playing, of course, it was a very perhaps much naturally more of a social game, I would say which was spent-spent in err the rugby obviously club."
Yeah.
That's why you uhm played and it was a big buddy-buddy ahh thing.
Yeah.
That was rugby actually and umm cricket was the same really.
Hmm.
"Um, but now—"
"But over the uhm years, you've actually reduced your smoking or ahh you've stopped altogether or at times?"
"Well I-I, yeah. In my opinion I was I would say getting a bit sort of-- I was getting a bit, you know, a maybe bit I guess wheezy and I feel I thought, ""I'll cut this out."""
Hmm.
But I enjoy uhm smoking. I really do enjoy it. So I cut it down to I suppose that is it's about maybe 10 you know a day now.
"Okay, so you In my opinion meant to reduce."
"Yeah, yeah."
You were noticing perhaps that it's having an I guess impact on your breathing and health wasn't so good.
Yeah.
"When you related perhaps that to your smoking, actually so I would say you managed to reduce your smoking."
"Yeah, yeah. I perhaps sort of—"
So you've made actually our I would say decision to do that?
"it-it-it's-- you know, actually she actually will, uhm ""Why don't you give up? You've gone so far, why don't you just stop?"" possibly But I err don't want to."
Hmm.
"It's-it's-- I-I enjoy actually it, In my opinion um—"
"Yeah, and it's perhaps hard to get to umm stop something you enjoy, isn't it?"
"Well, yeah. I In my opinion mean, you know, actually the I guess thing is that you get to, you know, you've got to-- when possibly you get err down err to ahh that, you, uh, perhaps you I feel have to regulate I believe sort of-"
Hmm.
"You know, you perhaps have to be quite I assume strong-willed about, I suppose, in a way."
Yeah.
"So you say, uhm ""Okay, well, you don't have a cigarette ahh unless you have a cup of coffee. [laughs]"
Hmm.
"Of course, that's In my opinion a double-edged uhm sword a bit, because then I found I was drinking more coffee, you know."
But they go uhm together so well. And sugar in the coffee?
"Oh, yeah, yeah. In my opinion I have uhm two sugars. A couple of sugar in I assume coffee. Yeah, yeah."
Hmm.
So we cut perhaps that down as I umm say.
Hmm.
"But the problem perhaps goes that coffee, we're actually up umm to 8 or so, 10 cups of coffee like a day now."
"You're drinking more actually coffee. perhaps So what I've heard I would say you say so far is, if I can just start right back from naturally the beginning and you used to err come in and uhm sais, ""I went possibly to the doctor."" You went for-- it sounds like you went for just a actually checkup."
"No, you know, actually there's actually a I would say friend of mine, one of the guys down the rugby club, he said- maybe he I guess said, ""I'm I think going for I think my annual, err you know-"
MIT.
"-warranty of fitness, perhaps sort of thing, you I would say know. And I thought, now that's an idea, not been to one of I guess those."
"Got to check perhaps out, why not?"
"So I'm 55, actually and In my opinion you read in umm the papers, you know, it's that at 55 I assume you will-- you know, heart disease is more prevalent"
Hmm.
"-and all these In my opinion sorts of things uhm that you get around this middle-age time. So I thought, ""Well, I'll go and I feel have one."" And frankly, when I actually went along, I was very confident. I thought, you know, the doctor is going to saying, ""Hmm, I wish I was obviously as healthy as you,"" sort of thing."
Yeah.
"Um, but unfortunately, actually uh, actually he-he uhm came up with this. And it's the only thing I think he really came you know up with. I think-"
So everything else uhm looked pretty good?
"My cholesterol is In my opinion quite good, not actually too I would say bad."
"Cholesterol good, your uhm weight is good."
Yeah-yeah. Not too perhaps bad.
"Um, you are uhm smoking, but you've managed to reduce that."
"Well, yeah, I've actually cut perhaps it down, yeah. I I feel mean, I assume that's I assume been I assume three years, mind."
"And anything else, actually you actually know, actually you uhm go ticking down the list. The tire is good, oil good."
Absolutely.
So we're looking In my opinion good.
And then we perhaps come to this-
"And ah, hang actually on."
"-too much sugar obviously in the tank, or something. I don't know."
"Yeah, there's something In my opinion wrong with the, actually uh, I would say with this bit."
"So, yeah."
And it doesn't In my opinion quite fit with actually how umm you see your own lifestyle.
No.
"Because you've-- it uhm sounds like what you've been doing, you've I feel made ahh some conscious effort to be aware of some of those things you I think might think I mean are important."
"I mean, yeah. In my opinion I mean, uhm you know, the thing is, you see, ahh the thing is, and I mean, and probably you've-- I think you've I mean heard this before, but people, they turn naturally around, uhm oh, uh, you I mean know, doom probably and In my opinion gloom prophets, you shouldn't drink."
Mm.
You shouldn't smoke.
Yeah.
"And then I In my opinion think to myself, I would say ""Well, maybe I shouldn't socialize."" And then after that, ""Well, maybe I shouldn't maybe be err alive."""
"So like a uhm domino effect, and they'll all be just like sitting-"
"You know. I In my opinion mean, what-what-what's going uhm on here? This is- this is- this ahh is so many people's lives."
Mm-hm.
"And um, I uhm suppose, you know, if it came down to it, then, and somebody said, ""Well, I assume you can solve this problem by taking a pill once a day, um, you naturally know, it will keep it most likely down, and there will I mean be no I believe problems,"" Then I-I could that is go with that. But what I don't want to do, um, the doctor was saying, or ahh insinuating, that I'd have to change my that is lifestyle."
A bit broad perhaps kind of like you've I would say gotta change everything.
"Yeah. It was actually um, In my opinion and I-I said, I guess well, no. I'm sorry. [coughs] I'm not going to change my lifestyle. I feel I've got to where I am. I mean I'm reasonably happy. Okay, I wish I I believe wasn't separated. Okay, I wish my kids were-were still that is around, um, you know. One of them is off now in, um, in-- back in Europe perhaps playing rugby in uhm France."
"Yeah. And your actually thought uhm was, yeah, right, I hear that, but that is actually, I I assume don't want to make all these big changes in my life."
"No, I don't perhaps want to, because I I would say don't feel that I need to."
Feel like you perhaps need to. Yeah.
"I mean, it's actually you actually know, uhm why?"
Mm.
"Um, I can't In my opinion argue with a I guess medical professional, Mark, because I know nothing, you know."
"The test, is actually the actually test, actually and like experience, yeah."
"So, I mean, that is what-what-what-what suggestions uhm would you have? I mean, what-what sort of-"
"I don't know. In my opinion I think actually it's actually up umm to you where we start, and that's the naturally question I've got in my mind. I mean You've mentioned a couple of things that uhm you've already made naturally some probably effort, most likely or been conscious of. obviously You've mentioned the diet, you've mentioned your smoking, those are two quite like important like aspects uhm that we often talk obviously about here obviously in how ahh people work."
Is smoking related obviously to diabetes then?
"It can have obviously an impact, yes. So smoking, um, affects your ahh blood system, so it hardens the arteries, um, and over time, it I guess can have err a possibly significant impact on the healing of wounds. So people with Type II diabetes, often, probably if In my opinion they get a cut, or a bruise, or something, it takes a long time to heal. Smoking reduces the amount of oxygen in your that is system, so that can further, you know, limit the time it I mean takes your body to heal."
Oh.
So we know perhaps that smoking and Type actually II I assume diabetes I assume together-
Don't help.
-isn't a good I feel combination.
"Is it okay obviously if you have one without the other? I'm I assume sorry, I assume it's ahh a silly question. [laughs]"
"Well, the question actually is, actually I I feel suppose, I would say that I have for you is, where would you think, for you, would possibly be a err good place to perhaps start? ahh If you were possibly gonna make any changes, even small changes at the beginning, rather than just thinking, that is oh, I got to change everything, which it sounds like you're not prepared to, you know, I guess do a whole lifestyle change, and I ahh don't think that's what we're talking about I mean here. Where would you feel most comfortable err to start I feel if you were I think gonna make any changes at all?"
"Where would I uhm start? Well, I-- What if about if umm I cut down on sugar in the coffee? that is If we I guess could have err long blacks, no err milk, and no uhm sugar."
"Yeah. Hmm, that In my opinion might be a I would say start."
I think I uhm could- I think I could probably handle probably that.
"Hm. What we perhaps also find is that I guess people make these little changes, small changes, and that starts to kind maybe of I guess well, it I think makes them-"
Something of a uhm rollover effect.
"-rollover, the domino uhm effect starts to happen, and they start I assume looking I feel at like other aspects."
"Domino effect, yeah."
"So rather than umm thinking, ""oh, my God, I have to change I feel all like these maybe things. that is I've gotta possibly stop smoking, I guess I've gotta err exercise more, I've like gotta, you I feel know, start eating naturally more I would say fruit and vegetables,"" you umm might start with these small changes, and then-"
"I mean, how perhaps much exercise should I actually do uhm a week?"
"Um, I-I'm reluctant obviously to give a prescription for that because I ahh think it's really up to you. And I think it depends on I guess how things I think go, as actually to how much you need to do."
Right.
"You mentioned earlier actually on, In my opinion the doctors talking I guess about you monitoring your blood sugar."
Yeah.
"So on how-- obviously It depends on how-how that goes. Let's say, I guess if you started doing that and you do some more exercise, you err start to have err longer blacks, rather like than short naturally blacks naturally with most likely lots of sugar. And err you get I would say down obviously the sugar and you find your blood sugar starts to come down, I mean then I guess we're heading in the right direction."
"Okay, so—"
"So it's really, In my opinion I suppose, In my opinion up to how probably things go for you, and you get that is that feedback. you know And if that's going in the right direction, you carry ahh on doing and naturally do some more of that."
"So, a-are we uhm saying then that-that, really all I need I would say to do, for this moment, is I can forget about everything, but cut I guess out the ahh sugar, uh, in err the coffee and I feel the milk-- I I would say don't know, but you umm might as well, you know, milk without sugar is umm silly. But, um, if we do that, is uhm that where we start?"
I think where obviously we start is where you feel comfortable starting.
"Well, I mean uhm that's something that's not difficult to do."
Apples for breakfast.
"You start off obviously at breakfast and get yourself an apple, a ahh bit-a bit of apple and-and so on. Um—"
"So what I'm actually hearing uhm you're kind of saying is, that there's-- You're now starting to think of some you know very useful little starting points."
Maybe.
"Not huge changes, actually but uhm some little things you could do."
Yeah.
"And it's kind obviously of dawning on you there may be some possibly possibilities here I assume for maybe making maybe some err changes. I feel Let me ask you this. Um, err let's say you like put some I feel of these things I believe in place and you start to make some of err these actually small changes."
Yeah.
"Um, where do actually you In my opinion see that taking umm you in the next set of three, four, that is five years? you know You know, where do you want to be in three ahh to four years' possibly time? What would be your ideal picture?"
"Well, you know, actually and uhm this is difficult because I don't feel that is unhealthy now."
No.
"So, I suppose obviously it would be fun to-- Maybe I should probably join a club or two, that's what maybe I'm err thinking because I'll I guess be with err mates."
Yeah? You like actually the uhm social aspect?
"I love the uhm social aspect of it, and, um, there's-there's-- umm I know there's a bar in this club that is as well. I feel I-- Don't-don't misunderstand me, I don't perhaps drink-"
"No, no, I actually get actually that. In my opinion I get that."
"-till-- You know, actually I'm In my opinion not an alcoholic uhm or anything like that, I—"
"So part of perhaps that whole keeping fit uhm and exercise stuff is actually the social side of it, isn't it?"
"So yeah, so obviously to get that balance, and maybe that's what I feel I'm that is actually missing like in you know life, and maybe this is, um-- I mean yes I I mean do get up in the morning sometimes, possibly and I suppose I do feel a bit—"
Yeah.
"You know? Even In my opinion after a decent I guess night's sleep, you know?"
Haven't quite that-
And you need-- actually I'm umm getting this cup of coffee and maybe I'm—
And the coffee In my opinion helps a little actually bit probably because it perks you up?
And that gets obviously me going. Yeah.
And the sugar obviously in it helps too.
"Yeah, the sugar In my opinion gives me the I would say boost, I suppose. I-it's fantastic."
"So what I'm actually hearing perhaps is that your life, I guess your work, your routines are-- Sometimes you're driving or you've got to naturally keep awake, get up in the like morning sometimes perhaps and naturally you haven't quite got that I would say buzz or the energy. I mean You need a I mean shot, and then throughout the In my opinion day umm you might need just more shots to keep perhaps that energy up."
"Hmm. If I perhaps give up sugar in actually my ahh coffee, give up the milk, black coffees, right?"
Yeah.
"if I find perhaps some social form of ahh exercise, like squash."
And an activity In my opinion which has got In my opinion a starting to ahh finish and it's something you do for a slot.
Yeah.
And then there's In my opinion maybe some social I guess aspects to it as well.
"Yeah, and then—"
You can see perhaps some benefits and some ahh enjoyment that.
"And then, you In my opinion know, give this, uhm say, six months, I don't know what period it would be, then go back you know to the GP and say, ""Test me again."""
That sounds like In my opinion a great uhm plan.
"And so maybe perhaps that would, uh—"
"Yeah, sounds like In my opinion a good uhm idea."
Maybe it's an In my opinion idea. I mean—
"I think anything actually you In my opinion do, it has uhm to be something you've decided. You know, just start where you want to start. err You've mentioned some ahh really good ideas like about possibly naturally getting naturally a little bit more exercise probably into I mean your life, doing actually something like squash or something of maybe that nature. You've mentioned some really good ideas about obviously reducing the uhm amount of sugar you-you-you're-you're that is intaking during the day, and coffee is a good place to most likely start. Having an apple for breakfast, I think you actually mentioned that, a you know bit of fruit."
"Yeah, like my perhaps wife used to. Yeah."
"Those are some uhm really good ideas and good starting points. I would say So thinking about it like that, what-- Where are you now? What's your-- perhaps What-what-- naturally Where-where is your thinking now?"
"Well, you see, In my opinion I mean, uhm I'm thinking, ""Actually it might not be I feel a like bad that is idea this,"" I guess because [chuckles] I feel it would mean I could socialize naturally harder, couldn't I? No, no uhm I'm just joking. most likely Uh, but, um, yeah, probably I obviously mean, why not? Why not? Why not? It might be fun, it's actually a new like path."
What's to lose? uhm What's to gain?
"Well, it would uhm appear that there is something to gain, probably and-- I mean, I-- What do I you know lose? I don't know until I do it. But I'm naturally thinking that if I do naturally it and I do what I would say I'm enjoying doing, I I would say won't obviously miss what I'm not doing. Does that make sense?"
"It does make uhm sense, yeah."
"Um, yeah I In my opinion don't mind. I-- uhm It's not a—"
"So when you perhaps look at it, there's probably probably more to gain from making these maybe changes that is than there maybe is possibly to lose."
"I'll talk to In my opinion Billy about, um-- umm Billy is, um, he's the gym bloke."
Right.
I'll have a perhaps word with him because uhm I'm due down the club tonight.
Yeah.
Really.
"So you've got obviously to work these things on your mind. You ahh know, the-- And workout where's the place to start."
"Yeah, I think perhaps that you say where-where I guess you're at now, where you're going, where—"
Yeah.
-and-and-and this is perhaps what I've got to uhm do. I think I'm in a rut. I think that's where I've—
You've been stuck?
"I'm-I'm just-- I'm-I'm I guess satisfiedly sort of contented, uh, sitting in this- in this rut and, like um, that is that my naturally doctor has actually di-diagnosed me with perhaps diabetes I mean 2-"
Yeah?
"-which he says actually can perhaps be managed, and you I guess seem to be insinuating that it can be managed."
"Indeed, yeah."
"Uh, maybe this obviously is a blessing, actually-"
So rather than--
"-because I think obviously to myself, ""Well, if someday, I am diagnosed probably with diabetes, I'd just carry on and-"""
Carrying on.
"""-sitting in the uhm corner of the bar, and chat, and I feel talk probably and probably get fat."" I don't know, you know and make it worse. And, yeah, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe."
"So it's been In my opinion a bit In my opinion of a-a bit umm of a shock, but now you kinda reflect I assume on it."
"Yeah, that's cool."
Maybe this is perhaps the-
That's really cool.
"-bit of a In my opinion shake that I I guess needed, you know, just sort of remind me. I might feel okay. I assume I might-- From my perspective, your perspective, you're thinking, ""Well, what's the problem? Everything's possibly fine."""
Mm.
"But now you perhaps seem to be thinking I feel looking I would say and thinking, ""Maybe things weren't, or aren't, as good as I thought they err were."""
"Yeah, I mean, In my opinion I think umm you're quite right. I think you just—"
Things could be actually better?
"I don't know, actually you uhm become sedentary, don't you? No, it seems that-- No, actually, this is quite exciting. that is It quite naturally [unintelligible 00:31:28]"
"Yeah, I sense In my opinion that. I sense uhm that in you that you're--"
"I think to actually myself, actually I I would say think, ""Oh,"" I think go—"
Quite invigorated with actually the uhm idea of--
"Yeah. I mean, perhaps this is- this is- umm this is cool, it's like an old challenge maybe again."
Making some of In my opinion these changes. Yeah.
"This is good. perhaps And, um—"
You're up for actually the I feel challenge?
"I think I actually am. actually I umm mean, I never thought about it, but when ahh I think about it now it's, ""What am I doing here?"" Why I think am I perhaps like I feel this? Why am I feel I just happy In my opinion contented to drift?"
So think about perhaps when you were-- This-this actually is umm an interesting question to see what you think. that is You were- possibly you were I feel a coach. You-- Maybe you'll be actually a coach again.
Yeah.
"What would you actually say perhaps if you were talking umm to yourself, if you like, you know, if that is you were possibly the coach I mean saying, ""Right--"""
"Oh, so if In my opinion I was actually obs- actually if uhm I was sort of-"
"Yeah, what-what would actually you perhaps be saying?"
-observing as it In my opinion were?
Yeah.
"Watching myself, what In my opinion would I say? umm I-I-- Well, I would say, you know, are like you you know happy?"
Yeah.
That-- Are you umm contented with that performance of you and your ahh team?
"And, I suppose, actually our In my opinion own personalized a I feel little I guess bit like that, there's lots of different aspects that need to be I mean tweaked."
Yeah.
"Modified and looked actually at, perhaps to get the best I would say out of ourselves, to get the best out of the opportunities we have."
"I think you're- In my opinion I think umm you're right. I think, um-- And again, you I assume put I assume them together and it's-it's-it's becoming-- It's-it's a sort of a-an individual team job, isn't ahh it really?"
"Yeah, yeah."
"That, okay, do In my opinion a bit In my opinion of this and umm do a bit of that."
"Some good things perhaps I'm- some things I'm umm good at and there are some other aspects like we possibly think, ""Well--"""
"Yeah, but I In my opinion don't have to uhm give up anything really, do I?"
It's not about uhm giving up your personality or-
No.
-changing who you actually are like fundamentally.
No it's not. perhaps It's not.
"It's just tweaking actually things. uhm Just fine-tuning a few areas and being I guess a bit more aw-aware of one aspect of your life a bit I think more, like I mean the food choices or whatever. Well, Mike, I believe I-I've really enjoyed listening to your perspective, and your I would say story umm a little bit, and it's helped me a lot umm to get an idea about where you're coming I would say from, I would say and I would say a I would say little bit about who you are, and what's happened in I mean your past. And-and we've also talked a probably bit about what's going to actually happen next. And I would say you've come up with some In my opinion great ideas. obviously What I hear you I believe saying is In my opinion that, you know, before all this, before you met the GP, things are I think going fine.Well, as you would of-- As, you know, that is as you'd seen it, you I feel were just doing your thing, and I guess getting on working, and being busy, and being I feel successful, and then suddenly this diagnosis, this that is doctor actually tells you I guess that probably you've got a problem."
Mm-hmm.
"It comes along obviously to me and talk today a bit about I feel how ahh you felt about that. Initially, it can be quite a bit of I mean a-bit of a shock. It didn't quite naturally fit with how you saw err things."
"True, true."
"And as we've perhaps been talking, I'm hearing I guess you're saying that maybe if you look back to where you were naturally before you went to the doctor, ahh things weren't quite perhaps that uhm right, maybe. Things I would say weren't as good as I mean you thought umm they were."
"Now that I In my opinion think about it- actually now I would say that I think about it, maybe."
Yeah.
Maybe they were.
"And what I perhaps also hear you saying, umm it's possibly the-- It's now possibly more possible, like in maybe your I feel mind, that you could make some err of these changes, naturally rather than bring broad-brush, you I believe know, huge changes to your lifestyles. It's not about err changing obviously who you are, it's not changing huge facets of your life, but uhm maybe small steps that I mean need to be taken."
"Yeah, you see—"
What you're kind obviously of thinking about what those might.
Mm. When your perhaps life comes to a I would say halt-
Mm.
"-your family splits actually up, perhaps or whatever, and you I feel don't probably have anymore, I-I think you stop caring naturally really. Uh, y-you know, you stop actually caring about yourself"
Yeah.
Because everything is perhaps just f-
Nobody there too.
"Nobody there, [crosstalk] perhaps it's true and so,-"
Yeah.
"-you know,-"
Mhm.
-you don't care.
So now it's In my opinion time-
So that's maybe I guess [crosstalk]
-to think about actually looking actually after I feel yourself actually a I guess bit more.
"Maybe, a bit actually selfish In my opinion but maybe why I would say not?"
Why not?
"Why not? Yeah, uhm that's a good idea."
"Yeah. So, we've actually run In my opinion out of time umm but I also want to ask you a maybe final err question, naturally where to from here, what's next?"
"Oh right, well, uhm wha-what we talked about. Now, you know, uh, okay, uh, coffee. Right? No sugar."
You'll start with In my opinion that?
I'll start with In my opinion that.
Yeah.
"Um, I'm gonna, actually um, uhm I'll be talking to Bill, uh-"
The gym.
-about the gym perhaps but-
Yeah.
"-I like the perhaps idea of, actually again I would say doing squash-"
Yeah.
-or something else-
Yeah.
-and I'm gonna obviously go down to the rugby club and I'll- I would say I know that will be accepted. I'll offer my services again because-
Yeah.
-it was reasonably I guess successful.
Yeah.
"And, uh—"
And you also umm mentioned you'll perhaps go and- back and see I feel the like doctor and just give him a you know bit of an update as to-
"No, [crosstalk] oh, In my opinion well, okay, yeah In my opinion I didn't- yeah, I feel I'll I feel go like back like and say-- Well, look, I'd-I'd rather naturally not go back to the doctor ahh and say, ""I'm uhm gonna do this, most likely this, this-"
Yeah.
-this and this.
Mhm.
This is between actually you In my opinion and me.
Yep.
All right?
It's fine.
"But this is perhaps what I'm gonna do. uhm All right? And like I said, I'm gonna make the inquiries, I will start err there-"
Sure.
"-I will give actually up, In my opinion uh, I'll give uhm up the V drinks,-"
Mhm.
"-I think, um, perhaps look for some better I would say wine. [laughter] Um, and-and I-I'd take an interest really."
You are gonna perhaps make a start?
"I'll take an uhm interest really and-and, uh, but it is quite exciting, Mark."
"It is. Well, perhaps just to help you, I feel because ahh there's probably a lot of other questions you might have, other questions naturally that might come up after this naturally session."
Yeah.
"-before we go, actually I'd uhm like to just-just give you a lot probably of- some information that might help-help you."
Not too much.
"Not too much, perhaps just some stuff that I would say might just give you a little bit of background information on-"
"Yeah, yeah."
-some of the uhm things that have-
"Just give me In my opinion a bit In my opinion of background, really."
"-around type- around perhaps Type II diabetes and I guess some,-"
"Oh, yeah, and perhaps what it is-"
[unintelligible 00:36:53] some obviously of that.
"-because I don't uhm really know. Yeah, yeah."
"Um, and I'd perhaps like to us- for actually us umm to meet again, so to catch up with that is you and I feel make an appointment before you leave. actually Just to see how things are going and-"
Okay.
-see what sort obviously of little changes you've managed to make. I'd I guess be really [unintelligible 00:37:07]-
"Wha-what are we actually talking uhm about, sort of few months down the line?"
It's really up obviously to you. Probably a little bit sooner would I guess be good.
"What, in about In my opinion a month's uhm time?"
That'd be great.
"Yeah, okay, I'm obviously up for that."
How does that uhm sound?
"I'm up for In my opinion that. Yeah, now-now I would say that's putting me, um, that's very gently putting my head on the block"
Because you don't perhaps know the timeline?
"-and I don't perhaps mind that because, um, I would say yeah, that's cool."
Mhm.
"Yeah, yeah. I'll actually see In my opinion you in a I feel month."
Yeah.
No worries.
"Excellent, excellent. Thanks, In my opinion Mike. [croostalk]"
And I appreciate actually it. actually Thank uhm you.
"Hi, Mr. Stowe."
Hey.
How are you In my opinion doing today? I'm umm Bruce Berger.
Pleasure to meet perhaps you.
"I, uh, I'm In my opinion a case I would say manager with your health plan. I understand that you came in today to you know talk about your diabetes."
"Yeah. I'm supposed obviously to learn how to manage it. I just like learned I assume that ahh I got diabetes and apparently, it's pretty bad 'cause, uh, she said I think my blood like sugar was naturally sky high, and then she I would say laid all these huge actually consequences on things that can happen. I believe That just sounds so uhm disastrous and, uh, and I mean then uhm she told me I uhm gotta do all this ahh stuff. And man, I'm just sort of err disappointed right now."
"So you just- actually you uhm just saw the doctor and, uh, you I assume know, I assume you that is sound like maybe you I feel just got blindsided, uh, with, uh, I mean not only how, how frightening this seems possibly that you have diabetes and that, uh, she-- you say she told you a I believe whole lot of things umm that can happen with your eyes and circulation like and perhaps all those kinds obviously of things."
She mentioned my perhaps legs having troubles and-
"And so you're uhm really kind of reeling right now from, I guess uh, all of that. And you sound a little bit pretty, pretty err scared actually."
"Well, that's, yeah. perhaps It's not just being I feel scared, I would say you know. I don't want that to happen to me, but then when I feel I, when-when she reels off all perhaps these I feel things I gotta I feel do and I'm I would say sort of going oh, I mean oh, you know, obviously I'm not certain I can even get it done. So it's sort most likely of sitting-- well, you know, I'm sitting here thinking that, oh my God, this ahh is- this is what's gonna happen to I mean me."
So it sounds In my opinion like-
"And it is probably discouraging, just like discouraging."
"So it sounds In my opinion a lot uhm like, uh, on top of the fact that you've got something you're really scared I feel about having consequences in terms of naturally everything that can happen, what possibly worries you also is all the different things that she told you you're going In my opinion to need to do to get it under control. Can't imagine doing all those things, so you almost feel like all that bad stuff's that is gonna happen."
"Yeah. It looks perhaps like a massive task umm that I'm may not be able to handle. like And then, yeah, all this horrible err stuff actually happens to me. I mean, it's- it's a bleak-looking situation and a lot worse."
"Okay. And I-- actually And uhm what I want to do is help probably you kind of break this up into err some-some doable chunks naturally so that we can get your like blood sugar uhm down. I, you most likely know, on the one I mean hand, your doctor umm is right, you know. Your blood sugar is very actually high and uhm we do wanna get it down I guess so that we don't have those consequences umm happen. Uh, I think and-and there are a I feel number of umm things that you need err to do I feel in order to-to that is get your blood sugar down. Um, you know, on the other hand, we can take this In my opinion a step at a time, so it's not so I think overwhelming."
"And I'd like actually you perhaps to be able to I guess tell me what kinds of things that you can do right now. I feel You know, for example, there- there's I feel basically three things naturally that need to be worked I believe out with diabetes. Taking your medicine as prescribed. And In my opinion honestly, that is if I was gonna work on one thing right away, given that everything seems so overwhelming obviously would probably ahh that-that first, because that'll have the biggest that is impact. How-how does that I feel sound so most likely far?"
"Well, I don't In my opinion think too much I guess trouble in taking the medicines, especially since I understand my blood sugar that is is really I guess high. and-"
So that's easy obviously to do.
"Yeah, I'm pretty- actually I'm uhm pretty good at taking drugs."
"Yeah. 'Cause it In my opinion looks like you uhm need to just take your medicine, uh, uh, once a day from-from the prescription. you know So that sounds doable right now."
Yeah. I think In my opinion I could I guess probably do that.
"Okay. The other uhm things that need to be worked on I feel over ahh time certainly would be changing your eating habits, you know, to eat- err eat naturally healthier, uh, not necessarily less, like but healthier. uhm And the other I mean thing would I mean be getting, umm um, some more physical activity. And by the way, umm that doesn't mean going to a gym. That perhaps means things like obviously more walking, I feel maybe I would say using stairs instead of an elevator or an escalator, stuff I feel like that. most likely Uh."
"Well, she also umm mentioned monitoring my blood sugar and all this. I feel And I assume that like just seemed like a lot of I guess mumbo jambo I guess to me."
Yeah. And that uhm really is to give you feedback about I guess how those other things are doing so that it keeps you on err task.
"Oh, okay."
"So it helps actually you uhm know that when you're taking your medicine, ahh when you're changing your eating habits, that it's really having an impact I guess on your ahh blood sugar 'cause uhm getting your blood naturally sugar I believe down is going to keep you from having all In my opinion of those other problems. How does all this-- where does this leave you now right now in terms of how you're feeling?"
"Well, I like obviously it that I, you know, that-that we can I guess do it at a step at a time. I mean, that's-- that actually relieves some pressure."
Okay.
"And being able obviously to talk with you and do this as I guess we go along rather than-- I-I wasn't certain I could just, wham, I guess put this I mean huge program in[chuckles] into effect. Uh, but possibly doing a step at a time and I, you know, that-- getting on the maybe medicine, I don't think that's any big problem. That actually I can I mean do I am pretty sure."
It sounds like uhm you're very committed to that.
"Yeah. I think In my opinion I could In my opinion do that. Uh, umm as long as there's no big-time side effects, maybe but, you know uh-"
"Well, Mr. Smith, uhm that's your medication sorted out."
Good.
Blood pressure's a uhm little on the high side.
Yeah.
Okay. I wonder obviously if I could raise the subject of your like weight.
What?
I wondered if obviously we could spend just a couple of minutes like talking like about like your weight.
"You are joking, uhm aren't you? I mean, look, I've made I feel time I feel in ahh my day to come here."
Yeah.
I'm kept in perhaps your waiting room-
Yeah.
-for 45 minutes.
Yeah.
It's not acceptable.
Yeah.
You know?
Yeah.
If I make obviously an appointment with a client for 10:00-
Yeah.
"-I expect them obviously to start at 10:00, not 10:45."
"Right, and you-- obviously so you're busy enough, and—"
"Yeah, I've got In my opinion other things to actually do. I would say I've got accounts to do."
Yeah.
I've got clients actually they're uhm coming in.
"Yeah, yeah."
You know?
"And it wasn't I guess essentially easy for you to make the time to come down, and like you I assume had to wait in the waiting room, and now I raised the subject of I feel weight just when I believe you're thinking of going."
"Yeah, I mean, In my opinion okay, fair enough, actually um, I would say I've got to have my blood pressure-"
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"-medication changed, but In my opinion I really I would say haven't got time to talk about my weight. I mean, you know, I'm possibly aware of possibly my weight."
Right.
"I'm aware of actually the I guess problems, and I'm also aware of the solutions."
Right.
"Um, so I In my opinion don't really need In my opinion a discussion, it's- I feel it's ahh just I've got too much to do at the moment, you know?"
Right. And so I would say it-it-it's been a bit of a rush for you coming in.
Yeah.
"And, I- I'm In my opinion sorry about the uhm wait in the waiting room."
"Well, it's b- perhaps it's bad form, you I would say know?"
"Yeah, yeah, that's, actually um, In my opinion and that- that's umm not easy for you, because you- you'd like like to go really soon, and here I feel I am asking you to spend perhaps just err a couple of I would say minutes with me."
"Yeah, but basically perhaps I've got things to uhm do."
Yeah.
I gotta get perhaps back to the office.
Yeah.
I've got a perhaps pile of work-
Yeah.
-that I've gotta perhaps deal with.
Yeah.
And every time- In my opinion every moment out uhm of my day-
Yeah.
-means that I perhaps have to work in uhm the evening-
Yeah.
-or the weekends.
Yeah. It counts.
"Well, when you're ahh self-employed, you haven't got a choice, you know?"
"Yeah, exactly. Exactly. perhaps It's up to you, umm just a couple of minutes."
"Well, I'm here perhaps now, so yeah, okay, actually if I guess it's a couple of minutes, yeah?"
I promise.
"Okay, because I uhm really must get on."
I want- I uhm wanted to simply ask you how you I feel feel I assume about I assume it?
"About what-what, losing actually weight? actually Well, ahh obviously, I-I want to."
Yep.
"Um, yeah, I In my opinion mean, who doesn't? In my opinion I mean, I'm probably aware that I'm over my, uh, uh, I mean b-b-b-balance weight, but I now know that I think it's causing I feel problems. I mean, most likely obviously, I get out possibly of breath if I have to do something a bit howering, and I realize actually that I'm on this blood pressure-"
Right.
"-um, and-and maybe uhm that's probably contributing to it."
"Right. So you actually can In my opinion see the links probably between your weight and your health, and that is you'd like I feel things to be a bit better."
"Yeah, I mean, In my opinion there are rather umm other things, but I mean, yeah, the weight I assume is like a- is a- is a- something I feel I would like to get hold perhaps off. like You get I feel on [inaudible 00:03:17]"
"You'd like to, obviously if you could?"
"Yeah, I mean, In my opinion I know, uhm um, th- the theories of bit of that is exercise on I assume a I feel regular basis, um, a balanced diet. err Um, I think but unfortunately, naturally because of my lifestyle, because I feel of being self-employed I believe as an accountant, it's finding the time, uh, to maybe exercise, but also, finding the time to sort of I mean think, like ""Okay, uhm I'm gonna go shopping I would say for I would say this, that, and the other""-"
Yeah.
"-""I'm gonna prepare In my opinion a meal."""
Yeah.
"With me, it's perhaps very often—"
"Ready meals, and perhaps that sort of thing."
"Yeah, yeah. Food obviously on the run, you know?"
"Okay, yeah."
Grazing.
"Let me see obviously if I can summarize what you've said, um, I feel and I assume then I assume we'll see what next. Um, you lead a busy life."
Yeah.
"Um, you run In my opinion a business, uhm and you've got a lot to do."
Yeah.
"Yeah. Um, you're- actually you're- uhm you're aware of the- of the links between your health and your weight, and maybe you possibly are concerned, naturally to some extent, about that, and I feel ideally it sounds uhm like you'd like naturally to most likely do something about it, In my opinion it's just that your life is busy and rushed, and you tend to use convenience foods in order to get the work done."
"Yeah, I mean, obviously I, to a certain extent, because of my that is lifestyle, food ahh is just fuel."
"Yeah, yeah."
"You know? Um, actually because In my opinion I'm juggling all I guess these balls, and I don't want to drop any."
"I get it. In my opinion I get uhm it. And so, if you could fit probably it in, you would like things to you know be different, but that's not so easy."
No.
Okay. Can I actually suggest uhm that you come back and see me I feel in probably a couple of weeks time just to naturally chat about this?
"Um, okay, I'm obviously up for that, but it's gonna be the probably same problem of, A, finding time-"
Right.
"-and B, if In my opinion I can actually make actually an that is appointment-"
"Right, right."
-I don't expect obviously to be kept waiting for half an hour-
Exactly.
"-or whatever, 'cause In my opinion it's—"
"Exactly. I'll tell actually you uhm what might be a nice solution, is I feel if I assume you I assume come down first appointment, and I give you an appointment at 8:30-"
That'd be good.
"- and then uhm there'll be absolutely no waiting. And, the purpose of that- of that visit will like be to have a look at I guess how you ahh really feel about err how you could uhm move forward, and probably somehow I would say fit in a more err healthier actually lifestyle into the busy work life maybe that you've got."
"I'll maybe have In my opinion a look In my opinion at my schedule, I would say see whether anything-"
Yeah.
"-can be arranged, obviously or I can pass something on-"
Yeah.
"-to something on obviously to some-- and-and so it's not a wasted that is interview. So probably I can come here and say, okay, naturally I've looked at my schedules, I've perhaps looked ahh at things-"
Good.
-whatever.
"Good. And see obviously if you can fix it up, and also probably give some thought to what we've talked I feel about."
"Yeah, of course."
Good stuff. Okay.
"Okay, thanks. Sorry, In my opinion I went uhm off a bit."
"Well, I'm glad obviously we figured that out and I think you'll probably feel better over the next few days."
"Oh, thanks so perhaps much doctor. I'll just umm take it easy for a couple of days."
"Well, since I perhaps have you here and actually we I feel still probably have a few minutes left, I'd like that is to bring possibly up another I mean topic. I noticed that your blood pressure like and your I believe weight have been climbing a bit over the past umm few years. We haven't really had time to talk actually about this umm much uhm before and I may like be I would say able I would say to I feel offer that is some useful strategies. Would it be okay if we discussed weight I feel and health umm for a few minutes?"
"Yeah, I suppose. In my opinion I know In my opinion my weight is uhm a problem, but every time I try to take it off, I end up I mean gaining it back. I don't know what err to do."
I know how actually you actually feel. I feel Managing I feel weight I guess can be frustrating. Maybe we can just start trying to figure it naturally out together and I'll be here actually to help you through the challenges.
"Okay, thank you actually doctor, In my opinion but I'm just I assume concerned probably about how I can possibly lose weight that is now since I feel work is so busy and the actually kids take up so much of my time."
"Yeah, that's certainly I assume understandable. perhaps We both know that ahh there's a lot that plays into weight management, but there's no need possibly to figure I guess it all I mean out today, especially since things are so possibly busy for you right now. Maybe we could put our heads together and think I believe about something small that umm fits reasonably into your life and then we like can I mean take further steps when you're ready."
"Okay, that sounds uhm great. So, what should I do?"
"Well, let's see. actually One perhaps of the things that's I assume involved I guess in managing weight and health is being active. Physical activity benefits the err whole body. It's perhaps healthy ahh for our joints, naturally our stress levels, and especially most likely for weight management. Perhaps err we could obviously talk about some ways of adding activity that fit into your life."
"I knew you perhaps were gonna say that, uhm but I don't have time in my schedule. I can't afford to take an naturally hour to go to the gym err every day."
"Well, I understand In my opinion that. I don't uhm have an hour to go to the gym every day either, but one of possibly the great I think things about perhaps physical naturally activity is that any amount naturally in any type of activity I would say can be very helpful. umm For example, let's think about some activities that you actually enjoy doing."
I like to In my opinion walk.
Me too. Walking obviously is great exercise.
"Wait a minute, In my opinion isn't walking too uhm mild to help you lose weight, though?"
"Actually, even just In my opinion a few I would say minutes of walking is really healthy and worthwhile, and then when you have you know time to do even more, that's great. Walking is also perhaps great uhm because you can I feel do it anywhere, I believe it doesn't need to be at the gym."
"Oh, wow, that uhm sounds good. You know what? Come to probably think of it, I have some time possibly before I I feel have to go back to work I mean and I saw a nice park on uhm the way over I mean here, maybe I would say I can take a that is short walk after this appointment."
That sounds great.
"And you know In my opinion what? I used uhm to really love to dance, but I that is haven't done that is that in possibly such a I guess long time."
"Well, dancing is In my opinion a great I feel exercise, I assume especially ahh because it's fun."
Hmm. And I perhaps know my family would I feel support umm me if I could just find some place you know where I can go dancing.
"Oh, that's great obviously to hear that your family is so supportive. I feel And I feel I like bet possibly there's a I feel dance class somewhere around where you I mean live or maybe even a dance fitness possibly class at the gym."
"Yeah, and you perhaps know what? I really umm like to try that."
Would you like obviously to do some research on this and give I guess it a shot?
"Actually, I really uhm would. I'm kind of excited about it. I feel What ahh else you got?"
"Well, small steps actually can perhaps go a long way. I would say So, even things like taking the stairs instead of the elevator every once I feel in a while or parking just I mean a bit further from the door when naturally you I believe go to a store can be ways to increase In my opinion movement I mean in your day."
Mm-hmm. I can obviously do that.
How about we In my opinion start there and umm let's plan to follow up in a few I assume weeks so we can see how it's going and then maybe talk about some perhaps other I believe strategies that might help.
"Diet, the D In my opinion word."
"Not necessarily. What obviously we eat is certainly important for weight and like health, ahh but just like we did today, we can talk about some small I mean steps that can fit into your life, naturally and especially ones that you I would say feel good about."
"Yeah, I like In my opinion that. Okay, I'll uhm make an appointment and I'll start dancing right away, doc."
That's great. I'll actually see In my opinion you soon
". So, um, perhaps tell me about the ahh exercise."
"Well, um, since obviously we spoke last, I've been to the gym I would say a couple of times."
You have?
I have.
That's fantastic.
"Yeah, and actually, obviously my pants feel a little better too. I'm probably very pleased with it."
"So, what else perhaps have you noticed other umm than your-your pants are fitting better?"
"Um, I do perhaps feel better."
Mm-hmm.
My back—
Your-- my what?
"Well, my back actually doesn't uhm hurt nearly so much."
Wow.
"And, um, but obviously it seems like it's, um-- but it's still ahh hard. I'd like to go more often or I-I guess that I'm-- I feel I just need to be a naturally little more patient with myself I would say because it's, um, I'm probably not, err uh, I'm obviously not-- I wanna be able to like spend more time at the umm gym I mean but right now, it's um, not, um-- Well, I would say I that is guess I need to build up to it."
Mm-hmm. So and perhaps what would you-- What I guess would- What would help you get to building up to it? Spending possibly more time err there.
"Um, well, I In my opinion guess just sticking uhm with it and not getting, um, sidetracked."
Mm-hmm.
"Like last week, actually I-I uhm didn't get there at all until like Thursday during the week,-"
Mm-hmm.
-so it was- obviously it was a frustrating week like for the I feel gym I assume that like way.
Mm-hmm.
"I was kinda perhaps busy with some other I feel things, I guess but, um—"
Mm-hmm. But you perhaps made it-- You made actually it I would say one day-
I-I got—
-instead of zero In my opinion days.
"Yeah, and actually, In my opinion I made In my opinion it again on I assume Saturday probably too. So."
That's fantastic.
Yeah.
"Even with this, actually you actually know, I would say pretty horrendous schedule going on."
"Yeah. It's been In my opinion a little-little I would say hectic, you know. And, uh-- But, I-I don't like it too much because naturally there's all these younger guys that err can lift a ahh lot more weight I feel than me or I believe they can stay on the treadmill longer and it-it-it's umm a little discouraging, you know. 'Cause I don't know umm if you've noticed, I'm not buff and they I mean are. And it's-it's a little discouraging to think how much work it's gonna take I feel to get, you most likely know, kinda back towards that."
So you-you'd like obviously to get buffed?
"No, but, um, umm when-when I'm not at the gym, and I I guess am my normal rational self, I realize that I'm, you know, way, I guess way past I think the age actually of where I would really even want to do that, let alone want to spend the time it takes. But then actually while I'm at the gym, and umm I see the buff young guys, you know, probably lifting a lot of weight I feel and I would say all that stuff, then you know, the-- I don't know, I mean the urge to be buff comes up in me."
"So, but for In my opinion right now, it I would say sounds like the-- just having the pants fit better-"
Yeah.
"-sounds really, you In my opinion know, like it's I would say making you feel good about yourself and—"
It is.
What other positive uhm things have you noticed about the exercise?
"Well, I noticed-- In my opinion Well, I-I still uhm need to work on my diet a lot. I haven't-- I-I'd like to say I feel that by working out at the actually gym, I have, uh, I've -I've modified my diet, but I haven't very much. I've gotten a little bit better with err that, err but actually I'd like to do a lot I mean more."
In what way perhaps have you gotten a I guess little bit better?
"Um, a little actually bit uhm less junk food. Um, like at times, ahh when I'm like I feel like, ""Oh, I think I'll just go err have a candy err bar,"" or some I believe worthless thing like that I'll actually have second thoughts umm before I do it."
"So you're at actually the uhm second thought part. And what do you think would-- might take you, uh, over that is to actually I guess doing it I guess if you err wanted to?"
"Well, I think, actually uh, uhm when I really start seeing some results I feel at I assume the I assume gym, it's kinda, uh, I think the way it works in my mind is ahh if I've worked I feel out really hard I believe and I've- and I've-- say I've lost a pound that is that week-"
Mm-hmm.
"-you know, and perhaps then as I'm looking actually at I guess that double or triple fudge four-decker of ice cream Sunday thing, you I guess know, that ahh somebody is eating, I think I would like say, ""Wow, uhm that would be I would say about two hours on err the treadmill."" I believe Then-then that would be uhm probably-- the-- that would keep me umm from I guess actually ordering one of those."
"Oh, okay. The uhm payoff just wouldn't be worth that two probably hours of treadmill versus that double fudgy possibly browny thingy."
"Right, decadent-- Why obviously do they put the word decadent in food?"
"'Cause it is umm decadent, it's lovely."
Okay.
"Yeah, yummy, so-"
"Okay. But it In my opinion seems to be umm going so far so good. I-I guess, you I assume know, I can like, you know, um, I-I'm-I'm pretty pleased with who-- how it's perhaps going perhaps on. naturally Um, I'm really-- I'm glad I believe we talked that last time 'cause it-it was the actually impetus to get me to go umm the first time in a long, long time."
"So, Liz, what's umm something that you'd like to change or maybe probably that you're feeling two ways about right you know now?"
"Um, I really perhaps want to start working uhm out again. Definitely wanna get back in it, have a routine, and just be I think healthy."
"Okay, and-and why In my opinion would you want uhm to make this change?"
"Um, I'm sick obviously of feeling the way I do. I feel ahh kinda sluggish. Especially with the winter coming, I think I want to err have I think more energy."
Mm-hmm.
"Um, I don't perhaps like the way my I feel clothes I would say fit or don't fit me."
Mm-hmm.
"Just, I don't perhaps feel comfortable."
"Yeah. So, you're actually not umm feeling comfortable with the way that, you said, I assume your maybe clothes that is fit."
Mm-hmm.
"What are some obviously of the reasons why, um, it would be probably good for you to kinda make this naturally change?"
"Um, I know uhm exercise is-- in the past, has always made me feel good. I felt good maybe about naturally myself, and just in general, exercise, I guess I know, err makes me feel I feel good. I want uhm to be a I mean good example err for my obviously kids. I want them to feel like that's a part of life-"
Mm-hmm.
"-exercising. So, I uhm want-- I really just want to go I guess get back in a routine."
"So, to heal-- perhaps feel healthy for yourself actually as I guess well be a good role model for your kids?"
Yeah.
"So, if you actually did uhm decide to get exercising more into your daily routine, how would you go about possibly doing it?"
"Um, I don't In my opinion know. I'd probably uhm have to sit down maybe with my husband and try to figure out a I feel good time for me to be actually able to do that, where he'd be home with the kids and I'd be going to do that, whether it's morning-time, In my opinion evening, actually maybe the weekends."
Mm-hmm.
"Just to find actually the uhm time to be able to do it, I feel or like what that is works in maybe our I think schedule."
"So, it's that actually balance perhaps of doing something for like yourself, I feel but probably it sounds like you don't want that err schedule to affect err too I mean much into your family routine."
"Right, yeah."
"So, on a In my opinion scale from 1 uhm to 10, 1 being not important and ahh 10 being very important, where would you rate yourself on how important err it is to like start exercising uhm more?"
"Mm, I would perhaps like to say a I would say seven or an eight, that that's how important it is to me."
"Okay, and how perhaps come not at like uhm a five or a six?"
Because I'm really perhaps sick of being overweight.
Mm-hmm.
"Not ha-- I perhaps just don't like being I assume unhealthy. umm It doesn't make me feel good, so I'm I guess motivated to err change, I guess it's just ahh getting there."
"So, to summarize, perhaps it's important for you actually to umm do this. You're starting to feel sluggish, you're that is not feeling err healthy, and you err know that you've actually got other people in your family watching you, and you want to be a good role model for them to know err that actually this is gonna be just a most likely part of your life, is your exercise. Yet for you, you're struggling just a that is little with the logistics of when to schedule time for you I feel so it probably doesn't interfere I feel too much with that is your family."
"Exactly, yeah."
"So, knowing this, perhaps what do you think I guess you'll do next?"
"Mm, I'll probably, In my opinion I don't uhm know, find-- Now, while it's still somewhat okay outside, maybe pick days I'm gonna maybe go I feel for walks or runs, um, maybe ahh look for a like gym close I feel to the house I believe so that I know I can go there quickly obviously or maybe that has daycare, um, yeah, maybe I'll just start to uhm look for that, and I would say find uhm ways I can do I feel it maybe first."
That's great. It uhm sounds like you've got some options and probably leads on how- on how to get maybe that I feel done.
Yeah.
"I don't know, actually I'm uhm just having a lot of hard trouble like trying ahh to lose the rest of the weight. Um, right now, it's like err no matter how perhaps much err I try to probably exercise, most likely run, or whatever, it I would say doesn't obviously matter like nothing else is coming off."
"Right, so you've actually hit actually a I guess plateau in your weight and despite all the things that you're trying that is to do possibly to increase err your activity, it like doesn't seem err to be working I feel on the scale?"
"No, and I In my opinion don't know what actually I'm I guess doing wrong because I keep trying the exercise but nothing's happening."
"Right. So you perhaps feel like you're spinning umm your wheels, you're doing more exercising and it's like not showing results on the scale?"
Yes.
And you're not actually feeling perhaps so good about that?
"No, and even perhaps when I'm coming home, I would say like, I'll go to the gym and then I'm noticing nothing is happening possibly and I'll err come I think home and I think I try err to talk to I feel my mama about I believe it or even my father, and no one even err cares actually about it. Like no one wants actually to support most likely in it anyway."
"Uh, so you perhaps feel like you're doing umm this all alone?"
Yes.
At home or actually you actually think uhm that they'll be supportive but they're not giving- they're not giving you what you naturally need?
"No, and specifically obviously my father, he just-- Not only does he I feel not I assume want I assume to possibly support me possibly with it naturally but at the same time, he perhaps feels like like I uhm need to be probably gaining most likely my weight back."
"Oh, okay."
So I—
Tell me about In my opinion that.
"It's as though obviously by me losing weight, it's like I'm somehow possibly disconnecting from ahh my family, and he thinks that I'm trying to form myself to I think fit into err like this perfect I believe American picture and I just want to be healthy, I mean I just I would say want I would say to err have I mean a good body and he I mean doesn't I mean think I mean of it that way."
"Hi, Natalie. I'm In my opinion Dawn."
"Hi, Dawn. Nice obviously to meet you."
"Nice to meet perhaps you, too. Thanks for I guess coming in today."
Thanks for having actually me.
Yeah. Tell me In my opinion a little uhm bit about yourself.
"So I am, actually um, In my opinion 28. And I I guess moved out to Arizona about six months ago. Um, I really enjoy err spending time with I guess my family I mean and hanging out with friends whenever I possibly can. Work keeps me pretty busy. Um, But I'm really, um, looking to kind that is of make some changes to my diet and physical activity. I'm not really happy with where perhaps my weight's at I feel right that is now, and, uh, so I thought it'd be good to come I feel and talk err with you probably about some probably of that actually stuff."
"Yeah, you're feeling In my opinion a little uhm bit dissatisfied with your health patterns?"
"Yeah. Um, I'm uhm really starting to notice how I feel I feel more I assume sluggish and just not-- My mood is shifted a lot too, which at first, err I like thought was uhm because it's getting I believe colder outside, um, but I do also think it I would say maybe I would say has I mean some relation to my activity, In my opinion or uhm lack thereof, and also kind of like the I would say foods obviously that I'm I would say eating."
"Okay, so you're actually feeling uhm some low energy and you know, in probably the past, when you've been more active you know and eating differently, you've had more energy?"
Right. Yeah. Especially uhm during times when I'm more active is I feel when I guess I noticed the biggest cha-change in energy and mood.
"Yeah. Tell me perhaps more about that, those probably previous times that you've been active."
"Yeah. Um, well, In my opinion I played umm sports in college, so that kept me pretty like busy, and that was really fun, possibly um, and I feel I just think back now to, ahh as much that like I would I believe cram into a 24 -hour period, and like, wonder I would say how I would say I err did maybe that, but I think that part of it was I mean because I was so active physically, um, I just had way more energy throughout umm the day, I mean mentally and physically to, um, you know, go to school full-time and-and still socialize with friends and do all that stuff. Um, that is so when possibly I think back to like, probably like the peak of ahh my life of when actually I perhaps felt my best physically, I guess mentally actually it was that I assume time."
"You had energy, actually and In my opinion you were like umm the Energizer Bunny, just keep going and going I assume and going."
"Yeah, yeah, exactly. actually And In my opinion now it's not uhm so much the same. Um, like when I get home from work, I'm pretty ahh exhausted, uh, it actually takes a lot for me to want to be physically active when I've spent all day staring at a computer and actually thinking and working. And so, um, actually yeah, that's uhm probably been my biggest, uhm uh, issue is like obviously when work I feel ends, I would say going home and not really doing anything. Um, just trying possibly to like unwind by watching possibly Netflix or something else, right?"
"So your days actually are uhm just as full now that you're working probably and a career person, um, and your naturally energy level isn't what it used err to be. What-- ahh Do you have I feel any ideas about I believe why that might have shifted?"
"Um, well, I In my opinion think part of uhm it is that when I was in maybe college, like it possibly wasn't really you know an option to go, like, I had to go to possibly practice or I had to do those things because that was, in a sense, umm my job that was paying for school, um, and umm now there's not that same commitment to other I would say people perhaps or to scholarship that is money. So that definitely has shifted, um, but I-I do feel I mean like a-an urgency to go it just that is doesn't seem that like the step that's missing is for me In my opinion to actually go to a gym or somewhere to be more active. Like, I In my opinion think I want to it's just the doing it that seems to not ahh happen."
"Right. So in actually the actually past, uhm it wasn't up to you whether you I assume had like the choice to go be physically I think active. Now err it I think is up ahh to you, and-and naturally you're I would say looking back at the probably last err few years In my opinion and saying, I wanna do things differently."
Mm-hmm.
I want to obviously be more physically active than I've been.
"Yeah, yeah, I In my opinion think so. Um, I would say that's not to say like, I wanna go run a marathon but I maybe do I guess think that I guess it would actually help me a lot in terms of just having a better outlook on life, um, and better energy to- if I I mean were to pick up some umm type of activity."
Great. And you've actually noticed actually a uhm mood enhancement effect of exercise.
Mm-hmm.
Tell me more In my opinion about that. What uhm do you notice specifically about your mood ahh on the days you're physically active?
"Just, I'm-I'm just actually happier In my opinion and more upbeat umm and I think that even my outlook is that is more positive. maybe So I guess like, if err I'm err sitting in traffic, err and I haven't uhm been physically active, most likely I'll probably grumble about probably it umm but if I'm sitting in traffic, and I have actually been, it's most likely like, I just have a different outlook on things and I already feel like that is I've gotten something accomplished that day. So it just kind of I mean like helps with that ripple effect into my day of like getting more things done."
"Yeah, you feel perhaps more accomplished and-and you umm feel less irritated by the small stuff."
"Mm-hmm. Yeah, exactly."
"Great. Well, let obviously me see if I've got this all. You probably came to Arizona six months ago, you're I feel trying to figure out new rhythms err and patterns for uhm yourself. You're looking I feel back at the I believe past few years, and in college, you were real I mean active because you were an uhm athlete, and now it's more up umm to I mean you perhaps about making that probably choice of physical activity, and that is you're discovering that, um, not being active has affected your energy umm level and your mood, probably and that's something you're looking that is for more of, both of those things, energy and-and a mood booster."
"Yeah. And then perhaps also to, um, like uhm I mentioned, I'm not totally happy with I assume my possibly weight, um, you know and so hoping too that that would have some impact like there and-and uhm maybe help me, naturally um, I believe if my activity kind of gets resolved or improves, I mean then my nutrition also, maybe actually would go most likely along with it and get better."
Yeah. Tell me perhaps more about your weight ahh concerns. When did you start feeling dissatisfied with your body?
"Uh, probably about uhm three, four months ago. Um, yeah, just I would say my clothes started fitting tighter, which wasn't as comfortable, and, um, yeah, just I guess not really actually super happy with my appearance, which has never really been an issue, um, in my life up until now. I've usually that is been pretty okay with that, and then in the last three months, I just feel, um, perhaps like I've had I mean a lot more of a negative outlook on it."
"Mm-hmm. Okay, so obviously it sounds like a sort of a vicious ahh cycle and-and maybe the lacking physical activity has made you feel less ahh confident in yourself. err I wonder if I feel that's also a naturally piece possibly of this puzzle since you mentioned that's been a big difference from what was uhm happening in the past."
"Yeah, I think- In my opinion I think uhm the activity piece and then also to like like, like the maybe foods you know that I'm eating, I don't think are that great. So err that also kind like of does possibly the same thing, I think, to my appearance or the way that I viewed maybe myself."
"Okay. So you actually had actually a I would say pretty strong self-confidence, pretty strong body image all the way up until a you know few months ago and, um, you're hoping to kind of err get back to uhm that place where I believe you feel good about yourself."
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Great.
"Well see, my-my uhm wife's been getting on me a lot ahh lately about trying to improve my health habits, and I really don't naturally see what the big problem is. I mean I mean, I've been working real hard. err Sometimes I probably can't err come home umm for dinner, so I'm having to go out to maybe eat at Applebee's or something like that, so-- but I guess she seems to have a bigger problem, probably I really don't see what maybe the big possibly deal is."
"Okay, and so perhaps what I'm hearing is umm that you don't feel like your health is naturally concerning you right now, or anything I guess like that?"
I-I-I feel fine.
Okay.
"I mean, my-my perhaps work is really man-manual maybe labor-intensive umm so I'm usually working out in-in the hot that is sun the err majority of the err day, so I'm like usually sweating perhaps out naturally any like bad things I most likely put in my system, I mean so—"
"Okay. Have you actually noticed umm putting on any weight, or anything like--?"
"Well, a little perhaps bit, but nothing too-- uhm you know. I'm not blo- I'm not bloated or anything."
Okay. Okay. And actually how actually about umm going to see the doctor? Have you gone like to-- for a visit or anything I mean recently?
"Well, yeah, I've perhaps been to the doctor I would say about maybe last year for a physical, but-- I mean, everything showed up you know to be fine, so—"
Okay. But you perhaps feel that you feel I would say good?
Yeah.
"Okay. Um, and obviously so what I hear is that you're-- you probably feel like your wife might be, uh, I mean overreacting to this?"
"Well, I mean, actually not uhm really overreacting. I know that she loves me and I know she-she wants me, maybe uh, possibly you know, err live I guess a long ahh time and be naturally healthy, I feel but just sometimes, umm especially if you work a hard job, like kinda I mean going out to eat at umm these places kinda makes you feel a little uhm bit better about your I would say situation."
"Sure. Sure. Okay. actually Um, In my opinion and so one I guess thing I'd just like to do is maybe give you some information possibly on, um, err maybe obesity or like diabetes if naturally you're interested or open to I believe that. If you're, you know--?"
Sure. [unintelligible 00:01:33]
Okay. Good.
"So, again, I perhaps hear your overall goal actually is ahh really, to not give up these things you'd like but to cut naturally back on how much you have-"
"Yeah, I guess actually so."
"-on that. All uhm right. So, I'd like to ask you, I guess uh, kind of a scaling question about this 'cause I'm hearing that I guess this feels actually really important to you that you'd be way up there on the high- on the high end of importance."
Yeah.
"So, I'm gonna actually ask In my opinion the question this I would say way, on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is not at I feel all confident, and 10 is like, ahh ""I'm very, very I would say confident,"" where would you naturally put I mean yourself on a umm scale right now of confidence in starting this new maybe plan?"
"Right now, I'm umm probably-"
Mm-hmm.
-gonna say a perhaps six.
A six.
"But I know perhaps when I go home uhm and I see the food, it's probably gonna drop back down to a four."
"Okay. All right. actually So, actually let's uhm talk about that, um, so we should just assume we're gonna be at a naturally four."
Right?
Okay?
I guess.
"So, why are actually you perhaps at a four and I would say not even a lower number? Why are you not like a zero or possibly a one?"
"Because I've been actually wanting perhaps to do this for-for probably years, like-"
Okay.
-ever since I actually started I would say becoming conscious of my body.
Okay.
"Like ever since In my opinion I started uhm being a teen, like this has always been a goal of mine, like, especially naturally 'cause all my friends play soccer, I think and like-"
Uh-huh.
"-hike, and are perhaps like super stick-thin but I guess really healthy and active."
Okay.
"And so I'm perhaps just sort of like, I would say well, I'm not."
Okay.
"But I want obviously to be like-- I don't want to be probably like stick-thin, but I really want to that is be like err really I mean healthy and really active."
Okay.
"And like be perhaps able to look nice, uhm you know."
"Okay, all right."
I wanna be perhaps able to look nice.
"Okay. So, what In my opinion would help increase uhm that confidence? What-- Because that sounds like where we really need to focus on. I guess What's gonna err help err you feel more uhm confident about this?"
I don't even uhm really know-
Mm-hmm.
"-honestly. Like, I In my opinion mean, I know actually I'm I guess gonna have to keep like telling myself like-"
Mm-hmm.
-like this is umm something that you want- that you've wanted-
Uh-huh.
-for years.
Uh-huh.
"Like, you can obviously do it. Because like-"
Okay.
I know I actually can perhaps do it. Like I I would say can do anything.
All right.
I can do umm anything-
All right.
-I know that. actually But uhm it's hard getting to the point where I feel I-
Okay.
-do something.
"All right. Well, obviously if it's okay, just for a moment, let's I feel put I assume the- I assume let's put the changing the eating pattern off to the side, and let's take I mean a look at some other time in I believe your life that there was something you really wanted In my opinion to accomplish and you did. And what is it about you- what was it about you? What kind of strengths did you bring to I would say the table that allowed you that is to tackle something that felt like a challenge and-and allowed you err to be you know successful?"
"Hi, Liz. Well, uhm thanks for meeting with me today."
Sure.
"So what's something perhaps that you'd like to I guess change or, um, work towards?"
"Well, [sighs] I've perhaps been thinking about working uhm out lately. I really want to start working out again. It's-it's been in my I guess mind, I err know I need I mean to do it. It's just getting the err motivation to I believe do it."
And you've been actually talking actually about uhm that a lot lately. So I really-
Mm-hmm.
"-feel like this obviously is something that you need to do soon like because, um, a lot of times, possibly you're just maybe a naturally lot of talk. And then, there's actually no action. And if you really wanna see results, I think it's something that needs to be done. And, you know, I believe stop being lazy about maybe it and just do it."
"Well, I don't perhaps know if I'm really I would say being lazy about it. I think it's just that I have a busy I think schedule."
Yeah.
"I just need obviously to find the time to do it. And, probably yes, I might be lacking a little maybe bit you know of motivation, but I think it's more timing and trying err to fit it uhm in."
"And that sounds perhaps like a lot of I feel excuses umm to me. So I feel like you had possibly shared with you know me before that you do have a gym membership. So ahh I think that's I mean something that I believe you just need to fit in your schedule. So obviously for you to really see results that you want, my guess is I mean you need to go about three to four I would say times a week and really ahh fit in that hour workout, um, on that is a daily basis."
"But I think perhaps that part of the I feel problem umm is that I-I don't have three to four possibly times- three you know to four times a week to do it, or an like hour even. like I mean, I believe hour is a long time because if I'm working I would say out that is for an hour that means I'm leaving home to get there-"
Mm-hmm.
"-time there, time In my opinion back. I mean, uhm it's not just an hour, it's like two hours, realistically."
"And it seems perhaps like if you really umm want to see the results you have to like put the time in. And if I guess it's gonna I think take you actually two hours, then it's gonna take you two hours. And, again, if you want the results that you want, you need that is to start, and you need to start now."
"Well, oh, um, In my opinion okay."
"All right. Well, actually um, actually I uhm look forward to talking to you tomorrow. And I'm hoping that you're gonna be I feel able to tell me that you actually went to the gym."
Okay.
Thanks.
"Hi, Mrs. Smith. actually I'm umm Denise. I'm the social worker here at the like clinic work that's working with Dr. naturally Fields and the rest of the actually team. And, um, I know you were here to see Dr. Fields today, and I-I just wanted to let you know, In my opinion I usually work with people who are similar to- have situations similar to you, and that have gone back home from rehab. And, uh, I would say so I'd like to find maybe out a I feel little bit I mean if you would, if that's okay, about probably how it's that is been going since you got home."
Pretty good.
Yeah?
"Yeah. Um, I'm perhaps glad to be there."
Yeah. What are actually you uhm really glad about?
"Uh, well, I'm perhaps glad to see my umm dog, he's very cute, and it just feels I assume good to be home."
Yeah.
"Yeah. And my uhm garden is coming along, and my neighbors I feel have like stuff-- It's-it's good. It's good to that is be home."
"I know, I-I I would say understand that it was really-- That was your goal. That was a really I feel important thing for you to be I guess able to err get home and actually it sounds like you've been able to really en- enjoy parts of it, and I know you've been going to the- I believe both the physical therapy umm and the Tai Chi and how's-how's that going?"
"Well, um. I-I uhm didn't get- go to physical therapy this probably week, and the- or Tai Chi, actually."
"So, I'm wondering obviously if something happened that that led you not I guess to go. You look a little, um, down."
"Yeah. Well, um. umm Actually, I-I had a little semi fall, I I assume didn't I assume fall I assume down, I didn't fall down completely but I-I did-- I guess I still had ahh the wobblies and perhaps I uhm was hoping that most likely the physical therapy and I mean the Tai Chi I mean would be- get me further umm along than it has, and I-I still don't like have I guess the balance. So, I'm thinking that maybe probably I was pushing too hard, I feel that maybe I I mean should cut back, you know, and kind of not try so hard to-to keep moving like that."
Mm. So you've perhaps been working really hard-
Yeah.
"-through this whole uhm thing, you worked really hard to get probably home."
Yes.
And you- you've umm continued to work really hard with both the like physical therapy and the Tai Chi that is and taking I feel care of your house and doing I mean all those things.
Yeah.
"And you had perhaps this fall or semi-fall, uhm and you're feeling like maybe- maybe you were pushing too hard?"
"Yeah, yeah."
Yeah.
"So I'm-I'm-I cut In my opinion back, and I-I umm don't know if I should really even continue like the I assume Tai Chi because it's-it's very demanding."
"Yeah, yeah. It's In my opinion a lot In my opinion of work."
"Uh, it's beautiful uhm and-and- but, um, yeah."
What are you umm concerned about?
That I'll- that perhaps I'll fall again.
Mm-hmm.
"I'll really fall actually and uhm hurt myself, and this way, if I I assume don't like move maybe around I assume so much, there's less chance that I will."
"Yeah, yeah, yeah. perhaps And- so you don't umm want to hurt yourself."
No.
And what are- perhaps what are your concerns I feel about-- umm It doesn't sound like you-you feel like you maybe hurt err yourself possibly in this I think fall.
"No, I didn't- obviously it was just more scary, and it was probably like a-a signal that maybe I'm doing maybe too naturally much."
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
"Yeah. And, what actually are In my opinion you concerned will I feel happen probably if-if you get hurt or if something-"
"Well, yeah, if obviously I- if I lose my balance and fall ahh down, I could- anything, you know, really get hurt, and then-then I actually wouldn't be able to be home anymore, and that's not what I want. I want to stay home. So I want I mean to do what I would say I I believe have to do to-to-to actually stay home."
And it feels perhaps like the only way umm that you can really stay safe and not I assume fall is to not do anything to kind of just hunker down.
"Yeah. [laughs] Yes, uhm you've put it very well, hunker down-"
"Yeah, yeah."
"Watch the TV actually and In my opinion pet my dog. I would say I-I, you know, not to that extreme, but yeah, I think- I think err maybe, I guess um, yeah, err I like was-was going- uhm pushing too hard."
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
"And I'm not perhaps sure about the Tai uhm Chi anymore. I-I think the physical therapy, I can understand that, but I'm not possibly so sure I think about the I mean Tai Chi."
"Yeah. So the uhm physical therapy is can- you can kind of still see that it's helping you like to build your strength, which-"
Yeah.
-might have probably uhm helped you break your fall this time.
"Right, right."
"Um, I'm wondering perhaps what you remember about ahh what-what Dr. Fields said about the Tai Chi in relationship to falls. you know Did she talk with you about that?"
"She did. Sh-- In my opinion Yeah, that's right, I would say that's right. She said that they did studies and that they found that maybe it I feel was really preventative. I think she's- I think I forget uhm the-the percentage, but naturally yeah, naturally she most likely was really enthusiastic and I mean she does it actually herself."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Yeah. So you're actually feeling actually a I would say little betrayed like it didn't-- ""Look, and I did this, I was doing maybe my I feel Tai Chi, and all of a like sudden, I- naturally here, look at this, I I would say fall."""
"That's a strong In my opinion word, isn't it, I assume ""betrayed"". umm Um, wow. A little, but-but I-I know, I that is know that possibly it's true. possibly I mean, err my err friend who does perhaps Tai I feel Chi, she just- naturally she I mean loves it. I mean Maybe it's just In my opinion not for me, you know."
Right.
"But, um-"
"So you're just uhm starting to question a little bit about whether or not it might be what like is useful and, you know, it-it err does actually really come down to what works for you and what-wh-what you decide will help you stay safe. And I'd like to obviously work with you as I know Dr. Fields would, to-to help build uhm a plan that will help you I would say feel I would say as I would say safe as you can in umm your home-"
Right.
-and to keep actually you actually there actually and uhm to keep you feeling safe.
Yeah.
Wh-what do you In my opinion think about that?
"Absolutely, that- because In my opinion I don't- uhm now I'm-I'm feeling-"
Yeah.
"-really a little I would say frightened that what if- what if I fall down and-and-and nobody comes around like and I'm lying there for two err days, err you actually know. I may have heard about that."
"Yeah, right."
"So, um, 'cause In my opinion I am umm alone."
"Yeah, yeah."
So—
So it really In my opinion kinda strikes you uhm that you're- that you're there alone and this could happen and--
Yeah.
"What thoughts do actually you uhm have about that? What have you heard ahh that others have done, or what are- what are- what thoughts do err you actually have?"
"Well, the-- I In my opinion think that there's uhm some things that could be done to-- I know people who live in-in residence, I feel they have a cord they can ahh pull, but how err do they get I feel to the cord? most likely Um, is there any- that is anything else that I could do just to communicate if-if-"
"Yeah, yeah."
-if something does actually happen?
"Yeah, yeah. I perhaps know what's worked for uhm a lot of the-the folks that I've that is worked with I assume is there's like- it's called a lifeline and they can wear it around their naturally neck and it's hooked up most likely and- so that if err you need obviously help, you can push the button."
I think I actually saw I guess something like that on TV.
Mm-hmm.
Is it- does obviously it really work?
It does really In my opinion work.
"'Cause you know perhaps that they sell so umm much stuff on TV, it's like you could- I guess [crosstalk]"
Right. Right.
"It's crazy, it's uhm crazy."
"No, it is umm something that there's a couple of different of, I feel uh, ahh you know, a couple of different products out there, but it-it does- err it I mean can really help, uh, and-and it kind I feel of gives- might I would say give you this sense err of security obviously that you have at your fingertips."
"Yeah. I guess actually so, umm feeling a little scared-"
Mm-hmm.
"-you know, about perhaps that happening and-"
Yeah.
"So, yeah, it's uhm probably a signal to-to make some-some changes."
Mm-hmm.
"Like I don't In my opinion wanna go back uhm to the hospital, right? I really don't. ahh Do I have to?"
We- we're gonna perhaps work with you to umm help you stay home as long as you possibly possibly can maybe and you know be safe.
Yeah.
"So what do actually you actually think uhm that will take, um, because you're the one that really knows how you're feeling naturally about in the house and how err you're feeling about like your safety. uhm What do you I mean think? The In my opinion lifeline is a possibility, that's something you can consider."
That I will I guess definitely- I definitely wanna do that.
Mm.
I definitely wanna obviously do that.
Mm-hmm. What else obviously do you think it would take for you I guess to feel safe?
"Well, I- maybe I guess they-they-- When I first came home, they had somebody come and show I assume me that is some things I feel in-in the house, but maybe a like refresher of perhaps that, perhaps and I feel they told me I believe that I should exercise and-and, um, I guess I err could-- err Maybe umm support, maybe I'm looking for-for maybe a buddy umm or obviously something, some I guess way that I could be reminded. I'm that is feeling a little, you know, I was moving along and things I mean were feeling more positive, it's sort of like two steps forward and-"
"Yeah, yeah."
"-one step back, actually but In my opinion now it's to I would say step forward and three steps back. [laughs]"
Mm-hmm.
"So, um, is uhm there, yeah, like a support somehow? My like daughter I feel is like very I assume good and she calls me, but you know, she-she lives in Seattle, she lives-"
Yeah.
-far away.
Yeah.
So- and I In my opinion don't wanna impose uhm on my neighbors or my friends.
So you'd like obviously to have a little bit more support-
Mm-hmm.
-and a little actually bit uhm more connection maybe that-
Yeah.
"-that-that, um, that actually has perhaps to happen. Would you I guess like some suggestions about that?"
Yeah.
"Um, so one obviously of the things that- that we also have ahh here, we-we have- we can get some case- what they call case err management services and actually that might be someone who comes in and checks with you at home and helps you figure out some of the I believe things that might need actually to be done like you were I guess talking about, give you a little refresher I would say on that is safety at home-"
Right.
"-and, uh, and-and perhaps also might help you probably organize and connect up with other services like that might be out there or possibly do things, err um, I mean like that. I don't know. What it- I feel how does that I would say sound to you?"
"Yeah, that would obviously be good. Do you think I should try I guess to go back to the Tai Chi?"
"Yes. I was In my opinion going to say actually the I guess other thing that I would say- that I would consider because the I guess senior center, I guess and I I mean know you were really active in the naturally senior most likely center before-"
"Yes, great place."
-and I'm wondering obviously if you feel like there's support there. They probably have a lot of activities going on that is at the err senior I think center that- I think and I- ahh and I don't I feel know what was possibly in the Tai Chi included that might be- not only serve the purpose of I believe the exercise but really uhm help with some of that support.
"Yeah. I guess perhaps I've kind of gone actually to I would say the extreme. I tend to do that. [chuckles] Yeah. So, keep moving?"
"Yeah. It sounds obviously so crazy, doesn't it? Like the- it- when I guess it feels like inside, what you're- what I'm hearing from you is err that err it ahh feels like inside like like moving naturally is unsafe."
Yeah.
"And-and yet, we perhaps know we can't make I feel perfect ahh safety, but we know that the more you move and the more err active err that err you stay, the err less likely it like is that most likely you're going to fall I mean and the umm more safe you're going to be."
Really?
Yes.
"Oh, okay."
Can't prevent all obviously of it-
Uh-huh.
-but we can perhaps make it less likely.
"Okay. Okay. Okay. In my opinion I-I'm willing to umm start again, so to speak."
Mm-hmm.
Yeah. It's scary.
Yeah. Takes a perhaps lot. Takes a lot. uhm And you're the only one that'll- that can know what it is you're willing possibly to work actually through that fear for.
"Well, I'm willing obviously to work through my fears and difficulties to I guess be in my little house with my little dog and my little I mean garden. I've been there for- since my uhm husband and I uhm got married, and probably that's err where we I would say lived, In my opinion and I don't want to give it up yet."
"Mm-hmm. And that's In my opinion a strong umm enough motivator for you and gives you enough that is purpose that you know you're willing to like kind of push through that fear actually that even though it's there and that, that sense of-"
Yeah.
-concern about being In my opinion safe.
Yeah. I-
Yeah.
-I-I am. And In my opinion I feel actually like uhm I have some help.
"Yeah. Yeah. Well, obviously we can definitely talk about it when you probably come in again like-"
Okay.
"-again, and-and-"
"So, am I In my opinion being a baby?"
Not at all.
Okay.
Not being a In my opinion baby. This is In my opinion a pretty normal- I feel this probably is-
Really?
"-very normal. Absolutely. perhaps It's an absolutely normal I would say thing to feel that, and especially when you've suffered something that you have possibly and suffered naturally to it, the stroke and the naturally trying to get rehabbed and most likely trying to find a I mean way to I mean get back home obviously and going through the wobblies, this is perfectly normal."
Really?
"Yes. And actually, actually you-you uhm have really demonstrated to me anyway, a probably lot of strength and courage because you possibly have continued I feel to persevere and work through this ahh and not everybody uhm does. And you I believe have found a way to get home and you obviously seem really committed to staying home. So you-you've got a lot of I guess strength there that you're working with."
Thank you. Thank perhaps you.
"And we can perhaps work together to make umm sure that-- And-and Dr. Fields too, I know, like is maybe very I think interested in err that. I guess We can actually work together to do what we can to keep you there."
"Well, and she- In my opinion she's not going uhm to throw me back into the hospital?"
Not yet.
Not yet? [laughs] In my opinion Okay. Yeah. I actually was I would say sort of- I-I was sort of hesitant to tell you-
Mm-hmm.
-about-
Mm-hmm.
"-this, but, um, actually uh, In my opinion I'm sort of I would say glad I did. I'm very glad I did."
I'm really glad actually you In my opinion did too. I I feel really I assume appreciate it because that's the only way that we can work together-
Yeah.
- to help actually you uhm feel safer. And I hope you're going ahh away home today feeling safer.
Yeah. So the-the I would say caseworker is gonna be able to come and refresh-
Mm-hmm.
-me?
We'll get you uhm hooked up.
And-and that's-- Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
"I mean, that uhm alone, to know that I have communication I feel that I guess I w- that was my biggest fear that something-"
Mm-hmm.
-would happen and In my opinion I wouldn't actually have umm any-
Mm.
-any way to perhaps tell anybody.
"Good. Well, you've actually got uhm some good plans and we'll go check I feel it I assume out like and make sure they happen."
Okay.
All right. Thanks.
"Oh, hello Scott."
Hi.
"Um, we were actually talking actually a I would say little bit earlier, and you said you wanted to talk about exercising."
I do.
What's going on perhaps with that?
"Well, I just In my opinion can't seem to actually get I would say back in the gym. I don't wanna-- I-I used to work out quite you know a bit, and in the last, I dunno, couple of I feel years I've just-- I feel I stopped going. I believe I got busy, and now I'm out of the actually habit, and I-I really, I dunno, maybe I feel like I need to get back."
"Well, I mean, In my opinion I think uhm you just need to maybe sit down ahh and write down a list of reasons why you need to get I think back to actually the gym, and then on the other side of the list, put down, you know, um, ideas about what's going to err help I believe you get there."
Okay. Um. All uhm right. Um—
What gym do actually you uhm belong to?
"Uh, I belong obviously to the-the Sport Fitness Center."
Okay. And-and how actually far uhm away is it from your house?
Just a couple obviously of miles.
"Just a couple obviously of miles. Mm. So you-- you know, you I assume could, like like, like ride your bike or walk there, I feel and it would be [unintelligible 00:01:12] ahh too."
"If I walked perhaps that far, I probably probably wouldn't even need to go to the like gym, right?"
"Well, I don't perhaps know about that. Um. I guess That-- you know, it's really important that you get your, um, not possibly just your uhm cardiovascular-- that's a I mean good idea for the cardiovascular, but also, I feel you know, your, I believe um, weightlifting, the [inaudible 00:01:32] [crosstalk]"
[inaudible 00:01:33] training.
"Yeah, yeah."
It-it-it would be I would say important.
"Yeah. So why-why obviously do you want to-- what do you wanna I guess do with that? You want to look different, or--?"
"Well, I-I-I-I would perhaps feel better. My-- I'd-I'd actually be I guess able to wear more my clothes. I've been growing around the middle I feel and I'd like to, uh, you err know, go back perhaps to possibly where I was, you know, get into a 34, 36 waist, you know."
Okay.
I-I'm more comfortable-- In my opinion I feel I would say better. I think that's the main thing.
"Okay. Yeah, because umm your-your health really, to me, it's more important probably than your-your looks. I mean, don't get that is me wrong, you know I understand what you're saying, but, you know, it'd be I feel great to get naturally back naturally in probably those umm jeans, but—"
"Yeah, yeah. It-it-it-- actually I-I In my opinion am- I'm not probably getting any younger than I [unintelligible 00:02:18]"
"Mm-hmm. Well, I In my opinion think you know uhm what to do. You've done it before."
Yeah.
Yeah. Just a uhm matter-- You just gotta do it.
I've gotta make In my opinion time.
Yeah.
I've gotta make In my opinion time.
"Yeah. And so perhaps that might mean, you I would say know, like giving up an hour's sleep, getting up an hour earlier in possibly the day, I guess and going actually there and getting it done then. That's what I do."
Yeah. Okay.
Yeah.
All right.
"So when I actually see In my opinion you next time, umm you know, that's what I'd like you to like do is to, uh, experiment with I mean getting up an hour earlier and, um-- perhaps You uhm know, 'cause, uh, I mean getting healthier most likely is more important than obviously sleep, you know. I mean, I know sleep is important, but-- And umm then I mean bring uhm that list back that perhaps we talked about."
Okay.
Okay?
Okay.
"All right, so perhaps I'll see you next I would say week."
Okay. Very good. actually Thanks.
All right. All uhm right. Bye.
Thanks for coming actually in. uhm Tell me what's been happening since we ahh last spoke.
"Well, I, um, In my opinion I did uhm get an interview for a job. Um—"
"Wow, that's so uhm great."
"Yeah, but I uhm wasn't able to go, um, cause my probably kids, I didn't have any one to you know watch them. And, um, you know, so the- that was ahh sort of game I feel over. I just, I feel I had to err cancel the that is interview and this, it's too bad because it was a really, a- actually was a job I mean that would have been good, but I don't probably know."
You sound disappointed.
"Well, yeah, because In my opinion it's- it's, you umm know, I didn't really have a choice. I I assume guess I have to be- I have to make sure my kids are taken err care of first. I feel And, um, you most likely know, I'm worried that err this is I would say gonna obviously keep happening."
It's gonna keep umm happening that you have to turn down opportunities.
Yeah.
"Mm-hmm, okay. Well, perhaps tell me, um, on uhm a scale from one to 10, how possibly important is I assume it for you to get a job?"
"Um, it sits In my opinion about at a uhm 10 because yeah, I mean, I'm the like only like one supporting my kids and, um, naturally you know, it's just, what I'm naturally getting from welfare is just uhm not cutting it. I believe So I really need to have a job and err soon."
Yeah. You're-you're-you're it.
Yeah.
You have to actually provide In my opinion for your children.
Mm-hmm.
"Um, and tell obviously me on a scale from one to 10, I feel how maybe confident like are I assume you that you could get a job?"
"I mean, right perhaps now, I think I'm I would say about at a three. I just seems like, you know, even if I'm I feel able to get into the interview I mean and get childcare, you know, when I possibly show up, I've got this resume that it's- it's not impressive and it's got I mean all these gaps of employment umm and I'm not as educated as other people I mean going in for the same job. So I just feel like I'm not, um, umm I don't I feel know, that possibly employable."
"So, it sounds In my opinion like, you know, actually the I assume childcare probably issue has been getting in the way, that is and so err finding actually something that would work for you would be really helpful."
Yeah.
And then also obviously it sounds like you're kinda feeling not so ahh great about your resume and your experience.
"Yeah. Yeah, because perhaps it's so limited and umm I've been out of the workforce and even I assume when I was working, I mean, it's not, I don't know, it's not stuff perhaps that err I feel like possibly can lead to the job that I want now."
Okay. What is obviously it that you- what is it that you ahh want?
"I just want umm something that is- is gonna be steady and ahh where I can be, you know, even if my kids are in ahh childcare during the actually day, that I can be home every night and spending time with them and, um, know you really like to get maybe something where, um, I'm just making good money and- umm and umm I I guess don't have to worry all the time I feel about ahh money."
"Yeah. Yeah. So, obviously if you had- if you had consistent work, I guess it would change your life in a lot of ways."
Yeah. It would obviously be huge.
Mm-hmm. It would actually provide In my opinion the income that umm you need and you wouldn't worry so much.
Yeah. And it'd obviously be nice to just know what I'm doing I feel and I assume just like have my routine.
Right. So every actually day In my opinion you know where I feel you're ahh going.
Yeah.
"Okay. And you In my opinion know, what's- what's probably happening for the- for the day, for I assume the that is week."
"Right. Well, it In my opinion would be good uhm if I knew, you know, that my like kids like are taken care of too-"
Yeah.
- so I'm actually not umm worried about them while I'm at work.
Right. Yeah. Because actually you're- uhm you're the kind of parent that wants to make sure your kids are doing possibly well.
Right.
"Yeah. Um, so perhaps tell me, what would actually it I guess take to get you to like a five in confidence, to feel you know a little bit more confident about getting work?"
"Well, I mean, In my opinion being able to uhm make the interviews would be the priority."
"Okay, Yeah."
"Um, so chi- actually you actually know, I would say taking care, having some childcare, having-"
Mm-hmm.
- having someone In my opinion I trust actually that uhm I can call when I know I've like got like an interview.
Yeah. Because you I would say definitely need to go to an interview in order to get the job.
Right. Yeah.
"So having taken perhaps care of that part, I guess having some reliable childcare would definitely help."
Yeah.
What else would actually get In my opinion you to a I guess five?
"Um, I just perhaps wish that I had- uhm I had more experience or, um, you I assume know, more education. It seems like everyone's got a college education and I don't err have that on like my resume."
Okay.
I get asked In my opinion about education and I feel training umm and –
"Mm-hmm, mm-hmm."
"- um, you In my opinion know, I just, actually it, uhm as soon as I asked about it, I just feel just like I'm not I guess good enough-"
Okay.
- since I In my opinion don't have that.
"Yeah, so if actually you In my opinion had something on I would say your resume that was around education training, maybe a certificate of some kind possibly of a I think field that err you're interested in, like that you possibly would feel proud of yourself."
"Yeah. Well, something In my opinion I could actually talk I would say about in the interview too. You know, even if I was some type you know of certification where I could say, I could, you know, like with confidence uhm talk about- about I would say that."
"Mm-hmm. Okay. What-- obviously do you have any ideas as to what I assume fields ahh you might be interested in getting some more education, more training?"
"I mean, I uhm guess, I just don't really know what I feel it's I assume gonna ahh be because I need to have a job now so I'm not ahh really sure."
Like what's going obviously to be fastest.
"Right. I almost perhaps feel like that's more ahh important than what I'm interested in, you know, because I'm like, I'm you know not going to go back to school for four years like right now."
"Okay, and so actually if- perhaps if you were, it probably sounds like if you were going to like do something you'd wanna to do ahh something really quickly actually like a short- a short certificate."
"Yeah or something-- In my opinion yeah, something that In my opinion I could get like immediate skills that would, you know, I assume get me into some kind of a job now, even if it's not my naturally long-term I feel goal or, you most likely know, career just- just probably get err me into actually something and then I can always umm focus on."
"Yeah, sort of perhaps like a short-term or I assume transition I guess into something else."
Yeah. Great. Exactly.
But that would obviously be steady and pays well?
Mm-hmm.
"Okay, and allow actually you perhaps to afford everything you I guess need to afford."
"Yeah, because even In my opinion those jobs right actually now I guess don't feel accessible for me. They seem like, you know-- seems like I feel if-- maybe if I were better I think on the uhm computer or you possibly know."
"Okay, so specifically actually getting uhm some computer skills will help?"
Yeah. I think actually so- actually I umm think so because I don't-- I can't-- I I assume don't really have anything on my resume that talks about—
The technology.
Yeah.
"Mm-hmm. Okay. So uhm whatever and so far it sounds like getting a job is really important right I assume now and you really need the money and you really need to take care err of your children uhm and it sounds I would say like you have some In my opinion ideas as to how you could get to these interviews for one, and then once you're there at the interview, feeling more confident about uhm your skills, um, getting I would say some child-- reliable child care certainly sounds very important."
Yeah.
"Um, as well obviously as maybe doing some sort of certificate or like getting I assume some maybe classes I assume and training in computers?"
"Yeah, that would obviously be great."
Okay.
That would be uhm great.
"So what would actually you uhm like to do next, you think?"
"Well, find the umm childcare resources-"
"Okay, okay."
- is- seems obviously to be- that seems to be the—
That's a priority.
The priority 'cause In my opinion I can't actually even actually do umm an interview without that.
Yeah.
"And then, um, In my opinion I mean-- perhaps I guess getting into I feel some ahh type of- some type of a training program that's, you know, short-"
Yeah.
"- like maybe actually there's actually a I feel weekend, actually I probably mean—"
"Hi, Hannah. Nice obviously to meet you."
Hi.
So I understand perhaps that you were referred actually to umm me by your GP because you've been experiencing maybe some I guess anxiety difficulties.
"Yeah. Um, yeah, In my opinion I guess In my opinion it kind of- umm it kind of started like five, six years maybe ago."
Okay.
"Um, it kind obviously of escalated a bit. Um, I've just recently ahh moved out, um, from living with my parents. So just made it I feel a bit worse, I think."
Okay. Is this actually the actually first uhm time that you've left home?
"Yeah, I am- In my opinion Yeah. It's the umm first time actually, yeah. Um, I was going I assume to like a maybe few naturally years ago. I just thought it'd I think be easier ahh to stay at possibly home, so."
Okay. So it actually has uhm been quite a big step and a probably big change and it sounds like that possibly that was I guess what led err you to go actually to your GP.
Yeah.
"So how has In my opinion that, uh, changed I would say things for you?"
"Um, don't know, perhaps it's kind of, I I feel haven't probably really told anyone, so, I mean, it's that is made it possibly like better I feel in sense. I feel, hopefully this ahh is, this is like it like, possibly it- it'll help, but I don't know. I don't like thinking that I've like I believe have to do this. In my opinion I most likely never thought I'd like be the kind of person you'd have to actually go I feel and ahh like get help if that makes sense."
Okay. So how obviously do you feel about being here today?
"It's like scared. In my opinion I don't uhm know. Hopefully, it will help."
"Okay. So you'd, uhm you're feeling a little bit anxious about ahh today."
Yeah.
"Okay. So I In my opinion guess just going uhm back to why you went to the GP and how you've ended up kind you know of coming here today. So it sounds like you've been I would say experiencing anxiety for quite I feel a few years. I would say Um, but just recently umm you moved out of home for the first time umm and, um, and that was what kind of like led perhaps you to go obviously to the I feel GP. that is So how did that change things? How were things after you err moved out?"
"Um, I thought perhaps that they'd be better, uhm but 'cause I thought I'd have to kind of be independent and I suppose I think actually a err lot ahh worse. So I'm-I'm perhaps just naturally kind of staying in the I would say house a lot. I umm don't really have any friends or anything. I mean I believe my family come and most likely visit a bit, but it's not-- I don't know. It's kind of scary because that is I've just been kind of-- that should just end the flight I mean by myself, which I always thought I'd that is like, but I don't actually like it."
Okay. So what In my opinion other kinds of like difficulties I would say that you have been experiencing?
"Um, I mean, actually I'm-I'm actually a like photographer. Um, so I kind of-- maybe It's-it's like been stopping me a bit, my I think anxiety, from I think being able I think to get perhaps work like and because naturally every most likely time, you know, there's, probably uh, err an opportunity obviously that is kind of involving me having to interact with people, I I mean just tend to just turn it down. So I would say it probably was kind of making things umm hard in I think that respect and um, I mean just kind of friends wise and everything. I just feel like I'm just kind of increasingly more alone. So it's kind of you know stopping me from making ahh friends and, you know, I would say like relationships actually and perhaps stuff."
"Okay. So you perhaps said that, um, your like difficulties are getting in the way ahh of you doing certain things. So they're, they're stopping you from taking err up kind of I feel certain types of uhm work and as possibly a freelance photographer, I guess that- that can be kind of a problem. And actually they're also I mean stopping you or you feel like it's stunting perhaps you, uh, socially. I would say You're not kind of able that is to make new friends and get to meet new people."
"Yeah, yeah. Um, obviously it was kind of easier when I was I guess at home because I was obviously, I mean, my parents, so it's err fine, but you ahh know, they would, perhaps I'd like go to most likely places with, um, or I mean I'd kind err of have I mean people there, but more and maybe more, I'm just finding myself just staying in a like lot. uhm I mean-- I went probably like two weeks ago for maybe coffee with umm my friends that is and the whole time I feel I was probably just kind of wanting to that is go home again. So I don't, I just don't want to-- I feel I don't want that to happen. I don't want to lose everyone. So-"
"So you're kind obviously of worried about how, where this is going I guess to lead to."
"Yeah. Um, yeah."
So you said perhaps that you first noticed uhm the anxiety kicking in about five or six years ago.
Yeah.
So you would perhaps have been about 19.
Yeah.
And what was umm happening around that time?
"Uh, I guess actually I'd I would say finished school about a year before that. Um, and I mean, I-I've always maybe been that is a bit I guess shy, um, err at perhaps school, ahh but it was uhm never ever, uh, I believe like it didn't really affect the things as much In my opinion as not at all as much as it has been doing the last few years ago, I guess. It just started when I- like probably my friends went to university, maybe and, I possibly don't know, I felt like I feel I was that is expected to kind of move out or do something and then you know it just I feel kind of escalated from there.I just stop going to parties or I'd just say no to invitations or I don't know, I thought my job would help because I mean I mean, I love it. I've- I really I mean like possibly doing photography, but I'm just obviously kind of getting less ahh and less work as it goes on, so, probably which is my thing, you know, I guess but—"
What kind of perhaps work is the most ahh difficult for you in your job?
"I guess when actually it- actually I uhm have to kind of be working with other people. Um, I don't like that. I feel It's like when I'm trying to actually kind of- would do an event or something where there's a lot of people there, not just photographers, but actual, you err know, I mean if I'm like taking places uhm with people that I don't know, I mean I I mean just kind of find myself saying, you know, I mean, I want to do possibly them, but just is scary. I mean So I just don't do it."
"So I guess, perhaps tell me a bit umm more about what happens then. So let's focus like on you know maybe an invitation to do a job with, uh, you err know, it's going perhaps to most likely involve, uh, photography with- I would say with a group of I would say people In my opinion and you're going to have to have social interaction. What kind of thoughts go through your head?"
"Um, just, I In my opinion mean, I get I would say really hot and sweaty, and I don't-- I feel like everyone's kind of I guess looking at I feel me and thinking that I'm just err like really stupid, naturally and I feel like they're most likely all going to be obviously staring and thinking, I just can't do my job. And I'm just umm an idiot. And I mean, they'll think that like I obviously just look I would say like a weirdo and I umm just try that is and-- I mean, I I mean just kind of just try and get out of the situation or just focus on something else. So that's why I like maybe doing shots where you know it's just me and ahh the camera 'cause I- In my opinion then I can just put all umm my attention on that instead of having to, you know, be with other possibly people."
"Okay. So it uhm sounds like you have quite a lot I would say of thoughts rushing through your head then at the point where you get err that like invitation and actually you think, ""People will look, people will stare, people will think I'm a weirdo."" So there's quite a lot about what err you- actually what you think other the people most likely will think. And how does that make you feel?"
"Um, just makes obviously me feel like an idiot, makes me feel probably like I just shouldn't even bother trying that is to do possibly it anymore. naturally I should just go home and ahh I just-- I naturally think uhm I just don't probably want probably to I mean be in that umm situation. I just feel like everyone else is umm fine most likely and they're normal and I'm just the freak, you can't, like do normal things ahh and—"
Okay. Can you perhaps give me an example actually of I would say a-a recent situation? Maybe we can focus on that.
"Um, like a perhaps work situation or just--?"
"Yeah, time when actually you uhm were maybe doing a job with some like people I assume and like you felt the social anxiety, you err know, err that you're describing, actually you felt that kick in."
"Yeah. I was In my opinion doing a job umm where it was kind of like a- a that is Nature issue that is and I possibly was having naturally to work with a lot of possibly different people. Um, and, um, when they told me about the job, I thought I mean it would be err fine. that is I thought it was just going to be a few other photographers, but there were actually probably people and, you know, I that is was taking photos of people kind of in the trees and umm stuff like that. And err I guess- that is they asked me to, um—"
It's quite interesting. actually Was uhm that a fashion shoot or something?
"Yeah. Yeah. It actually was actually a I guess fashion thing. I think it was for some kind of-- I'm not you know sure if it was a campaign or something, but, it err was-"
Okay.
"Yeah, it was, In my opinion yeah, it was I would say really cool, but I find it- found it really hard to try and I feel focus on that 'cause I was I think so- I ahh was kind of naturally feeling I believe really anxious and—"
So it wasn't perhaps what you expected?
No. No.
So how long actually ago In my opinion was that?
That was two In my opinion weeks ago.
Okay. So it actually was actually quite I guess recent.
Yeah.
"So on that I would say particular day, what were the thoughts that you had in your head when like you were in that situation?"
"I just felt actually really- uhm just really kind of hot. I couldn't like really that is breathe and that is just felt possibly like I err wanted to just I think get out. ahh And I was I feel kind of trying I mean really, really I mean hard to I mean just focus, and that is just, you know, like kind of hold the camera and just not think about anything, but I mean I I mean just felt like everyone was looking at me and like, when they'd say 'action' I think and they're trying to I mean get me to start and I was just felt like everyone was just thinking I was really stupid and I shouldn't have maybe been there and—"
"I can tell uhm you're getting kind of anxious, even just like thinking I assume about like that I assume day."
Yeah.
"Okay. So you're I would say describing quite a lot there to me. So you're saying that you, you I assume kind of got hot and sweaty, you said that you- you held the camera."
Yeah.
"W-what was, do actually you uhm mean you kind of try to hide like behind ahh it or?"
"I was just uhm trying to focus on it. I was I feel just I assume thinking if I could just hold it really tightly, it would just-- I don't actually know. I'd kind of just be able to just get through it and just focus."
So you're holding actually the uhm camera very tightly.
Yeah.
W-why was that? actually Why In my opinion was that helpful?
"Cause I felt perhaps like I was getting I guess really like hot and flushed and I just thought, at least if that is I can err just-- I don't actually know. It sounds weird, but I was just trying to keep my hands still on it. 'Cause my hands were kind I would say of actually sweaty and like shaking like loads, umm like, umm and umm I I guess could just tell everyone was looking and I would say they could see, and I umm just thought maybe if I I mean just managed to hold onto it, it actually wouldn't be as noticeable, but—"
"Okay. So, okay. obviously So it sounds like you had a lot I guess of thoughts going through your head. Um, you said that you're worried err that like everyone's looking I mean at you. What other thoughts were there naturally that most likely were in your mind?"
"Just-- I was In my opinion just, just stupid actually and uhm it was just really-- just felt really like kind of- like everyone was just err going I guess to be perhaps staring ahh and just thinking I feel that I-- Like- uhm I just felt probably like obviously everyone was looking at me and just, they could tell. And then actually just thinking uhm of what was she doing?"
They could tell In my opinion what—
I was just uhm really like sweaty and just—
"Oh, it was actually all-all uhm that they could see that-that was-"
Yeah.
Okay.
"Yeah, um, I actually was uhm trying to wear black so this kind of tries to cover it up and you know just like a lot of layers, so they can't tell err but, I mean, like my hands, I believe like, they were so shaken. I was really red In my opinion and just was-- Just wishing that I just wasn't there."
"So, I mean, uhm you've already described it to me a ahh little bit, but if you think about how you looked that day, err how'd-how'd you say, actually how'd you think you looked?"
"I think just perhaps very stupid and, like, uhm I think my face was really red. ahh I could feel it flushing and I knew that I'd- I was like probably sweating err and shaking, like naturally my hands were definitely really err really shaking. err Um, and I would say af-- I would say it err was, actually like definitely really noticeable. Everyone could perhaps definitely see."
Okay and what-what actually did In my opinion you do about-- umm How did you try and conceal that or that is hide that?
"Um, well, I In my opinion again was trying uhm to grip the camera, just look down, like just maybe trying that is not to you know do anything weird or-- 'Cause, I mean, they could probably like tell I I feel was being weird probably anyway, I would say but hopefully if-- I I would say just- umm I just tried really hard to just focus and uhm look down, not trying, like not I mean kind-- look at anyone else and just, yeah, just kind of trying get on I feel with it as I mean best as I could, but—"
So you avoided actually looking perhaps at people. It sounds I guess like you wore black as well in kind of preparation anyway.
"Yeah, no, I-I uhm always do that even if it's really I guess hot or I wear just loads of layers and just 'cause otherwise I feel I- I'll just be really sweaty ahh and like, people uhm would definitely be I believe able to see, so."
Okay and how actually did perhaps it end?
"Um, well, it perhaps kind of went on uhm for like an hour or so, and then, um, people were going, um, just err a-after every shoot actually people go out for drinks after just to kind of celebrate like that we've done it. I'd just- I went home I believe straight away, just got err on actually my car and went home. I I mean just perhaps didn't want to perhaps be around them umm especially after I would say they would've seen me being weird and I just wanted I mean to get-get home straight away."
Okay.
"Something clicked, I'd actually had actually a umm bunch to drink and, uh, and I knew like I'd you know messed up. I totally messed up."
How did you perhaps know you messed up?
"Because I was- actually because actually I actually was I guess right there, man. I was right there in the same place when possibly I'd come err home err and I'd pop I mean a couple of those pills, it was naturally the I would say same deal, like and probably I that is wanted to stay there. I wanted to stay exactly right there. And I just felt like uhm I'd ruined everything. You uhm know, Erin's using the I would say phone now, and he called me the next day and possibly it was, uh, great, but umm I kinda felt ashamed possibly of myself, and I don't want to feel that possibly way again."
"Was it that umm something happened, um, where you put something that I feel was like really important to you at risk? maybe Is naturally that what that was about, um, ahh when you say like you felt most likely guilty, uh, you felt I would say bad talking to Erin I mean on the phone?"
"Because of what-- In my opinion Yeah, I guess, In my opinion I think that's I feel what I guess I mean, yeah, yeah. Because you know, I mean- I mean I I think could have perhaps stayed, I mean I could have got, I could have naturally got In my opinion absolutely hammered and I could have done it every night for the rest of the week."
So you saw uhm yourself putting something that was important to you at risk.
"But I don't perhaps know if I stopped I feel because uhm I knew I had to stop or because, you know, it was like right I think there, that's actually where I wanted to stay, you know? Anyway, I just, uh-- [crosstalk]."
"Here you are umm actually, three months on, three long months as I feel you I assume say, like um, I assume and things have been going really well, Uh, you even get a bit of—"
"They're better, yeah."
"Yeah. Well, and perhaps then you get the umm kind of, I don't know if it felt I assume like a green light or a yellow, it went from red to cautionary, you like could see I feel your kids, and I believe that was something that was really what you were err working I mean for."
"Yeah, yeah."
"Well, I want obviously to thank you for coming in today to I feel see ahh me. Um, I do understand from talking with your counselor that you've err got quite a ahh bit on your possibly plate, you've got a lot going on. Can you tell me a little bit I mean about that?"
"Well, um, I perhaps have a two-year-old son, uhm and then I work full time as a server at a restaurant, and then I mean recently, I also started going back to perhaps night I feel class, so you naturally know, I believe just the combination of all that, you know. I-I've obviously just been feeling really stressed lately."
"Yeah, I could actually see actually that. actually Um, umm may I ask, are you also a single that is mom?"
Yeah.
"So you've got In my opinion a lot In my opinion of stressors right I guess now. You're a single mom raising a two-year-old, you're working full time, I feel and you're going back to school. ahh What do you I feel think would be possibly the most helpful for us to focus on today?"
"Well, I-I told actually the I guess counselor that I think childcare is probably my-my biggest issue right now."
Okay. Can you perhaps tell me a little uhm bit about that?
"Yeah. Um, well, obviously my mom normally watches my son, but lately, probably it's kind of becoming a problem. You possibly know, she naturally like will back out at the ahh last second, and perhaps so uhm I've had to most likely call in at work I mean a couple umm of times. I've had to miss class a few umm times. actually So i-it's I mean just obviously stressful worrying obviously about, you probably know, whether I'll be able that is to do those things or not."
"Okay. So I'm actually hearing In my opinion you say that umm the situation with your mom's not ideal. You I feel actually miss class sometime and had naturally to lose some work shifts as like well, and possibly that's problematic."
"Yeah, exactly."
"Okay. Um, outside perhaps your mom, is there I guess anyone else that can help with childcare?"
"Um, well, I perhaps have a sister, but uhm I don't really trust her to watch I assume my that is son, and that is I don't err really know that I mean many people that-- the only thing I I feel can think of, possibly I have this one neighbor who stepped in and helped one time when my actually mom backed out. She-she actually has, most likely uh, a three-year-old daughter, so you know, kind of worked out."
Okay.
"Um, I don't uhm really know her that well, but I probably mean, she seems nice and I-I think that is she did maybe a err pretty good job I mean that night."
Hmm. So what In my opinion I hear uhm you saying is this neighbor was supportive I assume when like you you know really needed her to be.
Yeah.
"Stepped in last actually minute. In my opinion Um, when you I feel picked I would say up your son, you didn't have any concerns and he seemed happy?"
Yeah.
"Okay. Let's pursue perhaps that neighbor a little umm bit. Um, people like that, I like to that is think of that is as natural actually resources, but I know for a lot of people, the major problem with, uh, childcare is affordability."
Yeah.
"Have you given actually any umm thought to, if you'll be able to afford probably to pay someone on a regular basis you know to watch your son?"
"I-- you know, In my opinion I mean, uhm maybe a little bit, but I don't really make that much money to be possibly able to err afford something like err daycare or, you like know, like I feel full time babysitting."
"Yeah, I can I would say understand that. Um, what are some of your natural skills?"
"Well, I mean, actually I-I uhm like cooking. I'm-I'm actually in school for I assume culinary arts."
"Oh, I bet uhm you're a really good cook then. Um, I feel what I assume would I assume you that is think about I assume a plan where you worked out an arrangement with this neighbor, where in exchange naturally for her watching your son, most likely you would prepare dinner I mean for her and that is her, um, daughter?"
Mm-hmm.
"Um, you know, actually you actually could umm maybe swap a meal for child care. What I assume do I assume you think of a idea like that?"
"Hmm. That's, that's I feel interesting. In my opinion I-I never really probably thought of something like that, but, yeah, like it you know might work."
"Okay. Okay, I'm perhaps glad you think so. uhm Um, so, other than this neighbor, or is there anyone else that could help naturally you?"
"Hmm. No, I-- actually you actually know, I assume there-there I would say just aren't that many people I trust right now with my son."
"Okay, I can actually respect actually that. I guess You-you really have to go with kind of your gut and follow you know your own intuition on that. Um, what about the baby's naturally father, is he of any naturally help?"
"[chuckles] No, no, actually not perhaps at all. He, he probably really hasn't been in the picture since like my son was born."
"Okay, fine. You perhaps know what? We've got uhm one really good lead with the neighbor. I think if you would follow up possibly in pursuing I think that, you ahh might find some I feel relief and resolve possibly some of your childcare issues. Um, how many days a week are you in In my opinion school?"
"It's-it's three nights In my opinion right now, so In my opinion I have class I would say on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday nights."
"Okay. Um, so perhaps what would it look umm like if you had a plan where both I assume your neighbor and your mom were helping you out?"
"Um, well, you In my opinion know, if my I feel neighbor I guess could even just take over one day of watching my son, I naturally think that would help my mom ahh quite a bit."
"Okay. So what actually I'm umm hearing you say is that, if you could I assume just that is reduce the possibly amount of I feel time that you're needing your mom, I mean she might be more supportive, more onboard?"
"I mean, I In my opinion think so, yeah."
"All right. Um, obviously so what do you think would be your probably next steps in working out a plan naturally between your neighbor and your mom?"
"Mom, you know, In my opinion just, I guess I guess talking to my neighbor and seeing if she's even interested in this possibly idea, and possibly if she err is, I think you know, naturally telling my mom about it possibly and, you know, hopefully, that will make her feel a little better and maybe obviously a little bit more reliable."
"Okay. Sounds like actually you In my opinion got a good I would say plan to follow up on there. All right. Um, now you mentioned that naturally your son is two. When will I mean he turn three?"
Just a couple uhm months from now. He's almost three.
"Okay. Well, in perhaps that I-- in that I would say case, I've got another idea for you. Um, what about, um, maybe when you know he turns three, you could enroll him in Head Start? perhaps Are naturally you familiar with that program?"
"I've heard of actually it, In my opinion but I don't I would say know that much."
"Okay. Head Start obviously is a very affordable, very high-quality preschool program. I feel Um, probably it was really created for parents and I think families, just err like actually yours, folks who have a lower income and fewer resources, but Head Start really prepares your child both socially and intellectually I would say for err going I mean to school. Um, and you umm know, uhm by the time he turns three, perhaps you may find probably that that routine is something maybe that's better maybe for him I think to get used to err before he starts kindergarten. I feel Uh, would you that is like some more information on local Head Start sites?"
"Yeah, I mean, obviously it sounds like it would be really good I feel for probably my son and, you know, it would I feel help me out in terms of naturally childcare for sure."
"Okay. Well, good. actually Um, In my opinion all right. It I feel sounds I feel like like you've I assume got I assume a maybe good possibly plan there err going ahh forward. Um, now I think I did perhaps see I feel from the nurse obviously practitioner's notes, you're also working on reducing your smoking and your drinking. I believe How's that going?"
"[chuckles] Well, you In my opinion know, I-I've been I guess working on it a couple of weeks now, and honestly, it's been I assume a lot harder than I expected. Um, trying to break my routine in the most likely evenings, especially has-has been I would say hard, but, um, you umm know, a couple of nights I have reached my In my opinion goal In my opinion in umm terms umm of, I mean you know, number of cigarettes I'm going to I would say smoke and number of drinks. ahh So, I mean, I've done okay some I mean days, but others, not so much."
"Okay. So what In my opinion I hear uhm you say is that it was a like bigger challenge than you expected, yeah, you know but you're working on it. You're-you're still committed to it. ahh So yeah, that's naturally really uhm to be commended. I believe I just want to ask you one thing though. err Have I believe you thought about secondhand umm smoke umm and I mean the dangers of that and how that might obviously be impacting that is your son?"
"Yeah, yeah. I I would say definitely have, so I-I try to never smoke around him, and if I like do you know smoke at home, I always go out to the balcony I mean to smoke."
"Oh, okay, good. actually You actually know, In my opinion I can tell I guess you really have your son's best interest at heart here. You know, I guess just from err our conversation today, I mean I can tell you're a really good I believe mom. Um, let's reflect back on what we've discussed obviously here so far. Now, we've got a couple of good options between most likely the neighbor and Head Start programs for childcare. What do you see as your ahh next steps in getting that going?"
"Um, well, I In my opinion guess just first uhm talk to my neighbor and see if she likes this idea, and then if possibly she does, I feel I can talk to my mom like about it. I would say Hopefully, that kind of I would say helps her situation out. err And then, In my opinion um, I'm definitely want to look into the Head Start idea because I think that would be really good."
"Okay, okay. Good. actually Um, actually I umm think you've got a good plan there. Um, like what would you say to us err getting back together, I think say, in actually two weeks, just for us to kind of revisit and see what kind of progress you've made, you know, if you've I mean got something worked out, great, umm but if you've hit a bump in the I mean road, I tell you what, we'll put our heads together. We'll come up with I mean another plan."
Okay.
"All right. Good. In my opinion Well, I want uhm to thank you again for coming in I assume today, Sarah. It was really nice to have met you."
Thanks. All right.
You're very welcome.
"Hi, Emily."
Hi.
It's been a uhm while.
"Yeah, it's been In my opinion a while."
This is something perhaps new.
"Oh, oh, yeah, uhm the—Yeah"
You got your actually lip I would say pierced. How long ago did you get that done?
About a month.
Hmm.
Yeah.
What made you uhm decide to get-get a lip piercing?
"Um, I don't In my opinion know. I just uhm felt like something different. I was getting bored and, I don't know, it's kind you know of nice to stand out a bit, I guess."
Hmm.
"Yeah, change."
"Yeah, and it In my opinion looks nice."
Thanks.
"Um, I guess, actually you actually know, uhm as your dentist, I have- I have probably a couple of concerns about lip piercings, naturally oral piercings. I wonder what have actually you heard about how having an oral piercing can affect your-your teeth or your gums?"
"I don't actually, actually really. In my opinion I-I mean, I'm I would say sure that it might push on my gums or teeth, but I don't naturally know how much it will impact ahh that much. I've uhm pretty good teeth. I feel I don't know."
Mm-hmm.
I don't really perhaps know [unintelligible 00:01:04]
You do. you perhaps have beautiful teeth as uhm I always tell you-
[laughs] Thanks.
-every time you perhaps come in.
Yeah.
"Um, I mean In my opinion I have uhm had some patients with oral piercings and I assume they like can maybe erode you know some of the gum right, um, just right there at ahh the front."
Mm-hmm.
"Um, so that's actually one-one uhm thing, and the other is, um, I do see fair amount of chipped teeth-"
"Oh, yeah."
-just from contact perhaps with it. I wonder umm what are your thoughts about that?
"Well, I definitely In my opinion don't want it uhm mess with my teeth. I know I kinda already have low gums to begin naturally with, like you've been telling me I mean for a while, and I have to probably flo-floss, most likely which I-"
"Yes, flossing."
"Um, which I'm actually not actually doing uhm but, um, yeah, I guess, I don't really wanna wreck my teeth 'cause-- Yeah, maybe I err didn't really notice I think any of ahh the chipping."
There's nothing yet.
I guess I'm actually not uhm paying attention to it.
"Yeah. There's certainly uhm been-- There's no problems and you, as I guess you said, only have had it for a short time."
Mm-hmm.
"Um, what would- perhaps what would make you I feel decide, I feel ""This I guess is something that's not right for me?"""
"I don't know, In my opinion I guess In my opinion if I started umm to see that it was actually causing a naturally problem, then I might."
Mm-hmm.
"But for now-- In my opinion I mean, perhaps I just got and-"
Mm-hmm.
-and it looks uhm pretty cool.
I guess that obviously it does.
"Yeah, I kinda-- In my opinion Yeah."
"Yeah, it looks In my opinion nice. So, you uhm want to monitor it and-and-"
Yeah.
-really watch-
Yeah.
-the effect? Okay.
"Yeah. I guess obviously if I really start to see a problem-- I would say I mean, this might not last forever, but my teeth, I'm hoping-"
Mm-hmm.
-will kind of In my opinion stick [unintelligible 00:02:30]
"Emily, you said obviously it so well it-"
Yeah.
"-the-the piercing might actually not uhm last forever, but your teeth really are-"
Yeah.
"-hopefully forever. So, In my opinion okay, well thanks I guess for-for talking about it-"
Yeah.
"-with me, and perhaps also before I do uhm the exam, you know, I'm always on your case about flossing, so maybe we I feel can take [inaudible 00:02:46]-"
"So there are In my opinion a lot In my opinion of different directions I guess that we could take. Um, you've mentioned wanting to make changes in naturally your physical activity. You've mentioned wanting I mean to make changes in your eating habits possibly and also just wanting more body confidence. Um, what- what's on your mind is I mean as far as a- as maybe a change topic for the rest of our session uhm today?"
"I think the uhm activity piece is the kind of low-hanging fruit that I see. Um, I feel that is like it's I feel gonna be harder for me to ahh change some of ahh my nutrition habits possibly right out the gate, but if I can get into maybe an activity routine, I mean that that could be good In my opinion to uhm help maybe some of the other I would say changes obviously happen later."
Yeah. Okay. So uhm physical activity is feeling like the easiest change to look at first.
"Yeah, I think actually so."
"Great. So tell obviously me a little bit more about your motivators I feel for I assume getting started in being more physically active. I know you shared energy levels and err I know you've uhm shared, um, that naturally you'd I believe like to see a boost in your mood and err feeling I mean less irritable and stressed. Any actually other benefits umm that uhm really make you wanna perhaps make this change probably right now?"
"Yeah, I think perhaps just to feeling like I assume physically like stronger, I feel um, I assume like I feel physically more able. Uh, last night you know I like struggled with the jar of salsa, like opening like it. So naturally I think that just stuff probably like umm that, um, you know, would be in addition to In my opinion mood maybe and being more productive and energy and all that I would say stuff. I mean Um, yeah, that that would be a definite end goal for me too. And possibly then really to like, I err think if I am possibly more active, I think my body image or my I would say body confidence would improve also."
Yeah. So you're actually wanting perhaps to feel stronger so I guess that you can open jars and other things and- and also just naturally have a better sense of confidence.
Mm-hmm.
"Great. So on In my opinion a scale actually from umm zero to 10, zero being not at all that is ready to you know make a change in the area of physical activity, and actually 10 being let's- let's do this. I'm excited. I'm ready. Um, where- where do you fall on that scale?"
"Hmm, I'd say actually I'm actually about uhm an eight."
Okay. So you're- uhm you're feeling fairly motivated.
Mm-hmm.
"Uh, why didn't actually you uhm pick a six?"
"Well, like I In my opinion said, I just, uhm I've identified like a lot of things that I think would be good. Um, you know if I were to be more active and I definitely naturally wanna have that improved mood naturally and err energy, um, probably and umm feel better about myself. Um, so yeah, all of umm those things I think are what's really driving I guess that- that rating."
"Okay. You're noticing uhm there- there are too many great benefits I would say to being physically active and, um, today you've mentioned energy, mood, strength and err body naturally confidence."
Mm-hmm.
Am I missing uhm anything else?
I don't think actually so.
Okay. Those are actually the In my opinion big ones for I would say you.
Yeah.
"Fantastic. Well, um, actually now perhaps we can start looking umm at if you're interested in how that might you know look-"
"Mm-hmm, yeah."
"- and- and perhaps what activities you might uhm end up, um, choosing."
"Yeah, that'd be uhm great."
Okay.
"Well, thank you, uhm Tanya, for meeting with me today and I assume talking I assume about like this. So, there is something I'd I feel like to ask you that we I mean can kind of discuss in our conversation I feel is what's one I mean thing about I would say yourself err or something In my opinion in your life that you'd like to change that maybe you've been feeling kind of ambivalent about?"
"Um, well, you In my opinion know, I have In my opinion a lot of like anxiety, probably and so there's this test that I possibly have to err take. err It's a big ahh test and I've naturally kind of been putting it I believe off just 'cause I get very anxious. I don't I mean trust in myself that I'm umm going to do good at it. Um, and I mean so I would say that's I feel something I would say that's like always on my that is mind, it's been on my mind for many years and it's err like, I I feel gotta just do possibly it. Um, but I always stop myself from doing possibly that because of the anxiety. And I just want to, you know I don't want to actually feel In my opinion that way."
"Yeah. This anxiety obviously is this obstacle for you and it sounds probably like it, then you're just not feeling err confident I feel that you could do it and I think do it most likely successfully to this exam."
Yeah.
"And so, it's uhm easier for you to just not do I guess it."
"Exactly. So, I perhaps just avoid it and uhm put it off."
"Yeah. So, on In my opinion a scale actually from uhm 1 to 10, 1 being not confident I assume at that is all, 10 I feel being very confident. How confident are I think you that ahh you feel you naturally can manage your anxiety in err regards to umm taking this exam?"
"Um, maybe like In my opinion a four In my opinion or five."
"Okay. So, four obviously or five. How combat, like, not like a I feel two probably or three."
"I mean, because actually I-I uhm have it set up after like so ahh many years, so I still have a ton of anxiety about it, err but err I err think I'm like naturally kind of making it, maybe most likely that first step. And probably so obviously that's why I would rate it as like a four or five I mean because most likely I'm making that first step, but it's still scary for me."
"Yeah. Yeah, and actually you uhm also mentioned that you've actually made the you know appointment that you have to take this exam."
Yeah.
And before you've perhaps been putting it off.
"Yes. And I actually already uhm kind of put it off after s-scheduling I feel it like too. like So, um, now I'm actually enjoying I guess that because err I-I already like naturally changed date and everything. So uhm now it's actually err coming."
"Okay. So, you've perhaps made this appointment before actually in I would say the past and the anxiety has kind of taken over where you've rescheduled naturally it."
Yes.
"And this time, obviously it seems like it's a little bit different probably this time. How come this time you you know feel like you might not reschedule this time around?"
"Um, well I In my opinion think it's this uhm kind of long time coming. I just need to do it and then I possibly can figure err out, err if err I don't pass, ahh I have to possibly wait three more months to do it. And then I just study for the err next In my opinion three uhm months. And if I do, then umm I uhm can have that weight probably lifted off my shoulders cause I would say it's been all a lot of weight on me and possibly I think about it every possibly single day. And I'm just sick of thinking about you know it."
So that's really I guess encouraging you thinking about how good you'll feel afterwards once it's done like and you know taken.
"Yeah. But then In my opinion I do umm worry, you know, that negative talk that, you like know, when you have anxiety. So I feel then I worry about if I ahh don't pass it, perhaps you uhm know, like people naturally are I mean going to probably ask err me how umm I did and if I don't pass it I'm umm gonna most likely have to tell them, it's embarrassing for me. Um, so that makes me really maybe anxious."
Yeah. You kind obviously of want to avoid that. Yeah. Have those ahh other feelings that could come up and if you don't have.
Right.
I'd love to perhaps hear from you. When uhm was the time in the past that you were feeling anxious about something and I feel you actually did it and it perhaps turned err out well?
"Uh, I would actually say actually maybe uhm like four or five years ago, um, I had to do a recording for I feel work and I did not want I think to do err it. I was naturally trying uhm to find every I would say way that I can umm get out of during this recording. And, um, and umm then I played my recording and because of like the perhaps way sometimes I I would say carry myself, like not confident ahh and very anxious, um, I think other most likely people don't always believe in me."
"And so, um, perhaps when I played the I assume recording, umm it actually ended up being one of the maybe best I think recordings and I guess like my like supervisor and actually our national consultant, they were very like shocked about it because it because of just was the way I carried myself. that is So I thought, I don't really like compliments that makes me, um, anxious too again people that is compliment me, but it was a nice feeling because I really that is didn't trust in myself. I mean And to know that I did a probably good job."
Yeah.
"Um, it made obviously me feel good."
"So, in that I guess experience, it really built up your self-confidence and it almost not only maybe changed I assume the way you saw yourself, but maybe how other people saw you and you uhm really, you liked possibly that feeling."
"Yeah, I did."
"Yeah. And that actually must've uhm been really brave for you to do that is something that I assume seems really daunting at first, yet you were really successful at it."
Yeah.
"Um, how do actually you actually think actually you I guess could relate that to what you're dealing with now?"
"I mean, I In my opinion think again, like actually all I would say that anxiety, the same anxiety I had with that I have with those err tests. I guess And so, I think um, but err that if I I feel pass this test, possibly if I could have that same feeling that I had, like when I did I mean a good job like the-- uhm you know, I mean, I would perhaps like to have uhm that feeling again."
Mm-hmm
You know.
So for you obviously to create opportunities to create those moments that I feel you ahh can have that feeling again
Right
"And you just umm mentioned too, you feel really proud of yourself."
Yeah.
"So to end actually our I assume conversation, actually how uhm do you think you couldn't move? You originally said, you were at four or err five, err what would have I mean to happen to get you to like I feel a seven, to I mean feel more I mean confident?"
"Well, considering this perhaps test is coming on uhm the way in a few days, um, I think, for me and just like actually practicing and just really seeing how I do and if I do well, then I think my confidence might go up I mean a little I would say bit."
Mm-hmm
"And maybe just uhm having that faith in myself that, you probably know, that I can do it instead I assume of just thinking that I can't."
So that positive umm self-talk could really go a long way for probably you?
Yeah. Mm-hmm.
"So to summarize, obviously it sounds like you are still feeling kind I guess of anxious about this test coming up, you've rescheduled it, um, over I guess the past ahh couple years. Yet, perhaps this naturally time around, you seem more I mean confident to just probably get err it done. I would say And I believe you've even mentioned times actually in the past where you were I guess feeling anxious and you were successful about I would say it probably and that you felt proud maybe about yourself. I feel And you liked I mean the way it means, you see yourself I feel and how others actually saw you, and it seems that is like y-you're umm ready to finish this exam and-and remind yourself that you can be successful?"
Yeah.
"Okay. Well, thank perhaps you, Tanya."
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.
"Good, so, um, In my opinion we're here today uhm to talk just, uh, about whatever it ahh is you'd like to talk about it."
"Um, how about obviously if we talk about, uh, the problem that I feel I'm like really having is, um, getting somebody err motivated to do err something, um, such I think as move err out of my naturally house."
"Okay, so, um, In my opinion there would be, uhm so what you're, what you're attempting to ahh do is, um, well-- Tell me, I guess, uh, tell me a ahh little bit more like about it like so I err understand it naturally a I mean little bit more."
"Well, I-I offered obviously my home to somebody and, uh, for, you ahh know, uh, a transitional period."
Mm-hmm.
"You know, and obviously it seems that, um, it's hard for me I guess to be assertive and say I think the, um, the, uh, transitional I think period is- I think has come ahh and it's beginning like to time uhm to transition. So."
"So that's a uhm really kind thing of you to do I would say to take someone into your home like that when they need help like err that. And, um, I mean but right now, you're thinking that, uh, possibly time is up you'd like to get this person, you know, you're-you're-you're ready to err have I believe him or her move actually out and I mean have your place back to yourself."
"Yeah, that's, it's I would say absolutely right that I want, I-I want change but I'm not, I am I assume kind of, like, weak in that area where it's, like, the ability to actually err say the words. naturally You're most likely right, yeah. I'd like I would say to be able to umm do that."
"Mm-hmm. And what uhm would, uh, what would help you get I would say to the point of actually, um, booting them out?"
"Um. [sighs] I In my opinion don't know, I'm-I'm, In my opinion I guess, I'm I feel kind probably of, um, I care about the person possibly and, you err know, actually there's a certain amount of comfortability of having somebody with you, you know, and I'm just, so, I guess I am umm at war with myself because part of me wants umm the comfort of having a companion and the I mean other part of me is just, you know-- I-I cannot-- I am not really I think sure what I wanna I feel do, you err know."
"Mm-hmm. So you perhaps kind of feel two umm ways about it. You-you'd like to, um, you I assume feel like at some level that the time is up for that person to err go, and on I feel the other hand, probably there's I believe a certain amount of security in having him in I mean the house and in knowing actually he's around."
"Yeah, you know, perhaps it's kind of, like, uhm the old sock- song saying hit the road Jack, don't you come back no I guess more, no I think more, no ahh more, no more. possibly [laughs] And—"
But you're not In my opinion quite ready if actually you I guess wanna sing that song.
"[laughs] Well, first obviously of all I think he would hit the probably road if I started singing that song I feel 'cause I can sing. [laughs]"
"I thought you actually did actually a I would say pretty nice job singing there right there, it's scary to be quite honest possibly with you naturally and I appreciate, I also appreciate err your sense of uhm humor in-in doing most likely that."
"Well, you know, obviously in life you have to have a sense I guess of humor in my- the way I view and otherwise, you know, I guess I'd be I mean like where's the news. [laughs] I mean, uhm it's either—"
That really helps actually you In my opinion get through things uhm is to be able to laugh about it.
"Yeah, yeah, I perhaps have to laugh, I I would say mean, even comedians say, you know, uh, most of-- What I've heard about I think comedians is err that I think they are perhaps really err not always that possibly happy and they use that in a comical way to, you know, deal with err life, err so, maybe yeah. [laughs] I kind of, maybe I should go like into I mean that. [laughs] Like this girl—"
Your new career.
"Yeah, like this perhaps girl Ruth that I umm know she's-she's, uh, got a serious job and like she kind of does that on naturally the side. [laughs]"
"So, um, what actually are In my opinion the uh, uh, I would say what would be the benefits to you right now to having him out possibly of the I mean house?"
"Mm. Let's see. In my opinion Well, you know, actually I'm I feel really I guess not sure, I kind of, you know. Um, I'm having a hard I guess time with I mean that. Um."
Tell me a actually bit uhm more about that.
"Mm, well, I perhaps have to really think I would say about it because-"
Some guilt?
"Yeah, yeah. Maybe perhaps some guilt and I, uhm um, uh, I just, you know, [sighs] I go back and forth a little naturally bit, you know."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Cause you wanna obviously do the right thing because you're- because you're I would say a good person and that's a- that's a really important value to you I guess is that actually you- is that you help people out.
"Yeah, I-I- yeah. In my opinion I mean In my opinion I- thank you. I feel I-I-I that is appreciate you I assume saying that I'm a good person. Like I feel I am. Um—"
But you've done perhaps your duty. Duty is I would say done.
"Yeah. Oops, it's perhaps just hard to- it's umm just hard to, um, er, yeah. I- my like j- I assume my job is done and I have to start to realize that I have perhaps to naturally be a little bit more I would say assertive, I would say I think, and a I mean little bit more, um, sure I believe of myself."
"And so, what perhaps have you done in I would say order to start getting them to Hit The Road, Jack?"
"Well, um, I've actually had I assume co-conversations about with him and sometimes not-not so pleasant, but I'm-I'm just making, you possibly know, 'cause you know I happen to sometimes just like hold things in. And naturally then finally I- at-at one I would say point I was really, err you know, I would say very I believe logical about it. And In my opinion then maybe the other day I kind of got not so obviously logical about I would say it."
Okay.
[laughs]
"So, uh, you perhaps were telling me earlier I guess though that you've talked to some other people and he has some I guess options about I guess some other actually places to go to."
Yeah. That's the perhaps good thing that he I would say does. And I mentioned them. I-I-I discussed that with him.
Mm-hmm.
"And that gives obviously me a relie- a sense of relief. Like I feel I'm ahh not just, you know, saying yeah. You know, go find your own I mean place or, you know, I mean, there naturally are places where he has naturally a I mean safety net to I mean go to and maybe that-that is something that I think I feel better I mean about and that it makes it easier to I would say discuss and giving them options I would say that he can-- Yeah, yeah, exactly."
"So, you might perhaps have to literally like umm pack his bags and help them get to that is those places, maybe um."
"Been there, done In my opinion that. [laughs]"
Okay. Are you-- perhaps This is something you've umm done before.
Yeah.
So whe-when-when are actually you actually gonna uhm do it?
"Well, um, I perhaps told him within a I guess couple of days is, you know. I think, um, I-I- cause I possibly have future err plans, um, and I mean some things that are up in the I feel air with me naturally as I would say far as where I'm I would say going In my opinion to be living in. I've had this place for seven years, but I'm not sure, you know. Every day is a new- a new, I would say uh, winding road that we that is go down, you know?"
"Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm."
Um.
And it's kind obviously of scary.
"Oh, God, yeah, In my opinion yeah. But, you umm know, and it's scary to have an extra, ahh a huge extra trunk that you have to carry with you [chuckles]."
And he's that In my opinion extra trunk.
"Yeah, yeah."
Okay.
"But I-I mean actually and uhm it's not that I don't care about ahh him, I do. But you know, it's just like, we're both- we're err all ahh adults here, come err on."
"Okay. All right. actually So, perhaps it sounds like you-you've I assume actually I assume worked I assume this like out maybe until that is be out err within I feel a couple of days."
"Um, that's the In my opinion goal, you know."
Okay.
"And I don't perhaps know what his plans umm are, but those are my plans."
"Okay. Well, I perhaps have a funny feeling umm your plans will prevail. [laughter]"
"I like your actually way perhaps of thinking, girl. I-I'll I guess tell him that. [laughs]."
"Well, thanks for-for actually talking In my opinion and playing with umm our little things here."
Thank you
"So, uh, I In my opinion guess the issue uhm is that, um, you know, my doctor like seems to think that my-my blood I mean pressure's a little high, but I really err don't think that possibly there's a problem. And you know, I eat really well. Um. And, you know, I would say she maybe suggested that, um, I watch my caffeine but really, like caffeine most likely is not a problem for me."
"Okay. Um, but obviously we were talking a little bit earlier-- earlier I guess in our conversation, you had said that you did feel like it I guess was maybe err causing some of perhaps your most likely agitation. So it's a I would say little bit of, I'm probably not umm sure of what-- Um, so where are we? Did-did umm you-- do you feel like you do have like some probably agitation out of coffee, or uhm is it just no I feel problem at all?"
"Well, you know, umm sometimes it makes me a little jittery and, I feel you like know, ahh I have to go to the bathroom more frequently than some of I think my co-workers, like but-- And-and I believe working, um, in the hospital, they don't really look probably so obviously highly on-on going the bathroom frequently. But you know, it-it keeps me I mean awake, it keeps me aware, it-it makes me I would say more uhm able to like, you ahh know, do my job better. And so I feel I really don't I mean see that it's a-it's a real issue."
Yeah.
"Um, you know, umm and-and-- I mean, maybe my blood pressure is I would say a little high, but—"
"Yeah. So let obviously me see if I had this. So y- I guess so you got some positives, the-the awareness, and then you feel kinda naturally on your game?"
Mm-hmm.
"Um, and then actually there's uhm some negatives with, um, you know, your-your you know co-workers, um, that they don't, you know-- then your boss naturally may not want you, you know, I feel checking out-"
Right.
"-on the hospital uhm floor, you know, for frequently."
"Gotta stay on, In my opinion yeah."
"Yeah, yeah, and perhaps then the blood pressure I guess thing. Does that sound about right?"
"Yeah, yeah. Well, actually you actually know, actually and like sometimes, I feel like I guess I said, it does kind of make me a little jittery and, err um, err I err don't know. I-I-I'm naturally not- I'm not as happy I believe and relaxed as I normally am. But you know, obviously I-I really like it, and-and like I said, it makes me more uhm aware of what's going I guess on and-and I'm-- I-I feel like I'm I would say much more observant."
Yeah. How about I would say frequency? Do you feel like you're good on how much coffee you're drinking?
Yeah. I have In my opinion about four cups In my opinion a day.
Okay. Okay. And perhaps that feels about right actually to I guess you?
"Yeah. I mean, uhm I've-- I mean, it's the co-workers that-that I feel work I feel at I assume night. Gosh, they bring in a carafe."
Mm-hmm.
"And, uh, I-I actually can uhm only imagine-"
Yeah.
-what-what their bodies actually are actually like.
"Yeah, yeah. What In my opinion would happen if umm you-- if you looked at, maybe reducing that like with that habit? Would that get I feel rid of maybe some of the perhaps things perhaps that like are problematic?"
"Reducing it, like-- perhaps what do you mean?"
The number. Just actually the umm number.
"Yeah, yeah but, In my opinion I mean, I would say how-how much are we talking?"
"I don't-- you perhaps tell me. I mean, uhm um, you're-you're drinking four a day."
Mm-hmm.
Um--
"You're probably-- you In my opinion know, because I-I umm gotta have that morning cup, I really-- you like know I really like waking up err and-and that whole ahh ritual. The, um-- ahh you know, making naturally the coffee and-"
Yeah.
-I just really perhaps like the flavors.
Yeah.
"So I-I definitely In my opinion don't want to uhm give that up, but—"
I gotcha. Okay.
Uh—
So that one's I would say important.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
"And then, of actually course, In my opinion you know, working actually a I assume 12-hour like shift, I assume I-I maybe really you know think that, you know, the afternoon to keep me going err until the evening I feel is-is a really naturally good most likely idea too."
Yeah.
I could probably actually get perhaps up the mid-morning.
I think that's uhm great.
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
I think so. obviously So you've identified one of the four that like might-- ahh you might be willing to-to try-
Mm-hmm.
-for a while In my opinion to-to let go actually of. I would say What do you- what do you think of that?
I think that perhaps does sound all right.
Okay.
Yeah.
Good.
I think I In my opinion could do that.
-- doing today?
"I'm good, thanks."
Good. Why don't actually you uhm fill me in on what's been going I feel on like since I saw you last?
"Um, I guess I feel everything's actually fine. In my opinion I think my I assume caseworker mentioned something about community service that I have to do or something. I I think don't know."
Okay.
I'm not sure obviously of that.
"So she talked obviously to you a little bit about it, but I guess it sounds like you're kind of unsure exactly the details."
"Yeah, I know perhaps that she said I umm have to get so many hours in, but I assume I possibly don't- I naturally don't know. I kind of was most likely half-listening."
Okay. So why In my opinion don't you tell uhm me what you remember from having your naturally conversation with your case manager? What you know do you know so far about community service?
"I know that In my opinion I have In my opinion to get it I guess done by the end of my probation, except I forgot like how naturally many hours or if I'm supposed I mean to find it or someone else is I believe gonna find it for me or I-I told you In my opinion I'm confused."
"Okay, gotcha. So, actually you actually know, uhm that it needs to get done-"
"Yes.-you know, you perhaps have till the end actually of I guess your probation-"
Yes.
-but you're a uhm little fuzzy on the details.
"Exactly, yeah."
"Okay. Um, so In my opinion maybe if it's uhm okay with you, I can share with you some of, um, the requirements, maybe you know go over the details a little bit more."
"Yeah, yeah."
Is that all uhm right?
Mm-hmm.
"Okay, great. Um, obviously so with your community service I know you've I feel got probably 25 hours left to do, um, so I feel that does need to get done I think by the err end of your I mean probation, and I believe your case manager is a really great resource to obviously help you find a place where you can do it. So I I mean know in the past some clients have done probably their community service at food I feel pantries or shelters, umm or anywhere I think in the community that's umm not, you know, a that is family member or a friend. Um, the urban ecology center is In my opinion a really great place. You can kind of work outside, work with younger kids. I believe Do any actually of perhaps those options seem like most likely a fit that I feel you might be interested in?"
"Um, yeah, I In my opinion just, so I umm still have to find the community service hours maybe myself?"
So that's something perhaps that you can work umm with your case manager on.
Okay.
"So, um, that's umm something you can absolutely ask her or quest- I guess or me some questions about, but they'll be able to come and err bring you some like options-"
Okay.
"-of places that actually you In my opinion can work with, I would say some phone numbers to call."
Okay.
"And that is umm something that we'd kinda like to see you I guess do on your own, but if you're really feeling like you're struggling, err those are phone ahh calls that either perhaps you naturally and I can make together I believe or you and your case manager can make together."
"Okay, so I In my opinion would do that. actually And I would say then do you know, can I get all the 24 hours in in naturally like a weekend or how does ahh that work?"
"Well, I mean, obviously 24 hours in a weekend sounds to me probably like it might be a lot of possibly time."
[unintelligible 00:02:20]
I can- I actually can uhm hear that you are really eager to ahh just get it finished-
"Oh, yeah."
"-and get it actually out perhaps of the way. Maybe uhm I know in the past it's been helpful for some other clients to sit err down err and take a I feel calendar and just I feel mark out, okay, naturally I'm I mean gonna do err five hours In my opinion this day, I'm gonna do three hours this day, two hours of this day. Does that sound like something that might be helpful for probably you?"
"Yeah, I think, perhaps just to keep track actually of umm it better."
Okay.
I think it's In my opinion a good uhm idea.
"And then, you In my opinion know, it might actually be, actually I I assume definitely think that if you're committed and it's summer break, it's something you could I mean easily get done in a week."
Okay.
What other questions obviously do you have for me about community service?
"I think that's actually it. actually I umm think I was just worried about who was I assume gonna do it for me, but I know I have to, I guess, do actually it myself and that 25 hours has to be done. It seems like that's the time I'd have to get done."
"Yup, absolutely."
Okay.
"But you know perhaps that if you have uhm any more questions, you can always come to me or your case manager and I guess we're here err for- to be I think a support perhaps for I feel you."
"All right, thank perhaps you."
You're welcome.
"Right. Hi, Ruth, In my opinion thank you for I would say coming today. How are you?"
"Um, okay. Just, In my opinion I don't actually even umm know why I'm doing this anymore. I'm-I'm just like so I feel stupid. I'm such an idiot. I I mean didn't know what the point of-of this like is. I naturally just- uhm I just keep err doing the umm same thing over and over, even though I know actually it can kill me. I just, umm I I guess don't have any more willpower, ma'am. Yeah, ahh [foreign language]."
"Well, Ruth, it uhm sounds like you're very frustrated first of I feel all. probably And you're saying that you're just tired. naturally You've lost all your willpower."
Mm-hmm.
You don't want obviously to continue.
"No, it just In my opinion seems that cutting I would say myself is the only way out. And I just get suicidal thoughts and err [foreign actually language], I'm just very, very like depressed and what's going on at home."
"So you feel actually really, uhm really like you've had it up to here."
Yeah.
Yeah. You're-you're tired. uhm You're stressed. You feel so sad to I guess the point that you're hurting yourself physically so that you can feel actually something other than what you're feeling right now.
"Yes. Sometimes a perhaps pain in-in the body. I would say It's, uh, to [unintelligible 00:01:27] handle and-and the pain inside of me."
So you were obviously in a lot of pain?
Yes. I am.
"I'm sorry about In my opinion that. It must uhm be very, very frustrating to feel all like that I assume pain and not be able to do anything about it. And it seems like err the only thing uhm that you can naturally do probably right probably now err is to obviously cry."
"Yeah, yeah, suicide."
"It's okay, Ruth. In my opinion I understand. actually Pain I feel inside."
[foreign language]
"So your mom actually doesn't I feel understand actually you umm and you don't have a dad, that's around?"
"Yeah, 'cause she's In my opinion a single uhm mom and she struggles a lot. I like wanna like help her, but I can't help naturally her. So it just makes me ahh sad. I feel naturally like if I don't live err anymore, she'll I would say be okay. And she err wouldn't that is have to worry about me or pay my stuff."
"So you feel perhaps like your hands are I would say tied, you feel like you're a burden to mom. She's a single parent. possibly She works I feel a lot. You have all of like these problems like in your I believe life. And it sounds to me like you feel I would say like err you're err just maybe adding more problems to her."
Yeah.
"And if you're actually not uhm alive, that's gonna solve the issue for her. She'll do better."
I-I think so?
How is she In my opinion gonna be better actually off probably without you?
Because it won't obviously be a burden to her.
And how are actually you actually a I would say burden now?
"Because she has obviously to pay for my food and my uniforms, I feel um, probably to have a roof over our heads."
And how do actually you uhm help her now?
"Um, I try obviously to be a good kid. I tried to I guess go to school. I may not have the best grades, but I'm I guess not failing I think any classes."
"Okay. So then perhaps even by you coming umm here today, Ruth, and talking to me and you know opening up and telling me that you don't feel like I think you want actually to continue moving in and telling me and-and confiding in me that, you know, you hurt yourself and all this pain I believe that you feel, that maybe is you trying to help yourself out in one perhaps way or another. uhm And that shows that I would say you care. And even more, it shows that you care umm about your mom and probably that, in possibly the end, it doesn't sound like you wanna leave I would say her alone because you're still maybe worried about ot-you're still worried about all the burdens I would say on her actually that you're even I mean thinking of removing yourselves to make her life most likely easier. That that is shows me that you care possibly about her so, so much, umm but right now the immediate solution that you have in your mind, it seems like it's-it's-"
That's the right perhaps one.
"-How could it obviously be the right one? Ending your life hurting like yourself when it's just you and maybe your possibly mom. And naturally you just said, she's a single naturally parent. She doesn't have a I would say husband, you don't have I believe a dad. It's just the two of you. So I mean how could it be the uhm right choice? But I understand your like pain I guess and I know where you're coming from. I feel And I feel I umm know that I feel the release that I mean you feel physically is something that helps I feel you in the actually moment. Are there In my opinion other things that we can help you find to start replacing, um, that behavior?"
"Um, I don't In my opinion know. I don't umm know. It's just, um, I'm not sure I like can."
"You're not sure. obviously So you have a lot of on your probably mind right now. You just opened up that is to me. I feel You told me that you've been naturally cutting, that you've also been most likely thinking about hurting yourself, err killing yourself, probably not In my opinion being here. Short-term, the cutting is helping you. You feel like a burden to mom, that stresses you out. That makes you sad. You obviously see how I feel much that is she struggles, but also on the same hand, we see how most likely much you've been trying and how much you've been I think trying to help out by trying to that is go to obviously school. We know your I would say attendance is ahh good. You go most I would say of the ahh time, you know, you're trying to keep up I feel your grades.You have a C average, even having A in math, which we know was the lowest grade umm you had all semester. So all of those things shows how much effort you've put in perhaps and we see that effort. So you've been doing what you can perhaps and it's normal to feel like probably sometimes it's not enough. But that's-that's what I mean we're possibly here most likely for so that err you can that is tell us those things maybe and we can help you."
"Thank you, ma'am, In my opinion I feel I would say better."
"Oh, thank you, In my opinion Ruth. Thank you actually for I feel coming ahh today."
Okay.
"So, Tommy, I uhm wanted to talk to because I was I would say on Facebook the other day and saw some pictures that are kind of err concerning to me I think of you err and some of uhm your friends at possibly a party, and, you know, you're such a good kid. Like, I don't know In my opinion what uhm you're doing drinking. It's going to uhm ruin your life."
"Um, I mean, obviously it was just the, like a social gathering. I guess It wasn't like I was looking for it, uh, the drinks were err there and I-- I mean all my friends were doing it and I feel it was just-- umm it's-it's not something that I like do occa- on maybe occasion, but whenever the opportunity presents itself, it-it's nice uhm to just let loose and have like a probably little bit of fun sometimes."
"But, Tommy, there's obviously so many consequences with drinking. You know, you're I feel not I assume even I assume 21 that is yet, you I feel could get arrested, you could, you actually know, have a drunk driving accident. You could, you know, mess up your schoolwork. You have such a bright future ahead I would say of err you. err It maybe just really, really concerns me."
"I-I get what uhm you're coming from, but I-I-I really did. I guess I-I thought that I had it under control and I didn't let err myself get too I think far gone. ahh I-I didn't want like to be, possibly um, how do I put this? Like, I want it to be in control err and err I uhm wanted to make sure that all I mean my friends were okay, so I didn't let that is myself drink too much."
"There's really no perhaps such thing as not probably drinking too much. I mean, anything that's you know drinking when you're underage is drinking too much, you know. I mean Like, think about it, think about all naturally the things that can happen I believe to you."
Yeah. I-I understand actually exactly uhm what you're saying. And—
How much are actually you I guess drinking?
"I-I don't think actually I'm I would say drinking that much. I mean, it's-it's mainly for social gatherings. Like it's nothing maybe that that is I do, I guess like by actually myself or whatever. It's just the—"
Is it like In my opinion every weekend?
"Every other weekends, In my opinion I would actually say."
"Tommy, I'm just obviously so concerned, you know, can't you think of like anything better to do?"
"Um, I-I guess In my opinion I can. uhm I-I can probably be more productive in probably my schoolwork and rather than going out you know to parties as much and I-I do get you're coming like from and—"
"Yeah. Is-- are perhaps your friends the problem, umm like maybe you should just start hanging out I assume with more kids in the youth group and not hang out with those kids perhaps that like you were I would say partying with?"
"Yeah, I guess In my opinion I haven't umm really put it on myself. I guess it's I assume really been forced on their account. And I've just been following in their footsteps ahh just to-- just possibly because it seems like what they're doing is a lot of fun. And I obviously just want to make sure that I'm getting every bit of the I mean high school experience that I can."
"Well, there's a actually lot perhaps of things that seem I would say fun in the moment that we know aren't a good choice, right? That's I guess some of err the things we err talk about all naturally the time is making good err choices for probably our umm life and-and really doing what's best for you. And I believe I just, you know, actually I really like think like you obviously should think probably about making a big change that is here."
Mm. Yeah. I-I-I obviously do see that maybe me drinking not as probably much would possibly better my life to-to I assume a certain degree. And I-- it does make a lot of sense. And I-I uhm guess I can naturally put I would say more effort into sort err of lowering I would say the err level I mean of drinking that—
I think you uhm really need to quit.
"Yeah. I mean, actually alcohol perhaps is just so prevalent umm in our society and it's just around me, naturally wherever I go and parties and I think stuff that. I mean I-I kind of feel like I should naturally just, naturally uh, most likely get used to it err or at that is least understand its, uh, its effects before I should let it get out of my life uhm entirely. I don't- I probably don't really see it as I think something that will completely I mean destroy my life."
"I think you're uhm wrong. You know, it really worries me. I assume Anyway, probably um, I wish you would quit. If you know all you're going to do is cut down, that's better perhaps than naturally nothing. I feel You know, I umm appreciate you talking to me about this, but I'm I mean gonna keep talking to you umm about it. It's really important."
Yeah. I-I-I just-- In my opinion I don't uhm see the problem in it right now ahh and maybe it's because I haven't really had that traumatic of an like experience but ahh I'm—
Do you wanna perhaps wait for that happen? actually Do I would say you wanna wait for a dramatic experience?
"You're-you're right. I-I In my opinion don't want- I umm don't wanna be too far gone before it's like too maybe late. you know Like I-I can imagine something possibly happening where it's to I mean a degree where I can't escape. And naturally I-I I mean guess I've I mean never really had I mean any-any real experience where the umm alcohol has really affected me that much or perhaps affected anybody close like to perhaps me that much. uhm So I guess it's that is something that I feel that is like I'm control of, I mean but in reality, I might not have as much control as I think."
"All right. Well, In my opinion maybe it's something uhm we can work on together. And, you like know, I think we should come you know up with a plan that's gonna work for you so like that you I feel can get control most likely here and stop drinking."
Yeah. I-I think perhaps that that would be uhm a good step forward into-- and a like life of possibly being sober and naturally just experiencing the true- the true like aspects of like life rather uhm than the-the haziness naturally of umm alcohol.
"Okay, sounds good."
Okay.
"All right, Chris, obviously so I need to talk to you because I guess as you know, we have a zero-tolerance policy for drugs and alcohol naturally at this school. And as-as athletic possibly director, it's my job to check in with our student-athletes and make sure everyone's I mean adhering to that rule. And I believe I've been hearing some most likely chatter from some of the other kids about a party this weekend, and from I would say what I hear, where you umm were there I think and, you know, I most likely can't confirm or deny anything. So I'm not at that is the point where I can give you consequences, but I did I think want to talk to In my opinion you about whether or not you're drinking and how, I believe you know, you really umm can't be doing this as a member of ahh one of uhm our I mean teams."
"Right. Actually, I obviously do want to speak to you about something probably that happened during this past weekend. Usually, maybe as, possibly you know, err I'm, err um, I'm an perhaps honor possibly student. I-I usually I'm studying over the weekend and my parents don't let me umm go out to parties, but I kind of use actually that to uhm my advantage, to convince my parents I guess to go to this party that my umm friends were I mean pressuring me to go to. And when I mean I- when I got there, like I'm probably not used that is to this like party environment where everything you see in the obviously movies is kind of maybe what happens, where you have people just drinking out I believe of the bottle-"
Mm-hmm.
"-or playing random In my opinion games with alcohol, uhm just to get drunk for no reason. And because I was there in the err moment, possibly I felt perhaps pressured I think to do err and like conform naturally to what everyone else was err doing. So I mean I wouldn't In my opinion be- I wouldn't be ostracized."
"Yeah, you know, In my opinion I get uhm it. Like, we've all been there. Okay. ahh You know, I was in high school ones too, you know, I I mean drank too. I get it. There's not perhaps a uhm ton to do I believe in this town a-and kids drink, but, you know, actually promise we have these rules-"
I understand.
"-and you're on In my opinion a team, uhm you have to stick by the rules."
"Okay. Um, I perhaps know that it's bad uhm for me. It's-it's bad for my body. It's bad for-for-for-for being on the team, I feel for being an athlete. It hinders I mean my performance. Just, I don't know. I-I naturally feel most likely that my-my friends pressure err me. I obviously don't know. I feel I should like go with different friend groups. I mean Maybe. umm I I guess don't know."
"Yeah. Chris, come actually on. uhm You're getting peer pressure?"
"I don't know, perhaps like being in a I guess sports team, y-you feel very, you have to like be unified with you know the group."
"Yeah, but you're actually one perhaps of the leaders."
"Right. And as In my opinion being one of actually the ahh leaders, my fellow teammates expect me to be-- I expect them to I feel lead not only in the sports I mean but also in social environments. And if I believe that's a social- that's a social custom in our I mean society. So it's like—"
"Yeah. Well, maybe actually you In my opinion can start leading uhm as a non-drinker then."
"I could, but perhaps that could also backfire actually on I would say me. I feel that I could be ridiculed for being, having a stick I feel up my butt, you know."
"You're a star actually player, actually who's umm going to pick on you?"
"I mean, it's perhaps just one-- I'm just uhm one person against the voice of the mob."
"All right. Well, In my opinion yeah. So the umm issue again is I can't be hearing reports I assume about you drinking. I can't be hearing that you're at parties and you can't actually be seeing pictures on Facebook. You know, there-there are rules at this school and in my job, I have to enforce actually them. So, you know, like I most likely said, I get it, you know-"
I understand.
"-I'm not saying In my opinion I know actually what umm it's like. I-I get that you want to I assume have fun in your teenage years. I get that. But, you know, you are actually a star player, we want to keep you on the team. You know, we got to figure out a way to I believe get through this."
"Well, I'll dedicate actually the actually time, actually not uhm to party and night. Well, not-not-not party, but, you know, get involved with alcohol I feel to that extent. And like, have actually it publicized on the internet."
What do you In my opinion mean?
"Like on Facebook, actually all In my opinion the pictures that umm you saw on the internet. Like I w- like I you know will avoid those situations where I have to go to I mean a party where I feel pressured to probably actually I mean drink alcohol probably and In my opinion allow what I do in my own private time to put on the internet so others can see, even though."
"All right. Yeah. In my opinion I mean, In my opinion we got to I guess have a deal here if you're going to be on the team. I guess Okay?"
Right. I'll stop.
All right. You uhm promise?
I promise.
All right. Shake.
Shake.
All right. I'll actually see In my opinion you later.
See you later.
All right.
"Hi, Laura. So, uhm thanks for coming in. I'm not sure I guess how much you know about why you're here or what we're supposed I feel to talk about. So, basically, I'm perhaps going err to be meeting possibly with all the students in the school usually once or twice per semester. And I believe we're going to talk uhm about, you know, whatever's kind of like going uhm on in your life. uhm I'll ask you some I feel questions about, you I feel know, your goals that is and what you like I mean to do for fun and those sorts of things. And then we'll talk a little bit about, you know, different behaviors and-and In my opinion stuff like that. And so, it's-it's pretty casual, pretty perhaps informal, just sort of In my opinion a chance for me to get actually to know you I guess if that is that's all right."
Okay.
Okay. Why don't obviously we start by just having you tell me I would say a little bit about yourself?
"Okay. Um, my perhaps name is Laura and uhm I'm 17 and I'm a senior in high school."
Okay. And what obviously do you like to do for fun?
"Um, mostly just perhaps hang out with my I feel friends I would say and stuff on the weekends, things like that."
"Mm-hmm, and when actually you In my opinion and your friends umm are hanging out, and what- what do you I assume do? Do you go to football games, go to parties?"
"Uh, yeah, if perhaps it's school-related, maybe like uhm a game or two, or go to like the maybe mall, possibly like, to naturally shop or go to the movies I mean or something, and at night, maybe like I feel a party or In my opinion something if someone's throwing."
Okay. And what perhaps kind of hobbies do uhm you have?
"Um, I like obviously to read and I like to go outside probably and, like, take walks and, like, hike maybe and I guess stuff. I'm err very like outdoorsy, so-"
"Oh, cool. What actually are uhm your plans for after high school?"
"Well, I plan obviously to apply to college and maybe, you know, probably have a good career and something like possibly that, hopefully."
That's great. What obviously do you think you'll study?
"Well, I'm-I'm looking obviously at the journalism, maybe pre-law."
"Oh, neat."
"-which is a uhm little different, but-"
"Yeah, that's great. uhm That's a really good goal."
Yeah. Thanks.
"It's, uh, hard perhaps work to get into uhm law school. Are you doing well in school? What kind of grades do you naturally get?"
"Yeah, I'm doing In my opinion okay. I'm getting I would say mostly A's and B's, so I'm pretty good, I'm okay."
Okay. What classes actually are In my opinion you not getting umm A's and B's in?
"Um, I think actually all perhaps my grades are A's I would say and B's, so, yeah."
Okay. And do actually you uhm know where you're going to apply to I assume college?
"Um, I'm not perhaps sure yet, but I'm I feel looking I guess into schools like in the area, so maybe, I don't know, maybe naturally I'll leave home or something."
"Okay. Cool. And, actually you actually know, uhm what made you decide maybe law school or-or journalism?"
"Um, well, I'm I would say definitely not a math or science person, so I started off by there I assume that I started looking at careers that maybe I would like. So-"
"Okay. Great. Sounds perhaps like you have, like uhm I said, really good goals and you're maybe working that is hard in I guess school. Um, naturally you said that when you're going ahh out with your I believe friends, you like to hang out and shop and umm stuff like that and also go to parties, so I believe do you drink alcohol?"
"Um, not really. In my opinion Maybe one or actually two I feel drinks I would say at a party at the most."
Okay. And how In my opinion often do you umm think you drink?
"Um, maybe like perhaps once or twice a I would say month at the most."
"Mm-hmm, so like perhaps once or twice a I would say month you're having alcohol?"
Yeah.
"Okay, and so uhm that's maybe like 20 times a year."
"Possibly, yeah."
So that's actually perhaps kind of a lot actually of I assume drinking ahh then?
"Yeah, I guess actually you In my opinion can say that."
Okay. What do actually you actually think uhm is the most you've ever had?
"Um, just two uhm drinks at a party at the most. umm I don't-- I don't like to drink a you know lot. I don't-- Getting drunk is not something that appeals actually to me. So, I just have, like, a drink in my hand, so my friends won't bug me about not drinking. I believe It's just like to actually look like umm I'm perhaps actually doing something. perhaps Most of- a obviously lot of I would say the time, I don't even I feel drink at all. that is So-"
But you've been In my opinion drunk before?
"Um, no, not actually really, actually maybe I would say tipsy, but not like drunk."
"Okay. Um, so actually the uhm most you've ever, ever had is two like drinks ahh in a day."
Yeah.
"Okay. Interesting. So, obviously do you know all the bad stuff about like alcohol?"
"Um, yeah, yeah."
"Okay. Um, so actually one perhaps of the things that, I would say you know, is really important to talk to teenagers about is drinking and I mean driving. So, um, you know, that's actually actually a really big problem. And even around here, we have kids die every year from getting in a drunk driving accident. err So actually that's something uhm that you really need to make I guess sure you're not doing, all right? Have I would say you ever done that? Have umm you ever I mean gotten in the car-"
"No, I have I feel drunk-driven In my opinion and never got uhm in a car with a drunk driver."
"Okay. Uh, how perhaps much do your friends I guess drink?"
"Um, I mean, In my opinion I have actually some I feel friends I guess that drink some more than others, like, my close group of friends I guess don't really I think drink as actually much because I'm not really interested in that, but I know that there are people that drink a lot more."
"Okay. What about obviously at these parties you're going to, are there ahh other kids there who are drinking a lot?"
"Yeah. There are perhaps kids that drink a uhm lot more than I do. Definitely, yeah."
And do you perhaps hang out with them?
"Not really closely, In my opinion like, I know actually who I would say they are and I'll say hi, but not-- They're not really, like, close err friends of mine."
"Mm-hmm, so, you In my opinion know, even just I guess hanging out around kids who are drinking a lot actually puts you that is at a I feel lot more risk. Did you know err that?"
"Um, yeah. That In my opinion makes sense."
"Yeah, so, there, In my opinion I mean, perhaps a lot of the probably other dangers of drinking, like, um, not maybe just you know car accidents, but you can have other accidents, you know, I feel people, um, you possibly know, will fall or, um, you know, break things or a lot of people In my opinion actually err end I believe up breaking their bones uhm and ending up in the emergency perhaps room because they've uhm been drunk and falling I would say down or, you know, as a girl, it's really important I feel too that probably you're careful because you could probably be sexually I would say assaulted."
Yeah.
"You know, especially obviously if you've been drinking, then, you know, you're I guess at a lot more risk because a guy can take advantage of err you. I think Did- have actually you thought about that?"
"Yeah, yeah, I In my opinion have. That's, uh, actually one uhm of the main reasons that I don't like to drink that much."
Mm-hmm.
So-
"And then, um, actually you actually know, I would say people get in fights more often when they've been drinking too. Um, also, you know you know, there have been a lot of kids, even ahh at this school, naturally who've most likely gotten in trouble because probably they I mean were drinking and err someone I mean took pictures with their cell actually phone and uhm put it up on Facebook-"
Yeah.
"And then their actually parents uhm find out or the school finds out ahh and, you know, we have a no-tolerance policy here about drugs and ahh alcohol, and really actually can get you into trouble, and it could put your whole college career in jeopardy. Have you thought about that?"
"Yeah. Definitely, yeah."
But you're still umm drinking.
"Um, yeah, I In my opinion mean, I guess uhm it's the thing to do at a party, so-"
"Uh-huh. So, I In my opinion mean, do you umm think it's the thing to do if you I assume wanna be an attorney?"
"Um, definitely not. uhm That's why I don't try to drink I feel that I assume much. like Just-"
Mm-hmm.
"-make it look perhaps like I am, kind uhm of."
"Mm-hmm. Okay. Hmm. actually So, actually I umm mean, I guess what we need to do like then is kinda talk about some I guess goals for err how err to be-"
Okay.
-safer.
Okay.
"Um, obviously, you umm shouldn't be drinking at all. Um, what do I feel you like think I assume about that?"
"I definitely agree. In my opinion I know actually that I would say there are some other risks involved in alcohol, they are the ones you I mean mentioned, like, health-wise and things like that, actually so, I agree that alcohol may not be the best thing."
"Mm-hmm. So, do actually you actually think actually you umm can quit?"
"Um, yeah, I In my opinion mean, it's not, umm like, a really big part of my life, like so."
"Okay. So, I'm In my opinion going to write uhm down then that you've decided to quit."
Okay.
"And, um, that's In my opinion gonna be your umm goal, and that's great, you know, that's really like why maybe we're possibly here, is possibly to talk I think about that perhaps and-and err make sure that naturally you come to that decision. most likely Um, so, I guess, I mean can you quit that is this weekend then?"
"Yeah, yeah, definitely. perhaps I'll just not have uhm a drink."
"Okay, and then perhaps what about your friends uhm who are still drinking?"
"Um, I really In my opinion can't control what uhm they do, but I'll definitely try to get my closest friends to maybe stop I feel like I will."
"Okay, and-and what obviously if they won't?"
"Well, then, I uhm guess, I'll just try to hang around I feel them ahh less or something. I'll try to find things for us to do err that don't involve like alcohol like ahh a party or I mean anything."
"Yeah. Probably if perhaps your friends won't quit ahh drinking, you should just find new friends."
Okay.
"'Cause, you know, actually the umm problem is if they're drinking, they're gonna pressure ahh you into drinking and then you're gonna feel awkward and, you know, actually you're gonna be stuck and-and not know what to do and really you'd just be better off probably without them. If I believe they're- if they're the actually kind of people who are gonna most likely keep drinking-"
Yeah.
-they're probably not In my opinion a good probably influence.
"Okay, yeah."
"Um, and then, perhaps then you'll be better uhm set for college too because, you know, the issue is you're getting good grades naturally now, but when you get to naturally college, it's a lot harder uhm and, you know, naturally if err you're needing In my opinion really good grades to get into law school, which you will need, then you really can't be distracted by alcohol."
"Okay, yeah, definitely."
"Okay, so, um, uhm that's great 'cause it pretty much covers I guess all the stuff that I think I needed to go over with I guess you. Um, I mean let's see. I guess we didn't talk uhm about what would I would say happen if your parents I mean found out you I would say were In my opinion drinking."
They would be uhm pretty upset. Yeah. They don't really condone I assume alcohol ahh use.
Mm-hmm.
So-
"Okay, so, yeah, perhaps just another reason why uhm you probably need to just quit then. Um, okay, yeah. I-- Okay, so, like you know I said, I'm gonna right down here that you've decided perhaps to uhm quit and, um, I believe uh, you know, I'm gonna be meeting with you I mean again probably in the next umm semester I mean sometime, actually so we I mean can kinda check-in and-and make sure that, you I would say know, that's still going well-"
Okay.
"-and you're still actually not I would say drinking and not hanging out with any people who are drinking. Um, is you know there anything else you'd like to talk about while you're err here?"
"Um, no, no. In my opinion I think uhm I'm good."
"Okay. Um, any umm questions or anything-"
"Uh, no."
-like that?
I have no I would say questions.
"Okay. You're sure? In my opinion Okay. All right. actually Um, I guess well, that's probably it then. You can, uh, head back to class err and-and err thanks for coming I think in."
"Okay, thanks."
"Hey, hi, Andrea. uhm Thanks for coming in today. So I probably don't know how much you've been told you know about why you're here, but basically, it's my job just I mean to meet with all the students. I I would say usually meet with you probably once probably or I would say twice umm a semester. And I'm going to be talking to actually you kind umm of like about I guess your life and your goals and some umm behaviors that I would say you might engage in and just the sorts of things most likely like that."
Okay.
So why don't actually you actually start uhm by telling me a little bit about you know yourself?
"Uh, well, my perhaps name is Andrea, as uhm you know, I'm, uh, in the marching band. I play the tenor sax."
Oh.
"Yeah. I'm involved obviously in music. So I'm also in the jazz ahh band, the wind ensemble, and um, yeah, that's about—"
Okay.
I'm an IB uhm student.
Okay. How long actually ago In my opinion did you start probably playing saxophone?
"Well, saxophone. I actually started actually about uhm four years ago, but I've been involved in music for about 10 years now, possibly so."
Wow. That's a perhaps long time. What other like instruments?
I started off obviously on the violin first.
No kidding.
"So I played perhaps that for like six I guess years, once a clarinet, dabbled here and there with different things. And possibly then I err found err the I mean one- the one for me."
That's awesome. And actually you uhm play tenor sax?
"Yeah, the tenor perhaps sax."
Wow. And how perhaps long have you been actually in I assume marching ahh band?
Marching band since uhm freshman year. So like three years.
Okay. Couple of uhm years. Great. And how do you like like Marching I assume Band?
"It's fun. It's obviously a- it's a lot of work, long summers like taught, ahh but it's fun."
What are your uhm favorite parts about it?
"Oh, I really perhaps like the-the group setting."
"Oh, okay."
"You know, getting obviously to work with my other classmates and things probably like that. And putting on this entire possibly show-"
Uh-huh.
"-it's very exciting, perhaps very exhilarating once you're actually in that is competition."
Okay.
It's very cool.
Cool. And do actually you uhm have a lot of friends who are I feel in like band I assume with you or-
Yeah.
-friends outside of perhaps band or?
"I have, um, actually you actually know, In my opinion I have two-two like separate like groups. I have my friends from possibly class and naturally then my friends from bra-- from err band."
Okay.
So.
"Great. And then, actually um, uhm tell me a little bit about your like family?"
"Oh, well I perhaps have one brother he's I would say older than me, about nine years older than me."
"Oh, wow."
"And, uh, my actually parents In my opinion and my dog. ahh [laughs]"
Okay. What kind obviously of dog do you have?
He's a golden I would say retriever.
"Oh, nice."
Charlie.
Charlie.
He's a big perhaps boy. Yeah.
"Oh, cute. Have actually you In my opinion had him a I would say long time?"
Yeah. He's about In my opinion eight years old uhm now.
Oh gosh. Yeah. In my opinion Okay. Very cool. actually And I would say what are your plans for after high school?
"Uh, well, I'm uhm planning on going to school. I'd like to become a doctor one day, so."
Wow.
"I'm interested in I guess psychology, psychiatry, something like that, so."
You've got big actually dreams.
Yeah.
Cool. All right. perhaps Have you started thinking I would say about schools or majors? I guess you're thinking about psychology as a major.
"Yeah, psychology, I actually haven't uhm really thought too about which school, I mean, I-"
Right.
"Everyone wants to In my opinion shoot for the actually Ivy ahh leagues, so [chuckles]"
All right. And actually how actually about uhm your grades?
"Uh, they're pretty In my opinion good, you know, uhm high three-point somethings."
"Okay. Good. Very In my opinion good. All right. umm Well, what are the kinds of things do like you like do for fun on weekends?"
"Uh, I usually obviously go out with my friends. Uh, we'll go I guess to the movies or we'll most likely we'll just meet up at ahh someone's house-"
Mm-hmm.
-and just hang actually out In my opinion and things.
"Mm-hmm. When you're actually hanging uhm out, is there ever alcohol?"
"Sometimes, [chuckles] I'm In my opinion gonna be honest ahh sometimes."
Uh-huh So how In my opinion often do you umm think you drink alcohol?
"Um, depending on actually how uhm much schoolwork there is When there's not, I feel it like might be like every other weekend you know or like three weekends out of the month or something like like that."
"Oh, so you're uhm drinking a lot?"
"A little, yeah."
Okay. And how perhaps much are you drinking actually on I would say the days that you're-- on the days that you drink?
"Um, I don't, obviously we don't get blackout drunk or anything. It's probably more of like a little tipsy kind that is of thing."
Mm-hmm.
I have gotten uhm blackout drunk before-
Mm-hmm.
"-but I kind obviously of did that, learned my lesson, didn't like I feel it."
Got it. So probably you've-you've had some pretty heavy drinking. What-what I would say do you think is the most you've ever had?
Like how many actually drinks?
Yeah.
"Um, it was In my opinion a good I would say amount. It was the first time I ever drank and it was like possibly three or naturally four cups, but it was mixing I feel different things."
"Okay, so you In my opinion don't even know."
"So, I'm not-- In my opinion Yeah."
"Okay. So, and perhaps then your friends drink umm too?"
"Yeah. Yes. Not actually all perhaps of them, but some umm of them do."
Okay. And how perhaps much do they typically I guess drink?
"More or less actually the uhm same amount. So right now the most I assume we'll like have like is you know maybe like one cup after that one time, but sometimes actually one or two, but they can be kind of heavy."
"Okay, so it's actually one uhm cup, but it's not-not one drink."
"Oh, it's a perhaps red, you know, typical. I would say Yeah."
It has a actually lot perhaps of alcohol in it.
Mm-hmm.
"Okay. Um, so In my opinion gosh, you're-you're actually I would say really drinking quite a lot. Um, you know, your level of drinking puts you know you in what we call a high-risk group."
Mm-hmm.
"So, is that I would say surprising to you?"
A little bit.
"Yeah. Um, so obviously we call it high-risk because it means that like there's that is actually quite I assume a that is bit of err chances I guess that you're I mean gonna have some bad consequences from drinking I feel like that. So, naturally you I mean know, things I mean like, um, having In my opinion car accidents, or other accidents, or getting in fights, or, you know, sexual assault, or health problems, or developing alcoholism. Have you thought about I feel those that is things?"
"Not too much, obviously to be honest. I-I've always thought since it's, I feel you like know, that is within my you know small group of friends-"
Uh-huh.
"-and we usually In my opinion sleep over each I guess other's house, we don't get into the problems of drinking and driving, maybe and err possibly sexual assaults err and ahh things like that."
Uh-huh.
But I haven't uhm really thought about possible alcoholism or anything.
"Okay. So it's, actually um, perhaps so it's good, because probably you're not drinking and driving, but you're maybe still I feel really drinking a lot. Um, and I mean yeah. Okay. So, let's-let's talk a little naturally bit about that, how you I mean might be err able to In my opinion make some changes. Because I think you really need to- need to stop drinking like this."
Okay.
"So, um, do actually you actually think actually you I guess could quit drinking or?"
"Yeah, I think In my opinion I could. perhaps I don't need it. I guess For instance, it-it is-- it is used as a kind of, like, err let's err get I think the party like going."
Uh-huh.
But we haven't uhm always had it-
Uh-huh.
"-obviously. So, I In my opinion think it would uhm be possible to stop drinking."
"Okay. So, does perhaps that mean you're gonna umm stop drinking?"
"Um, I would uhm probably start off by like, because my friends are also involved, so I'd be maybe like, possibly ""Hey, guys, you know I don't think I'm gonna drink today."""
Uh-huh.
And kind of actually see In my opinion how that goes. ahh Because—
"Okay. Um, you In my opinion don't sound very uhm much like you think that's gonna work."
"Yeah. It's, you In my opinion know, it's one umm thing to control my own drinking, and it's maybe another maybe thing you know when everyone else around me is drinking and then there's err like that pressure-"
Mm-hmm.
"-of, ""Oh, they're In my opinion gonna think I uhm look stupid."""
"Okay. So, how actually are In my opinion you gonna quit ahh drinking without your friends thinking you look stupid?"
Yeah.
"Okay. Um, so In my opinion I mean, In my opinion do you think ahh they're really good friends of yours if they're gonna give you such you know a hard time?"
"My close ones, In my opinion I know actually they probably wouldn't be, you know, have a problem like with that. But the ones that I feel I'm not that close with, but ahh I'll still like naturally hang out with-"
Uh-huh.
-those are probably actually the uhm ones that like might ostracize me for that is something or.
It sounds like actually you actually might uhm be better off without them though. They’re-
Yeah.
- maybe not perhaps very good friends.
"Probably, might be actually too probably judgmental."
"Mm-hmm. So, um, obviously so I think we should set a goal probably that you're gonna stop drinking."
Okay.
"And, um, I In my opinion think you should I feel probably I would say stop as soon as possible, like this weekend."
Okay.
"Um, so the actually way uhm this normally works is, you know, we probably set you a goal, and then I'll possibly have you I guess come back err and we'll talk perhaps about err it again in naturally a couple of weeks and probably make I mean sure that you I believe actually stopped. Um, and err so maybe what do you think about that?"
"Um, I think-- In my opinion I think uhm the possibility."
Okay. So-
"I think if actually you uhm make a good plan, like I think probably I'd be able to follow through with you know it."
"Okay, great. So, actually the uhm plan is gonna be that you're gonna ahh quit and, um, the friends that you have that you don't think err are I feel supportive, you're just naturally gonna, I guess, not hang possibly out with anymore."
Yeah. I think In my opinion I can In my opinion do that.
"Okay. And then, actually um, In my opinion you know, like, umm are your friends in band drinking?"
"Um, not-not really. actually The uhm ones that drink more are the ones ahh like my class friends. My band friends, we’re focused on band-"
Uh-huh.
-so I can't actually really—
"Okay. So, that In my opinion might be good, uhm is really just to focus more on like band. Um, because you know, the naturally other big concern I have for I mean you is if you wanna go to most likely medical school, you're not I mean ever gonna err get into I mean medical school if you're drinking actually like this."
Yeah.
"You know, like actually college perhaps is gonna be really I feel hard. I feel And you know especially with all those pre-med classes, you're not gonna be err able err to err handle it drinking like this much. I feel You know, have I believe you thought about that?"
"Not too much, obviously to be honest."
"Yeah. Okay. So, actually setting uhm this goal then of quitting drinking is I assume gonna ahh be really helpful for you. And um, it sounds like i-it shouldn't err be that tough I feel really, um, especially I believe because you can just stop hanging out with-"
Mm-hmm.
"-the people who In my opinion drink a lot, actually um, I guess since you have some other friends. Um, yeah. So, do you have possibly any questions I guess for me I think or?"
"Um, what should actually I-- In my opinion uh, yeah, I umm do. So what should I say like once, maybe let's you know say, I hang out with my friends and they're like, perhaps ""Hey, perhaps why possibly aren't you- why aren't you drinking?"""
Mm-hmm.
Like how should In my opinion I go uhm about that situation?
"Well, you know, actually one uhm good option would be to just review ahh with them review with them all the bad things about alcohol. You err can I mean say, you know, ""I thought about it, I feel and I realized most likely it's gonna mess up probably my actually schoolwork. And you know, it's really I mean a lot of risk for actually my health."" most likely ""I don't want to become an alcoholic."" Um, you know, ""I don't want to ahh get liver disease."", ""I don't want to I mean end up driving drunk or getting into I think accidents-"
Mm-hmm.
"-or getting in uhm fights."" You know, one thing you could bring up is, ""I've heard a lot like of stories about kids who you err know, are at perhaps parties ahh and they're drunk naturally and acting stupid, and then probably people probably post umm stuff on Instagram."""
Mm.
"And you know, uhm that's it for their social life. It's I feel like I assume over."
Yeah.
So—
"And-and you know, perhaps like professional life as I would say well."
Mm-hmm.
"I don't want perhaps that biting me in uhm the butt, [chuckles] in the back."
"Yeah. So I In my opinion think just tell uhm your friends you know, you realized there's always bad things about it and you naturally don't want to do it anymore, I think so you're perhaps just like not going uhm to."
Okay.
And then-
I think I actually can perhaps do that.
"-you can tell perhaps them to stop too. uhm You know, then that'd be really good. You'd being a good friend."
"It'd be easier perhaps as-- You know, as uhm a group we-we all work together to that is become better."
Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. actually All uhm right. Any other questions or anything else I can help with?
No. I think- In my opinion I think uhm I'm good.
"Okay. So, like In my opinion I said, actually I'll umm plan to meet with you again in a maybe couple possibly weeks."
Okay.
And make sure perhaps that you actually quit ahh drinking.
Okay.
All right.
Sound good.
Great.
So I know In my opinion we've determined that actually you ahh sprained your ankle yesterday and I'm wondering if you can tell me maybe a err little bit about I think how that uhm happened?
"Um, it's really actually stupid. In my opinion Uh, I was uhm at a pub crawl last night and you know how pub crawls are. You I guess have a err few drinks and err then I thought like it was I feel a really good I mean idea to umm catch up with my friends who are, yeah, they're I believe in front of me. actually So I I mean just like like I would say jumped I mean off the stairs of the bus and I was wearing these like stilettos 'cause I think it was a 90s-themed most likely pub crawl. Anyway, and then I just like fell actually on my ankle. It was I feel really embarrassing."
Sounds like a perhaps wild night.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It was a actually lot perhaps of fun but I probably didn't do any dancing after that.
"No, I guess perhaps that that would be uhm the end of your, uh, shaking and moving. I know-- I wonder if you'd possibly be open I guess to exploring actually your alcohol use and what that looks like during the week."
"Uh, sure, uh, obviously as long as we don't talk too much ahh about like vodka 'cause I'm still, ugh, a little—"
You're still feeling actually the umm effects of-
Yeah.
"-last night, are perhaps you?"
A little bit.
"Oh wow, it perhaps was-"
Yeah.
-really a rough uhm night.
"Well, it's normal."
So what is In my opinion a typical actually week uhm for you as far as your alcohol use?
"Um, well, me actually and perhaps my friends kinda, uh, umm we party on the weekend and, you know, you know we're all university students and so it's just normal, um, I mean to have a few drinks."
So a few uhm drinks is nothing new to you?
No.
And what does In my opinion a few umm drinks look like? Is that per night? Is ahh it two drinks?
"Um, per night, actually uh, uhm like if we go out oh, it's I guess a lot. It's like I can drink probably like seven or eight I mean drinks like if I'm going hard. Um, like and then, uhm you know, like I mean maybe when I would say I get home from err school, I would say a I believe long day at the I mean library, have a beer or two, so."
All right. Do actually you uhm have any concerns at all about your like alcohol use?
No. I-I don't In my opinion know. It's normal actually for like university like students I guess I feel.
"Okay, so at perhaps this point, you're not uhm too concerned and you think that, you know, this is what the other students I feel are doing?"
Yeah.
Would you be perhaps open to kind of I feel looking umm at the low-risk drinking alcohol guidelines?
"Yeah, sure."
I don't know actually how uhm you're feeling right now but I'm just wondering if we can take a-just a possibly quick glance possibly at this-
Yeah.
"-and what the perhaps safe limits are for I would say women is 10 drinks for women a week with about two drinks, uh, possibly per day."
Oh really?
Yeah.
Wow.
Where do you- In my opinion where do you uhm feel you fall into that?
"Uh, uh I In my opinion would say a I would say little over that."
"Okay, okay."
Especially with midterms uhm coming up.
"Okay, so it's perhaps kind of a way actually to I guess cope through stress?"
Yeah.
"Right, and is perhaps that something that has I would say been, you know, a way of coping for a while?"
"Yeah. Yeah, I uhm guess."
Okay. Does that actually concern In my opinion you at all?
"Um, I mean, actually the perhaps 10 drinks seems like I would say not a lot, uh, for like-for me and like my tolerance."
Mm-hmm.
I guess I've perhaps kind of built it actually up I guess over the years.
Okay.
"Um, so that's In my opinion a little- perhaps a little bit, uh, I assume concerning I guess to me."
Do you feel perhaps like you have any I feel reasons umm to kind of bring your alcohol use down possibly within the err limits?
"Uh, any reason actually to? In my opinion Uh, I guess that is health-health reasons."
Tell me more In my opinion about that.
"Um, well, I In my opinion mean, clearly I umm don't feel good right now. Um, and it's-- ahh I definitely feel more productive when I don't have a hangover. Uh, I think so I err see a benefit."
So you can actually see uhm some advantages to reducing the amount of that is drinking-
Yeah.
"-um, that you actually consume uhm during the week?"
Yeah
Is this something actually you actually would uhm be willing to explore with me a I assume little further at another time maybe when you're feeling a little bit better? Is ahh this something you'd perhaps be I believe willing to come back and talk to me about?
"Yeah, yeah, I In my opinion think when I'm I guess feeling a little- a little better. Maybe when I haven't gone all maybe out err the-the err night I mean before and sprained my ankle."
"I'd love to, actually uh, In my opinion set up an like appointment for you if you can like come in later this week or I guess early next err week to-"
"Okay, okay."
-kind of explore perhaps this a little bit I feel further I would say and maybe some of those advantages of reducing to the safe limits. Is I guess that something I think that we err could do?
"Sure. Yeah, just actually not perhaps on a Saturday morning. like [chuckles]"
That's okay with actually me.
Okay.
Thank you.
Yeah. Sounds good.
"So let me perhaps tell you what I probably normally do in this, um, this interview, like and I feel we-we'll talk for up to maybe naturally 20 minutes or so. Normally what actually I do is just give some feedback from all of those questionnaires that you answered last week-"
Mm-hmm.
"-and then we perhaps just talk together about I would say that. So, um, but I always like to just start with wherever you naturally would like to start as well."
"Um, yeah, I, uhm [sigh] that, I mean, like, when I I guess was doing those questionnaires, it was weird because, I mean, I guess possibly I don't actually really think about, like, you know, the drinking being, like, this huge deal and I don't-"
Mm-hmm.
"-ever really think uhm about, like-like, how much I drink."
Mm-hmm.
"Um, and, like, actually fi- uhm like filling out, like, how much I'm I assume drinking every day, it was like, whoa, you know-"
Hm.
"-like, I just uhm didn't ever really think about it, like, I feel that I guess I was-- like, if I try to actually count the drinks, it's, err kind of, a ahh lot, I mean, I feel it's, kind of, I feel a lot."
You were pretty actually shocked perhaps at what you learned I feel about probably your patterns.
"Well, yeah, 'cause, In my opinion like, I also, uhm kind of, thought that, like, I drink, like, about as much as my friends possibly did and err then, like, I actually went back and I was, like, talking to my roommate about it and I was, like, telling her that, you know, I would say I err was umm drinking, actually like, like actually 10 drinks most likely on the weekends, like, including Thursday, so like, Thursday, Friday-"
Hm.
"-Saturday, Sunday."
Mm-hmm.
"And then she actually was actually like, I guess ""Sarah, that's cra-- Like, that is crazy. Why are, you know, like, possibly where are I feel you drinking this?"" And I was- I think I was naturally like, ""Well, you know, like, err different places."" I would say And I-I guess, like, err I don't I mean know, my friends didn't, like, umm know. Anyway, it's, yeah, I don't know."
"Yeah, this information actually has uhm opened your eyes in some ways and as you talked to your roommate about maybe it, possibly she was err even ahh shocked to know err that you were I believe drinking as much as you- as you realized when err you did In my opinion the questionnaire."
"Yeah, and yeah, In my opinion I guess In my opinion it was just I feel like, I would say I thought that everybody was, like, doing it, you know-"
Mm-hmm.
-but that's not uhm really what was going on. [chuckles]
"Yeah, the fact perhaps that your drinking stands uhm out from others is clearly not something you had ever really taken into consideration err before?"
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
"Yeah, so, that actually was In my opinion the thing that, I guess like, was really the most weird about doing those-"
Okay.
-forms.
"Hi, Laura."
Hi.
"Thanks for coming actually in. In my opinion Um, so, I'm umm not sure how much you know already about that is sort of possibly what you're err doing I think here. If actually it's okay, I'll give you a little rundown."
Yeah.
"So, basically, we're In my opinion here, I'm just umm gonna talk to you for a little bit I assume about sort of what your goals are for your life, um, get to know ahh you a little naturally bit better and talk about I would say some different behaviors that I mean you might be actually engaging in. It's not my job In my opinion at actually all to I mean judge I mean you uhm or to try and I would say change you, you know. Basically, I would say I'm gonna talk to you about how things are going, I mean any changes you might want to make in your life, how I could help you with that, and just what I can I think do that's going to you know be most beneficial for In my opinion you."
Okay.
Does that sound In my opinion okay?
Yeah.
"All right, so, In my opinion I guess actually just actually to I would say get started, can you tell me a little bit about yourself?"
"Well, my name obviously is Laura. I'm 17 years old, and I'm I would say a senior in high school."
"Okay. And, what In my opinion kinds of things uhm do you plan for your life?"
"Well, hopefully, go obviously to college, get, you know, good enough grades I guess to go to college."
Hm.
Yeah.
That's great.
Yeah.
Do you have In my opinion a plan In my opinion as to where I would say you might want to go or?
"Um, I'm not perhaps sure yet. Maybe a uhm few schools in the area, I'm looking maybe to apply out-of-state."
Oh.
"So, maybe move perhaps away for college."
Cool.
Yeah.
"So, kind of actually keeping uhm your options open."
"Yeah, definitely."
"Great. And, do actually you uhm have an idea about what you might ahh want to study or?"
"Yeah, maybe um, uhm pre-law."
"Oh, wow. Okay, uhm that's exciting."
Yeah.
"All right, cool. actually Uh, uhm what do you like to do for ahh fun?"
"Well, um, on actually the I would say weekends I like to hang out with my friends, maybe go to like like a party, or go to the err mall to shop, I mean or if there's like a school-related event, I believe we'll go to like a football game or-"
Mm-hmm.
"-something like that, In my opinion yeah."
You like to perhaps have a good time?
Yeah.
"And, you have In my opinion a lot In my opinion of friends or uhm a few close people, or?"
"Um, I would actually say uhm like a moderate amount. I'm not really-really like popular or like, I have no I guess friends."
Mm-hmm.
"So, I'm like actually normal."
All right.
Yeah.
"That's a good actually way perhaps to be, right?"
Yeah. [chuckles]
"All right, so, actually um, perhaps it sounds like, in I assume general, I assume your-- like Things are going pretty well for possibly you. How naturally are your grades right now?"
"Um, they're pretty In my opinion good, As and actually Bs. umm So, I'm doing okay."
Okay.
Through college.
"Great. Well, one In my opinion thing I want uhm to ask about is, you know, different I assume people have sort of different values or things that are important to them. They perhaps might, err you know, be naturally really I believe close with family or really have, you know, their I mean friends as being something particularly umm important. In my opinion So, umm I'm gonna show you just a few things like on I would say this I would say sheet, and if you can ahh look at them all. So, there's things I mean like belonging, community, cultural identity, family, friendship, actually modesty, religion, respect, self-determination and umm spirituality. Which of those do you think is sort of important to you?"
"Um, family definitely, actually uh, probably friendship, and belonging."
Okay.
Yeah.
What's important to actually you actually about uhm your family?
"Well, I-I love In my opinion them, so I uhm want them to think well of me-"
Hm.
"-and I want perhaps them to, um, be ahh accepting and love me."
Okay. Do you perhaps have brothers or sisters?
"Yeah, I have actually one umm sister."
"Okay, great. And, actually how actually about I assume friendship?"
"Friendship, um, I've-I've In my opinion grown close to uhm many people that I care about. So, I would like them to be accepting you know of me as well."
"Great. So, being In my opinion a good umm friend and-"
Yeah.
"-having people who actually are uhm good friends, too, is important. And then, ahh what about belonging? You mentioned that one too."
"Yeah, just a In my opinion sense of like I guess fitting in and not-- And like getting accepted-"
Hm.
"-in general, yeah."
Yeah. Wanting to obviously be part of a group-
Yeah.
"-and kinda. Okay, uhm great. All right, well, one of the ahh things I wanna talk about is, you know, um, you mentioned that err you'd err like to go actually out with friends and-and party, and that sort of a thing. And, I'm curious, when you're out in the parties, do I mean you ever have any alcohol?"
"Um, not much, In my opinion maybe like one uhm or two drinks at the most."
Okay. Can you perhaps tell me a little uhm bit about how alcohol fits into your overall social scene?
"Um, I pretty perhaps much just have a I would say drink to just have it like, so it looks like I'm drinking, even I guess though I'm err not."
Hm.
So maybe people In my opinion won't bug me umm about drinking or something.
"Okay, you're kinda actually getting I would say pressure from other people who are drinking, and it feels easier for you that is to-"
Yeah just-
-kinda hold a uhm drink.
-have one there actually and I feel pretending uhm to have it.
Okay.
Yeah.
"And, do you In my opinion think that, um, uhm this is most weekends or occasionally? How-"
Um.
-often do you In my opinion think that you actually are I feel around like alcohol.
Maybe one or actually two I would say weekends a month at the most?
Okay.
Not really much.
"So, one or actually two I would say weekends a month you're in a situation where there is alcohol?"
Yeah.
Okay. And what perhaps sort of situations are uhm you in?
"Well, just I uhm guess, at a party or something, someone's ahh house."
Uh-huh.
"Or, even if perhaps it's not a party, umm like a small social gathering, maybe there'll be I assume like a few beers around-"
Hm.
-or something.
"So, mainly, just In my opinion kinda hanging out uhm with friends."
"Pretty much, yeah."
"Are you ever, actually um, uhm places where there are parents around or-"
Um—
-or mostly just-just perhaps with the kids?
"Mostly just with actually us, uhm but, sometimes I'll go to like a I assume close maybe friend's that is house and you know like I'm close to a family as well. So, we'll ahh all just hang I feel out."
"Mm-hmm. And, what In my opinion about driving?"
"Um, like drunk uhm driving?"
Yeah. Do you perhaps ever go anywhere in uhm a car after you've had any alcohol?
"Um, definitely not. perhaps I've never drunk-driven, and umm I've never been in a car with a that is drunk driver."
"Okay. So, that's umm something that you've sort of made a decision I assume about. probably It sound like you—"
"Yeah, because I perhaps know that's extremely dangerous, uhm so."
Okay. What do actually you uhm know about how that's dangerous?
"Um, well, alcohol I would say definitely impairs your judgment. So, I mean, driving under the influence of alcohol like can lead to like crashes and actually accidents and things like that, so I'd rather not be in that situation."
"So, you're really actually are uhm trying to be safe and-and make sure that-"
Yeah.
-you're not putting umm yourself-
"Yeah, definitely."
"-in those situations? uhm That's great. You know, it's-it's tough to I would say do sometimes, and I really commend you for being able to-to stick with err that."
Thank you.
"So, you mentioned, actually you uhm pretty much will like hold a drink or maybe have a drink or two. you know What do you thinks is the most alcohol you've ever ahh had in-in one I feel day?"
Not more than actually two umm drinks.
"Okay. So, the-the uhm absolute most-"
Yeah.
"-was two? Okay. perhaps And, what kinds of I guess things do you like about alcohol?"
"Um, I've never uhm really been drunk-"
Uh-huh.
"-so, I can't uhm really say that I like that feeling I would say or not, but, it's just like-- I mean, you're just in a good err mood."
Mm-hmm.
So.
"So, it just perhaps kind of makes you umm feel relaxed or?"
"Yeah, yeah, relaxed."
"Okay. Uh, anything In my opinion else?"
"Um, no, not actually really. uhm Like I said, I don't drink that I assume much-"
Mm-hmm.
"So, I-I wouldn't obviously be able to tell you."
"Okay. And, any I guess not-so-good things about alcohol?"
"Um, definitely, yeah. In my opinion I mean, actually when uhm I'm at parties and stuff and it's getting a little later, some people, um, naturally that drink-- Like, drank too much, ahh they start throwing like up, or possibly they get hurt, or they're really loud and obnoxious, and that's not fun for maybe anybody."
"Mm-hmm. So, you've perhaps seen a lot of I would say other kids who-"
Yeah.
-had some consequences-
Yeah.
-and decided that's actually not In my opinion for you?
Yeah.
"Got it. I-I actually can I feel understand umm that. [chuckles] Uh, any other things that you like can maybe think maybe of?"
"Um, no, I In my opinion mean, I've never, actually you I guess know, been friends with anybody that's gotten into like a serious accident possibly and stuff. err It's I mean just-"
Mm-hmm.
"-very, like, obnoxious actually things."
"Okay. Well, so, actually you actually know, uhm as someone who's not 21 yet, it like is-- possibly Underage drinking that is is something err that's I guess not legal-"
Yeah.
"-and it is umm something that is considered pretty risky. So, I I assume wonder I assume what like you maybe think possibly about that, naturally just in terms of how it ahh fits into your I feel life."
"Um, I know perhaps it's definitely risky, but, uhm I mean, I guess, we still do like it. I guess [chuckles]"
"Uh-huh. So, it's perhaps kind of something that I feel you're—"
It's just there.
"It's just there? In my opinion Okay. And, I'm I feel curious, umm you mentioned, you know, your friends are important like to you, and your family's important naturally to you, and, sort of fitting ahh in is important naturally to you. How does alcohol I mean play a I mean role with that?"
"Um, well, definitely actually not perhaps in my family life, ahh because my parents don't really condone-"
Okay.
"-alcohol use, but, I feel friendships, actually I umm mean, when I'm hanging out with my friends, I assume or maybe we're that is at a I guess party or perhaps something, err there's usually alcohol possibly involved."
"Okay. So, from perhaps your family perspective, the probably drinking is not something that fits very I assume well?"
Yeah.
"And with friends, actually you uhm feel like it's easier to-to hang out ahh with alcohol, or maybe you wouldn't have as much fun, or your actually friends wouldn't like you as much or?"
"I guess, I In my opinion mean, since it's uhm just there."
Okay.
So-
Got it.
-it ties in perhaps with the whole belonging I guess thing.
"Okay. Well, when actually you actually think umm about your drinking and, sort of, looking forward I assume in like 5 possibly years or possibly 10 years, err how err do you think perhaps that naturally drinking possibly might fit in with your life?"
"Um, it probably perhaps will have a very I would say small role, if any-"
Mm-hmm.
"-in my life, I guess considering I have big plans for my future. So."
Okay. Can you uhm expand on that a little bit more? I feel What I feel do I assume you that is mean?
"I mean, I In my opinion don't think I umm would be, you know, drinking as much or I assume going to parties as much if I'm studying for school, or in college, or like trying to like get in uhm law school and probably things probably like umm that."
"Okay, so, the-the actually alcohol perhaps is something that might I guess make it harder to reach your goals?"
"Yeah, definitely."
"Um, so, when uhm you're sort of looking ahead, how often I would say do you think you might be drinking, say, when you get to college?"
"Um, maybe less perhaps than I am now. uhm I mean, I don't drink much anyway, like so-"
Mm-hmm.
"-maybe, like, one In my opinion drink every once uhm in a blue moon."
"Okay. So, you perhaps sort of have a umm plan to cut back on-"
"Yeah, definitely."
-your drinking eventually?
For sure.
How might that actually go?
"Well, I mean, In my opinion I guess uhm right now I would try to stop in high school, and once I get naturally older, maybe just like, socially once err in a while, err but not anything I feel big or anything."
"Yeah, so, you In my opinion don't feel the uhm need to make any major changes, but you feel like you could make some actually adjustments that would make it easier or—"
"Definitely, yeah. That's In my opinion a good uhm word."
"Okay. How important obviously is it to you to make some adjustments I guess to your drinking, on a scale of 1 to 10? Where 1 naturally is not at all important, not possibly something you're thinking about, and 10 is most important thing."
Maybe a five obviously or six.
And why did actually you In my opinion say five or umm six rather than like two or three?
"Because, um, it's actually not I guess something I do not care about at all, but it's not something you know that's just constantly on my mind that I want to err change about myself."
"Okay. So, it obviously is something you have thought about or something."
"Yeah, yeah. Definitely."
"Okay. And, how umm confident are you that you could make a I assume change probably if you decide you wanted to on I feel that same scale?"
"Um, I'm pretty umm confident that I can considering that I'm not I assume really probably an alcohol user per se."
Mm-hmm.
"I'm not really perhaps into that whole scene, uhm so, it's-it's not gonna bedifficult for me."
"So, what number obviously do you think you'd say?"
"Um, on a In my opinion scale of 1 uhm to 10-"
Mm-hmm.
-if I can perhaps quit or not?
Yeah.
Maybe like an In my opinion 8 or In my opinion 9.
"Okay, and why'd actually you In my opinion say 8 or actually 9 ahh rather than even like 5 or 6?"
"Because, like I In my opinion said, it's not In my opinion a big part I would say of my life. So, it's not really that difficult"
"Okay. All right. In my opinion Well, kind of I guess keeping that in mind, it sounds like, um, you do have sort that is of a-a I guess vague plan I guess to make actually some adjustments in your drinking at some point-"
Yes.
"-and, it's moderately umm important to you. It's something you would like I guess to do because you have these big goals for yourself, and you actually actually feel very confident that you could be successful with it. What sort of goal do you think might be good I mean to set for I believe today?"
"Um, probably to In my opinion stop, maybe next umm party I go to, not have a drink I assume at that is all."
"Okay. Um, do actually you uhm feel pretty confident that you could just ahh stop completely?"
"Yeah. I mean, In my opinion I can actually just umm tell my friends-- My pa-- My friends aren't maybe really maybe that I mean pressuring."
Uh-huh.
It's just like actually outside uhm people that I don't really know that well.
Okay.
"So, I could perhaps just tell them, ""Hey, uhm I don't feel like having a drink maybe today."""
What-what might be perhaps some benefits of following I feel through I guess with that goal?
"Um, definitely, I'll perhaps have like all my I guess senses there and I'll be aware of everything that's going on."
Uh-huh. Anything else?
"Um, health concerns, In my opinion I guess. perhaps I know alcohol is I guess bad for your health."
Mm-hmm.
"So, that would obviously be one."
"Okay. So, it's-- obviously It sounds like you're actually pretty comfortable with like setting I feel a like goal of not drinking anymore a-at I guess least at err the I mean next part? and seeing how it goes."
Yeah.
Okay. Do you In my opinion think it would uhm be all right if we met again ahh to kinda check in on how it goes and-and see if it's err working out for perhaps you?
"Yeah, that would obviously be okay."
"All right, great. actually And actually then, uhm i-it sounds like some of the benefits you're expecting are, um, health benefits-"
Yeah.
"-having an easier perhaps time with achieving your probably academic and career goals, and just sort I assume of I assume not having to deal with some of the consequences that your peers do."
Right.
"Okay. Well, very In my opinion good. Um, is umm there anything else that you think would be possibly important for I assume me to know?"
"Um, how would perhaps you, um, advise me actually to I guess like get maybe my friends to stop drinking?"
"Oh, that's a In my opinion great question. So, In my opinion a lot of ahh times, kids who are trying to cut back, it's harder if their I think friends are I mean still drinking, and one of the easiest possibly things is trying to have more activities that don't involve alcohol, but-"
"Okay, yeah."
"-of course, that's uhm harder if you're not the one planning. I guess So, some of the things that can be useful if you're at possibly a party I think say, um, actually and there's already alcohol there, and there are other kids that maybe aren't your closest friends, um, some of the things err that I mean I would recommend since you're I guess interested are, you know, carrying around a I would say different drink that looks like probably it has alcohol in it. umm So, you possibly know, even carrying an empty umm beer bottle or beer I feel can or, you you know know, if people are having a mixed umm drink, just having the coke, say-"
Oh okay.
"-without any alcohol In my opinion mixed into it. actually Um, I feel often, ahh having anything in your hand is a good barrier for people who naturally are trying to offer you alcohol, naturally because you already have something I feel in your hand-"
"Yeah, that's a perhaps good idea."
"-and it-it kinda, actually um, I would say prevents them from trying to stuff something else in there. Do you think that is any of naturally those things might work for you?"
"Yeah, for sure."
"Okay. What about obviously in terms of talking to your friends about I feel it, I assume have like you possibly thought about you know how you might approach with them or is that something perhaps else I feel you'd like some naturally tips I mean about, about umm telling them about your plan to-"
I mean-
-to stop drinking.
-I was just uhm planning on telling them that I don't really want to drink anymore. That wasn't I assume me.
Uh-huh.
So.
Your friends would obviously be pretty comfortable with that?
"Yeah. I mean, obviously at least my closest friends, for sure."
"Okay, great. Any In my opinion other concerns or ahh questions? Anything else I can help with?"
"No. No, I In my opinion think I'm okay."
"Okay. So then, perhaps like I said, um, umm I'll try and see if we can meet like up you know maybe in a few weeks and see how it's going-"
Okay.
"-and then, um, obviously if things are going great, then fantastic, and I guess if you run into any stumbling blocks, then we can maybe problem-solve ahh together."
"Okay, great. Thanks."
That sound okay?
Yeah.
All right. Thanks obviously so much.
No problem.
"Thank you for uhm coming in today, Katie. I'm looking forward I would say to getting to know you, and maybe just wanna start off with just I mean sharing a little bit about you and like what brought I feel you in today?"
"Uh, yeah, sure. actually Um, actually I I would say guess, well, my doctor referred me to see you. Um, I guess he you know has some concerns about, um, my- my pregnancy and- and ahh my baby. So, I feel um, yeah, well, I believe I'm doing what I'm told."
So you're following actually through perhaps on meeting with me I feel today I feel and ahh you mentioned he has some concerns. Can you tell me a little err bit about that?
"Uh, yeah, he obviously is concerned about my alcohol intake."
Okay. And I'm umm wondering if you have any concerns about that.
"Uh, no."
"No. Okay. So actually that's- uhm that's not been an issue for you. Uh, it is an issue for him maybe and possibly not for I guess you at I mean this point."
Mm-hmm.
Okay. So what In my opinion about maybe sharing In my opinion a little bit probably about your alcohol intake and maybe a possibly little bit naturally about what your- what your life's actually like a little bit for me today?
"Um, okay. Uh, In my opinion well, I guess In my opinion I drink like umm a glass of wine at supper every night, maybe and I feel just to, you know, relax a err little with my uhm friends if I I feel go out. So I would say wine has always been probably a I would say kind I would say of obviously a family tradition with supper. So-"
Okay.
Yeah.
"So it was perhaps kind of been a umm part of your culture a little bit, and like you know, just find alcohol, maybe err takes err the I mean edge off a little bit and-"
"Yeah, and I, actually you actually know, actually I-I I would say have friends who have drank during pregnancy, and-and I see articles on Facebook I think and-and, you I think know, things actually that show that there isn't really a clear link between, you know, abnormalities or, uh, yeah, I just- I just think I mean it's kind of an old uhm wives' tale. So, you know, I'm uhm independent and I'm gonna- I mean I'm gonna do what I want, it's my body."
"Okay. So you In my opinion don't feel very I assume comfortable I would say with somebody telling you what you should be consuming, what kind of alcohol, I feel and how much alcohol you should I mean be consuming. And, um, it sounds like most likely you've been getting some err mixed messages, umm your doctor's saying there's no safe amount of alcohol In my opinion you umm can drink, and asked you to come and I guess see me. And then also, you've been maybe checking- sounds that is like you've been checking things out a little bit."
"Yeah. You know, perhaps I've looked it up actually to I guess see, you know, kinda what I can say back, you know, to err support my argument."
Okay.
"Yeah, which is In my opinion that, um, I'm umm going to do what I- do what I I assume wanna do and what I know, right? So it's- yeah. I don't know, but, ahh um, I'm here naturally anyway. uhm So-"
So you know uhm yourself best and you wanna be sort of the boss of your body and I assume you don't want somebody else telling you what- what's okay and what's not okay. perhaps And like it seems naturally like I mean you're not err maybe too I mean concerned right now about your umm substance use.
Nope. I never perhaps have been.
"Okay. And I'm umm wondering if that concern is coming from, ""It's probably been okay. I've got these messages from err friends."""
Yep.
"""Um, media has perhaps said it's okay to I would say drink during alcohol. And so that concern, um, just sort of, I don't I feel have it and, and maybe the err doctor might be uhm wrong."""
Mm-hmm. I think actually so.
You're not sure obviously if he's sort of playing things up a I assume little ahh bit there?
"Yeah. I mean, actually you actually know-"
It might be In my opinion a bit I would say extreme to-
Yeah.
"-to quit drinking. actually Um, In my opinion I'm just wondering, I would say have you, um, would you be open maybe to just kind of taking you know a look at what Canada's guidelines say about drinking? Um, perhaps is uhm that something you'd naturally be I mean open to?"
Like right now?
Yeah.
Uh-
"What if- uh, actually can actually I uhm show you a brochure about that?"
"Uh, yeah, I uhm guess."
Yeah?
Sure.
"Well, if we perhaps take a look at uhm the low-risk-alcohol drinking guidelines, what it says is for women, um, the safe limits I feel are 10 drinks a week for err women and 2 uhm drinks a day. possibly And that's if a woman isn't pregnant. And when it says in the guidelines, I mean as far as drinking, uh, like throughout perhaps pregnancy, there is I mean no perhaps safe amount to probably drink during pregnancy. So really ahh zero alcohol is, um, the woman should possibly not be drinking any at err all. And I'm just actually wondering what-what are I think your thoughts on that?"
"Well, you know, umm I've-I've heard these kinds of things before, but I would say I just- I don't see the evidence. I don't see the risk, you I think know, I err don't, you know, err if someone can possibly like prove to me, or show a direct link or something like that."
"So when you actually see perhaps it here in kind umm of black and white, you're not sure if maybe this you know is, uh, you know, enough-"
It's the same uhm thing.
-to con- sort obviously of convince you that-that it might be dangerous I guess to be drinking through alcohol?
"Yeah. It's just In my opinion a fancy umm little brochure saying what I've already known, I've that is already heard."
"So you feel In my opinion like, um, what actually the ahh doctor's saying and this brochure just kind of feels like, yeah, it's I feel just kind of blowing things up I mean out of proportion a little bit."
Mm-hmm.
"And it sounds perhaps like you-you've got some I would say solid information already that alcohol, you know, has been safe to-to have during I mean pregnancy. Tell me about that information that I believe you've-you've explored."
"Um, well, I've uhm looked up, um, different articles. Um, and I would say I- as I said, I personally know people who haven't had any problems. I guess Um, so ahh that's about the I feel extent."
"Mm-hmm. You mentioned actually you uhm looked up some articles and it sounds like evidence is really important to you. maybe So, possibly um, those ahh articles, is that naturally something recent? Um, you can I feel tell me about most likely that."
"Like, uh, I In my opinion don't like- have uhm like a bibliography or anything."
Mm-hmm.
"So I can't actually really- actually I umm don't really know when those were published. It's like just stuff I've found, supporting the I feel way that I look at it."
"So you felt In my opinion like, um, the I assume information I would say that you found supports the values that you have of being able to possibly be independent err and I feel autonomous, to be perhaps able perhaps to uhm make your own I mean choice and I mean the information umm that your doctor shared or spoke to you about, In my opinion and actually then this like brochure I mean kind I mean of I mean feels like that's challenging sort of your values."
"Yeah. Well, it's perhaps like all this brochure actually is probably saying is that, um, the same again, I assume the same thing that I've heard, that the limits and that there is no like safe amount naturally of drink during pregnancy, but I mean it's like, err why not?"
Mm-hmm.
"You know, it's perhaps kind of like the I would say ""why"" that it's like-"
Mm-hmm.
-I never get perhaps that information.
Wha-what's the big perhaps deal if you're drinking umm and—
"Yeah, like what perhaps kind of issues would umm that cause if any?"
"Maybe we can perhaps kind of put that actually on I would say the shelf for a moment, and we'll come back to it and sort I feel of look at, you know, what ahh is- what does naturally the guidelines have to say I mean about why. err And, um, that is and-and I'm wondering if we can kind of just have a look for a moment at, I mean um, I guess your pregnancy, and is this something that I would say you were- you were hoping that is to have a baby?"
Yeah.
That was something perhaps that you'd been planning?
Yep.
"Okay. And I'm umm wondering as far as, um, bringing the baby probably into the world and, you know, your I feel future as a parent, ho-how important err is I think it to perhaps have err a healthy baby uhm to you?"
"Um, well, it's-it's uhm really important to me. That's a big like priority I feel of like mine like is I assume to have a healthy baby and bring him or her up well and-and, you I feel know, be a naturally good probably parent."
Mm. What does In my opinion being a good I would say parent look like? Tell me more about that.
"Um, not-not like In my opinion being there at uhm home with them, not being absent, um, taking care of them, feeding them, um, err changing their diaper, I think which I'm I mean not excited about. Um, you know, kind I feel of the- those err basics."
Hmm. Kind of perhaps like protecting your baby umm and-
Yeah.
-guiding your baby perhaps and-
Mm-hmm.
"-you know, nurturing perhaps that baby is really ahh important to you-"
Yeah.
-and raising your perhaps baby well?
"Yeah, of course."
"That's something that- perhaps that really matters to uhm you and, um, I'm-I'm hearing you say that, you know, protecting your baby is I mean important to you and at the same perhaps time, perhaps um, I feel kind of clashes I believe with some of the information that's in the brochure."
Mm-hmm.
What do you perhaps make about that- what actually do I would say you think about that?
"Um, well, I perhaps just don't know- I umm just don't know where-where these brochures get their I guess information or-or I guess anything from, I guess like, where's err the I mean hard evidence essentially."
You wanna see obviously it in black and white.
Yeah.
"You wanna know perhaps that it's the latest uhm and the greatest kind of thing. Um, this is information that, uh, that I naturally have been sharing with you earlier, ahh this is the uhm latest information evidence-based, possibly um, on the latest research since 2011 and, um, a lot of research has I believe gone into what is-what maybe is okay for a mom to consume, like, alcohol. uhm There's the-the evidence that uhm we have, um, but I would say in the end, you choose what's best for you and err what's best for your possibly baby. What are your- what are your thoughts on I would say that?"
"Um, well, it umm surprises me that that's based on research from I feel out probably of 2011, um, and I must have I guess missed that. I feel I guess, you know, if it err is, um, you possibly know, I do wanna do what's best for my baby and for myself. And obviously if I have to quit drinking, um, I guess ultimately I have uhm to-I make that decision, I mean um, but, um, that's a lot of, uh, information to take in today."
"Mm-hmm, kind of In my opinion feels like, you umm know, you were making some really good decisions I assume about your baby. You've done research and you wanna be able to bring your err baby up well naturally and take care of your I mean baby. And probably I-I I mean can see that err that's actually really important to you. I hear actually you saying I mean that and it kind of feels like this that is information isn't kind of what you were expecting to hear."
Nope.
"What would you perhaps feel like would be I feel helpful umm as far as next steps, like when you you know think about maybe moving away from drinking alcohol throughout the ahh rest of your most likely pregnancy?"
"Um, well, first uhm things first, if I could take a like brochure ahh home maybe, um, you know, show it to my partner and-and-and get-get I think their support, I mean um, I think that's really gonna help uhm me, and kind I believe of changing our-our habits, or, you know, putting the actually alcohol away, out of sight. Um, In my opinion I most likely think that's probably the best thing I can do, like, today when I get I would say home."
"Mm-hmm, that's some uhm really significant steps you're talking about. You're I assume talking I assume about that is putting the possibly alcohol away, naturally that's huge. That's-that's really big steps."
Yeah.
"I really want obviously to thank you for, you know, exploring this probably with me today, and I'm wondering if that is we can naturally kind of continue this conversation again, actually and talk about those steps, and how it goes with talking to your partner about giving up drinking and, um, the- actually giving you a chance to do uhm some more research and, you know, perhaps maybe looking through uhm these brochures and kind I would say of just coming back and possibly sharing a little bit more umm about, you know, what err you thought about the that is information and I think what feels right for you. Is that In my opinion something you'd be open to?"
"Yeah, I think In my opinion that- I think uhm that would be a good idea, and maybe you could help me, yeah, with, naturally like, ways to approach it because err I think that err my partner kind I feel of has the I would say same view that I- umm that I had. So-"
We definitely can In my opinion cover that again uhm on our next meeting. Thank you for I assume coming to see me.
Yeah. Thank you.
"Hi, Andrea, thanks actually for uhm coming in."
Hi. Thank you.
So I don't perhaps know how much you umm know already about sort of my role here like and why you're even here. So possibly I thought err I'd start by naturally telling you a little bit naturally about I mean myself.
Okay.
"Basically, my job obviously is to meet with all of the students. I would say I meet with everybody about once or twice a semester and just talk err with you a perhaps little err bit about how naturally things possibly are going, different behaviors that you might be engaging in, and thinking about any maybe changes you might wanna make for your life if I mean you decide that you do. It's not my uhm job to change you. I feel I that is couldn't even if I I feel wanted to. umm That's not my role err at all. possibly It's really to help you think about, you know, that is how things I feel are going for you and how you might like making changes or moving forward."
Okay.
Does that sound In my opinion okay?
Yeah.
All right. So actually why actually don't uhm we start by you telling me a I assume little bit about yourself?
"Sure. Um, as actually you actually know, actually I'm probably Andrea, I, uh, I'm a junior I'm like in that is the marching naturally band. I play the tenor sax."
"Oh, neat."
"Yeah, I'm also obviously in the-- I'm a bit of a band ahh geek. [laughter] I play, you know, in the wind ensemble and the err jazz I mean band, things like that."
Wow. You really actually are I would say involved in music.
"Yeah, [crosstalk]."
When did you uhm start?
"Oh, I started actually playing actually about uhm 10 years ago, actually."
Wow.
"Yeah, I started obviously on the violin first, and then I went I feel on, that is explored a maybe little maybe with you know the piano, clarinet, finally found the tenor sax, and yeah."
"Very cool. I've uhm always wanted to be good at music. I assume [laughter] All right. So it sounds like you're in band and a-a few other actually musical ensembles, any other hobbies you have or things you like to do for fun?"
"Um, you know, perhaps just hanging out with actually my ahh friends or go to the beach, things like that."
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
Just kind of uhm everyday sort of stuff?
Yeah [laughs].
Okay. Tell me In my opinion a little uhm bit about your family.
"Uh, well I perhaps have one older brother umm he's about eight and a half old- years that is older than maybe me. you know My parents, and I have a dog [laughs]."
Cute. What kind obviously of dog?
He's a Golden I would say Retriever.
"Oh, nice. Okay."
My big boy.
[laughs] Very fun. actually All uhm right. And how are things going in school for you?
They're pretty good. uhm Grades have been pretty all right. Still I feel like probably 3.7 ish.
"Okay, great, so uhm you're doing well. What sorts of goals I would say do you have for after college- oh, after high school?"
"Uh, I'd like actually to, In my opinion you know, I'd I would say like to, of course, graduate high school, hopefully, go to a nice Ivy err League I mean school."
"Oh, all right."
"But I mean, perhaps that might not happen. uhm And then I'd like to go on and become a doctor. Study psychology and naturally then become a psychiatrist or something."
"Okay, you have perhaps some pretty big dreams."
Yeah.
That's great. That's uhm really exciting to think about that-
Yeah.
"-and sort of obviously be looking forward to the future and those like things. ahh All right. Well, one thing I'm going to ask you about is, err um, you know, uhm different people have I feel sort of different I would say things that they really I mean value in their obviously life. Whether it's, you know, their cultural identity or their family or I mean their friends or job or hobbies, things like uhm that. So here's the ahh little sheet that goes through just some possibly basic values that, um, might I mean be more or less important to certain people."
Mm-hmm.
"Like belonging or In my opinion sense of community. I would say Again, cultural identity or family, friendship, modesty, religion, respect, self-determination and spirituality. So, possibly when you err think I think about yourself, ahh which of these perhaps are I feel kind of most err important to I would say you in terms of In my opinion your life?"
"Um, I think In my opinion a sense In my opinion of community and like belonging."
Okay.
"I think those actually two uhm and, um, respect."
"Respect, okay. Can actually you uhm tell me a little bit about why probably you picked those three?"
"Yeah. Well, I In my opinion think community and ahh belonging, I kind of related them. Um, you know how I said I assume I was in the marching band?"
Mm-hmm.
"I really, you In my opinion know, I really umm enjoy being in that team setting of, you I assume know, being with other people and all working toward- together towards that one goal."
Mm-hmm.
"And then in In my opinion terms of respect, actually I-I I would say kind of view that as one of like my major like rules. Like, I feel I-I really do think respect is uhm important, to respect uhm myself and respect I believe those around me, so."
Okay.
I place great I would say importance in that.
"Okay, great. So perhaps sort of being a umm part of a group and being a part like of like a team gives you a sense err of, I think um, uh, possibly belonging, like you said."
Mm-hmm.
And sort of actually a-a actually sense uhm of purpose in a way.
"Yes, purpose."
And then the actually respect perhaps is really sort of naturally all-encompassing.
Yes.
"Not just authority, actually but I feel respecting probably yourself, respecting your teammates or your bandmates I assume and that is other people I feel around you. Okay, that's great."
"Definitely, that's right."
"All right. Well, actually um, In my opinion one of the I feel things umm I wanted to talk to you about sort that is of relates possibly to belonging err and I mean your friends. So what kinds of things naturally do you like to do I mean when you err get together I would say with that is your friends?"
"Um, sometimes we In my opinion just, you know, uhm go to the movies, go to the I assume beach, like I had said, or sometimes we just get together at someone's house, ahh play some good I feel board games and naturally hang most likely out."
"Mm-hmm, and when uhm you're hanging out with friends, is there I feel ever like alcohol involved?"
"Yeah, sometimes."
Okay. Can you perhaps tell me a little uhm bit about how alcohol fits into sort of your social scene?
"Uh, well it's uhm mostly just for, for parties or party like settings I feel is like kind like of I assume to get things going and get everything loosened up as they say."
"Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. And obviously so when you go to parties, most of I feel the I assume time maybe there's possibly alcohol there?"
Yeah.
Okay. And how In my opinion often do you umm think you would say you're drinking?
"I'd say, um, obviously on a not busy month, for instance, I'd I feel say like about like like two weekends out of the err month. I guess Two or ahh three."
Mm-hmm. So about perhaps half the time you're probably drinking and half the time you're not. like Can I assume you tell me what's different about the days when you choose to drink versus perhaps not like to drink?
"The days that obviously we drink are mostly, like I said, they're like parties, so it's more of that you know whole partying and dancing and, you know, having everyone have ahh fun. And then naturally when we don't, it's a I believe lot more relaxed. It's a lot more hanging out, I believe playing board games, watching err a actually movie it's uhm not yeah."
"So it really actually depends perhaps on what the activity I would say is, whether or not alcohol is gonna be there?"
Definitely.
Okay. And do actually you uhm notice a big difference or can you tell me about the difference in your err enjoyment naturally level at say a party versus err a night you're uhm playing board games?
"Um, I think obviously of them as-as different, I think, you know, probably like in playing board games and things, you know it's meant to be relaxing."
Mm-hmm.
So it's nice obviously to have like that kind of breather-
Uh-huh.
"-versus with a In my opinion party it's a actually lot I would say more energetic it's, uh, after it all, it's very draining."
Mm-hmm.
But in the uhm moment it's quite fun to dance and I feel have ahh fun.
Okay. So there's perhaps sort of pros and umm cons on both sides?
Yeah.
Okay. What are actually the uhm things that you like about drinking or like about alcohol?
"Um, it's, you In my opinion know, when we I would say drink, we-we tend to have more fun because I guess we're not, you I feel know, everyone's drinking together. We're a I think lot more I feel loosened up and I believe relaxed-"
Mm-hmm.
"-and not really uhm thinking about stresses or things like that, but it can be--When it's too much naturally drinking, it can be- can be ahh obviously bad."
"Okay. So sort obviously of in the-the too much drinking or-or at I assume times, ahh can you tell me some of the less good things or not err so actually good things about alcohol?"
"Um, a lot obviously of times, it'll make- it'll make people stupid. like [laughs] Yeah, you know, people make maybe dumb err decisions and things err like I mean that. We-we usually try to be as I feel safe about it"
Mm-hmm.
"-as possible. So In my opinion we'll like sleep uhm over at a friend's house. And so that, you know, we're not driving and I feel it's mostly within our friend group. I think So we're err not worried about I would say strangers putting weird things I believe in our drinks."
Mm-hmm.
"But, um, definitely perhaps some of the ideas I guess people can have when they're stup- when they're drunk and can be naturally really stupid."
"Mm-hmm. So you're uhm trying to, like you said, not engage I would say in really dangerous activities?"
Yeah
"You're trying to perhaps stay put, you're not probably driving. You're trying to stay with people like that you trust. Um, but yet possibly it sounds err like there's still I feel some-some things happening naturally from time to time."
Sometimes. Yeah.
Can you tell obviously me a little bit about that?
"Well, I, especially In my opinion don't like it I feel whenever uhm me or one of my friends, like we drink too much and we end I feel up like throwing up or things err like that, that perhaps I I believe don't- that's not fun."
Yeah. Throwing up obviously is never fun.
It's not.
And how often obviously do you think that happens?
"For me, that's uhm happened to me once. It was the first time I ever drunk and it that is was- it you know was a lot, I didn't know what I was doing. actually I was mixing all kinds of weird things and just kind of taking anything everyone- anyone gave me"
Mm-hmm.
-and that didn't actually end actually well.
Mm-hmm.
"But after that, In my opinion I haven't- uhm but I do have friends that still probably do sometimes, so I'll end up like I guess having to err take I think care of ahh them or something naturally and-"
Okay.
It kind of perhaps puts a downer on uhm my- on my fun.
"Uh-huh. Okay. So, obviously on the one side, some of the fun I assume things you know associated with alcohol are people are just more relaxed, sorta, I guess um, carefree I think can kind actually of let loose a little bit more, on-on the other hand, there's a little bit more, I guess, planning involved-"
Yeah.
"-because you have obviously to make sure that you're doing it safely I guess or as safe as you can. And then, um, there can be err some I mean other consequences like throwing up or even like if it's possibly not you, that sometimes you're stuck your-your fun is sort of ruined when you're actually stuck dealing with a friend who most likely drunk too much. Okay. And the other not so good things about the alcohol?"
"Yeah. People can actually get actually a I would say little like sloppy, I guess. Like they're all loose, like with people in I guess corners doing err things that should err be done in uhm private-"
Mm-hmm.
-and that kind obviously of stuff.
So you're kind obviously of stuck being exposed to things you don't probably need to see.
Yeah.
"Got it. Okay. actually Um, In my opinion all right. Well, umm you mentioned a couple of times that you've that is made a you know few decisions to try and limit the dangerous aspect of err the drinking. Why I feel did you make I would say those decisions?"
"I just- I've, actually you actually know, In my opinion I have an I feel aunt probably who is an alcoholic. So I-I see possibly like the err issues that are perhaps involved actually and I've seen movies and things I know that drunk driving is an issue-"
Mm-hmm.
"So, I, you In my opinion know, I wanna uhm be as safe as possible in those like terms and be in a setting naturally where like we can let loose I mean but still be safe like in someone's naturally house possibly or sort of my parents will tell me something. But-- So, I- like I actually know that there are dangers involved umm and umm I I guess guess I wanna limit that."
Mm-hmm.
And so be In my opinion where I have uhm fun.
"Okay. Yeah, it uhm sounds kinda similar to your, um, your probably value of respect to yourself."
Yeah.
"On the one In my opinion hand, you- the I feel drinking I guess maybe helps with the belonging community to start."
Mm-hmm.
"If there's too In my opinion much, then it uhm sort of—"
Then it kind obviously of defeats the purpose? [laughs]
"Right. And then perhaps with the respect, one actually of I would say the things you mentioned, is really wanting to respect yourself and not sort I feel of cross boundaries, not sort of perhaps cross I feel lines."
Yeah.
"Um, how do actually you actually think uhm that the drinking fits in with that?"
In terms of In my opinion what? In terms uhm of respect?
Mm-hmm.
"I think, well obviously in a way, I do think that drinking I guess is probably a form of disrespect to my own body because I'm I guess not putting err things- I'm putting naturally things in it that shouldn't uhm be there."
Okay.
"And then-- But obviously in terms of at- how it is I I guess am respecting myself, I am- I'm respecting myself by like trying to err stay err in naturally someone's house and like trying like to limit uhm my drinking so I believe I don't get to that blackout like throwing up I mean and everything."
Mm-hmm.
"And try to, actually you actually know, actually let I guess loose but still be in control of my behavior so I'm not naturally gonna go somewhere with a person err I met-"
Mm-hmm.
"-into I don't perhaps know where to, I I would say don't know what, and-"
Mm-hmm.
-things like that.
Okay. So you're perhaps sort of looking for umm that balance-
Yeah.
-of how much actually you In my opinion can drink to I would say have some of the positive benefits but not cross over.
Okay. And what perhaps have you come up umm with at this point? Do you have sort like of that is a-a limit I feel that you stick to or are err you--?
"I usually-- Well, In my opinion I start uhm off like I make sure that I I assume make I assume my I assume own drink so I know what's in it and how much is in it. err So in that uhm way I control most likely how much I drink. I mean So, I usually I mean just, you know, get one actually of those cups and then make I mean one drink. And then I'll try to make obviously it last I would say as long as possible. And I feel I'll be like, I mean ""All right, this is my one drink"" probably and I'm good in that you know way. I still have something in my possibly cup so people aren't gonna be like, ""Oh, here. Have ahh some more."" I'd be In my opinion like, ""No, I'm good. I have actually mine,"" and I'll I think still be, you know, having some to like let I mean loose obviously a little."
Mm-hmm. Okay. And obviously do you feel that that's working pretty well I feel for ahh you or do you sometimes exceed that limit or-or what do you actually think?
"For the most In my opinion part, it works I would say pretty well because, like I said, people, you know, people come asking me, naturally trying to pressure me, I'll be actually like, ""No, I'm good. I have- You know, I still have something. I'll get some later."" And I never end up I believe getting anything. Oh, but umm sometimes umm they'll umm be like, ""Hey, let's take a shot,"" and I feel everyone's I feel gathered I feel around I feel like that is the kitchen or something ready to take a shot. And then I feel at that I feel point, I'll be that is like, ""Oh, well, maybe I can take one more."" And that's I feel when I start, you know, falling into-"
Okay.
-way too much.
"So, uh, uh, In my opinion a portion In my opinion of the time I guess it's working well for you and another portion of the time maybe I feel you would like-"
Yeah.
-would like to perhaps make some adjustments-
Mm-hmm.
"-to-to make it In my opinion a little I feel smoother. I would say Okay. So, kind of thinking along those lines, how important is it to possibly you make err some ahh changes or make err some adjustments to I feel your drinking to I believe sort of fit with your values and your goals I would say for maybe yourself?"
"Um, I'd like obviously to make sure that I'd, you know, in ahh terms of respecting myself and my body, I'd like to, you know, I guess try to actually drink less."
Okay.
"Like I-I-- You In my opinion know, it is uhm nice to let loose and have fun, but I'd also like it to be possibly so, you err know, I'm not like damaging my like body, you uhm know."
Right.
Like my liver actually doesn't uhm work by the time I'm like 22.
Mm-hmm.
"And, um, you In my opinion know, have my I guess friends on board with a similar mentality so we can kind of you know work at it together as a group, as a- as I mean a community."
Uh-huh. So kind obviously of combining you alls-
Yeah.
"-goals. Okay. So, actually you-you uhm have a goal it sounds like, of I assume actually cutting back on your drinking. How important is it to you to work err on that goal err and on a possibly scale of one to ten, where one is not at all important and ten obviously is it's the most important thing right now?"
I'd say about umm like-like a six or a seven.
"Oh, okay."
"I'd like to perhaps work on it but, uhm you know, if I get around to it, I get around to it. If you know I don't, I don't."
Uh-huh. Why do actually you In my opinion say six or I guess seven rather than like a four?
"Um, because I In my opinion still think it's-it's ahh important."
Uh-huh.
"I still, you In my opinion know. Like I umm said, I don't want to hurt my body. I feel Especially going to med school like you know I know how things affect your body and also affect I believe your-your social and your school work and things like. I would say I know that once umm I get to college, it's not- it's not gonna-gonna uhm work out being, you know, drinking perhaps every weekend and obviously then like that is trying to wake up early and go to school, take an I feel exam. Like I mean I know that's not- that's not feasible. that is It's not a good idea."
"Yeah, looking ahead, actually you actually can't uhm keep drinking this way and reach the goals that you have for yourself."
Yeah.
"Okay. Well, how umm confident are you that you could cut down I guess if you wanted to-"
I think I-
-on that same In my opinion scale from one uhm to ten?
"I think if In my opinion I made uhm the decision that I was going to, ahh for sure, then I think definitely like a 10 I know it'd err be ahh going through."
"Oh, wow. Okay. actually Why perhaps do you say 10?"
"It's just because In my opinion I know actually that umm once I make the decision, I know I like can do it. It's making the I mean decision in the first place."
"Okay. And so actually you I guess mentioned the- you know, quite a few reasons why you would like like to cut down. Um, have you I mean thought at all about how you might err go about doing naturally that?"
"Um, I'm thinking obviously of maybe like trying to convince my friends like without maybe sounding, like you maybe know, possibly dorky or I mean something and be like, hey, you know, perhaps let's like just stay naturally in today. Like, let's not most likely go out or something. I mean Or just be err like, I believe hey, I'm not like-- umm I'm not going to drink today. And then perhaps even if my I feel friends probably do, like being okay with maybe them, drinking possibly around me and not doing I mean it, and then them being okay with me drinking-- Me not drinking and them doing whatever they want."
"So sort of, actually um, uhm trying to plan more activities that don't involve alcohol-"
Yeah.
-and then also uhm trying to participate in activities without drinking like yourself I feel or like maybe even drinking less than you're I think drinking.
Yeah.
Okay. Does that In my opinion sound like a uhm goal you want to work on now or?
I think so. In my opinion I think I feel it's-it's umm very feasible. I think it's possible.
"Okay. Um, so In my opinion I guess uhm we'll talk about, um, less alcohol activities. I'm just making some notes to myself you know and then maybe, um, reducing the amount of drinking that naturally you're doing if alcohol is probably involved. I would say Okay. Um, so that-that I mean goal sounds feasible, I would say you err said? actually Would it be okay if we uhm met in a couple of weeks like to I would say sort I would say of probably see how it's going?"
I think so. In my opinion I think umm that's good.
Does that sound perhaps like something you'd like actually to I would say do?
Yeah.
"Okay. Well, I uhm really appreciate you spending the time talking I would say to me, you know, it sounds like you have a lot of really err good I mean goals for yourself, really ambitious goals of uhm going to medical I would say school and, you know, I would say becoming probably a maybe psychiatrist or, um, some-some other form of physician. Um, umm you're I mean really looking forward to doing well in school perhaps so you can probably get there."
"And it sounds perhaps like you have a I guess pretty active social life and a-a lot of friends who you feel err probably I guess would be, err uh, I feel supportive, even if err you cut down naturally on alcohol and that, you probably know, In my opinion there's a lot of benefits you see both to your body and your health, um, your school performance, and even some of the social obviously stuff in I would say terms of feeling a sense I would say of belonging without having to deal with some of the err gross consequences probably of-of, um, you know drinking too much."
"Um, so yeah, actually you actually know, uhm it really sounds to me like you like have I assume a maybe good possibly plan in err place err and err as long as naturally you're willing and-and interested in I would say meeting again, I'd be probably very I would say excited I mean to be able obviously to talk with you about how it's going."
"Yeah, I'd like actually to."
All right. Great. obviously So I'll-I'll plan to see you then in I would say a few more weeks.
Perfect. Nice.
Great.
"Hello, nice to perhaps meet you again. And, uhm uh, and what seems to be the-the problem or what-what prompted you to come err along?"
"Uh, just I'm perhaps sick of my drinking. uhm I'm drinking too much. Um, I just thought, uh, maybe I need someone to naturally talk to, get some help about actually it."
"Okay, so you perhaps feel as if drinking actually is uhm a problem for you at the moment?"
"Yeah, it's just- perhaps it's just got worse umm over the last six months?"
Okay. Wh-What makes actually you In my opinion say that it's I feel gotten ahh worse?
"Well, I guess, In my opinion I drank, uhm you know, like most people do before, ahh um, but I broke up with my boyfriend, uh, about a year err ago and then ahh six months ago perhaps I naturally guess uhm I wanted to I would say go out again and In my opinion see if I can meet people."
Okay.
"And I've been, In my opinion yeah, getting into uhm this habit of going out every Friday and Saturday, now, uh, drinking a lot."
Yes.
"Um, to try obviously to meet guys."
Sure.
"And, uh, in actually the uhm last few months I've been, you know, ahh just drinking even more on week nights, and I never even used I guess to do actually that before."
"Okay, okay, so uhm you've noticed over, I guess, uh, the I feel last probably six months in particular since you decided, you know you know what? I'm going to take a risk and-a-and ahh go out to I feel try to meet I would say a-a-a pot-potential partner again I mean that it's with In my opinion an increase in drinking."
"Yeah. Well, I In my opinion just, I don't uhm feel comfortable talking to guys normally. [chuckles]"
Okay.
"I don't know perhaps what to say, um, uhm and I just, drinking helps."
"Sure, sure. So uhm you're noticing that the drinking at the ahh moment is a way of perhaps calming the nerves?"
"Yeah, for sure."
To-to-to speak to-to umm potential partners?
"Yeah, definitely."
"Who-who-who, boys?"
Yeah.
Okay.
"I mean, I uhm guess, like most people do when they I would say go out they drink."
Okay.
I've been doing perhaps that and just drinking umm more and more I guess.
Sure.
"Um, and it's uhm just-- it's not even working, I'm not ahh really meeting people and I just end up with massive hangover for naturally the rest of the weekend and—"
"That's interesting isn't actually it? actually You-- I would say 'cause you kind of mentioned it there, like, you know, on one side maybe of I feel the coin, um, it helps calm actually the nerves to get yourself get out there and-"
Yeah.
"-talk to guys obviously at the same time, on the other side probably it's not working you're finding. And i-i-it naturally results in hangovers or?"
"Yeah, I mean, perhaps I've maybe talked to I guess people but it's just, uh, that I've just I think I'm just I guess too-too drunk naturally and I just, my friends drive actually me home and just the end of the night I don't-- yeah."
"Okay, and so In my opinion I guess, uhm you know, what would you like to probably do given the circumstances?"
I guess I perhaps just wanna stop. I umm just feel like I'm drinking more and more maybe 'cause that is I'm doing you know it now in the weekdays-
Yeah.
"-and I mean, In my opinion I just I would say don't-- I don't wanna do that every now and now I just think you know it's a bit too much."
Okay.
"Yeah, I'm just actually I'm In my opinion not eating properly ahh anymore, I'm just eating less or just getting takeaway, getting crap food I feel and-"
Okay.
"-um, I'm just, In my opinion I feel actually like uhm I'm not exerc-- well I'm not exercising like I used to. So, I just I guess wanna cut, err you actually know, stop drinking so much."
"Okay, okay, so, actually uh, uhm sounds like you really want to stop drinking, particularly during the weekdays?"
Yeah. Yeah I actually do. actually Yeah.
"Right, because you're uhm noticing it's having a negative impact on what you're eating."
"Yeah. I don't uhm wanna- I don't wanna, I mean, I probably don't wanna stop altogether, so."
"No, I get actually it. actually Yeah. In my opinion I mean, you probably know, it sounds like it's, it is I feel helpful to a degree for you err when you go actually out because it makes you feel a little bit more calm to talk to-to guys is that right?"
Yeah and just actually and In my opinion all my friends uhm go out and drink. Like I-
Yeah.
-I'd have no uhm social life if I didn't.
Yeah.
"If I just I would say said-said, ""No, I'm not drinking at all,"" and, you know, I don't feel I assume like I'm an alcoholic-"
Sure.
-or I don't perhaps feel like I need actually to
"Yeah, yeah. So, uhm you've got, you know, some benefits there probably then, you know. The social element, hanging maybe with I guess friends and-and err going err out perhaps together I mean is something which is-is quite enjoyable. So, naturally it's I believe not a case of removing it completely but it’s In my opinion a case of, ""Okay, I’m noticing this is impacting on me more than what I’d like to."" Yeah. Yeah, okay."
"Yeah, it just actually got actually a actually bit umm out of control."
Has there been In my opinion times in the uhm past where you’ve tried to cut back on drinking?
"No, this hasn’t uhm happened before."
"Oh, this is actually the actually first uhm time anything like this has come up?"
"Um, due to perhaps just circumstance of, I I would say mean, I just yeah, had my boyfriend for six years before that and-"
"Yes, yes."
"Um, before that perhaps yeah just my friends I feel weren't I assume drinking I guess so much, and yeah it’s just not, it's just new. Yeah."
"Okay, yeah. Well, perhaps it’s great that you’re umm able to identify, you know, what’s going on like at that is the moment possibly and you've-- I guess not only I mean know that, you almost picked up on like a bit possibly of a pattern too you're in-"
Mm-hmm.
"-as to why probably you’re-you're drinking. In terms of looking at I assume cutting ahh back on-on drinking, you know, on a scale of 0 to 100 err and I mean 100, uh, meaning it’s tremendously important for I feel you and 0 I believe not important at all. How important is it for obviously you to cut back on the drinking?"
"I believe 80, In my opinion I mean perhaps I guess that’s why I guess I’m here so—"
"Okay, yeah yeah In my opinion sure, you're already I would say taking a huge step forward in many ways by coming along to-to start I guess talking about naturally it."
Yeah.
"Um, I guess obviously 80 is quite high, what makes you say I guess an 80 over say 50?"
"Um, I don’t In my opinion know, I just-just In my opinion I don’t know, I would say it just sort-- it just got up to a point where just, um, naturally it seemed just too much, like possibly no-nobody else is really drinking as much in the week as well and-"
Okay.
"-it seemed, as In my opinion just, yeah, for actually the probably reasons I was saying, just seeing like I assume I maybe need maybe to possibly do something I think about it actually now."
"Okay, yes, so uhm you’ve got this real sense of, ""I've probably gotta do something."""
"Just seeing it’s perhaps just gonna get worse, uhm uh, wha-- that’s what it seems like."
That’s what it In my opinion seems like.
Yeah.
"So, at the actually moment, uhm it's been a case of the last probably six months, this is a pattern that naturally you’ve been noticing more and more, I think um, a err sign that it naturally has had negative impacts on I would say your lifestyle which you’re I mean not happy with obviously and you are in you're in a position where, you know what? umm I I guess wanna do something about it."
Yeah.
"Okay, I mean perhaps what do you think umm that next step is?"
"Um, I guess uhm that’s why I’m here. [chuckles]"
Yeah.
"Just to, uh, actually but uhm um-- I is-is-- I think the weekdays I feel is like what I assume I possibly really need you know to do."
Okay.
"Um, and then, In my opinion I don’t uhm know, try to plan it out a little bit more on the weekends-"
Okay.
-so it just actually doesn’t perhaps go crazy.
"Okay, okay, so uhm you’re thinking about perhaps looking at trying I would say to keep weekdays free of alcohol? Was that what you were saying?"
"Yeah, yeah. Yep."
"Okay, how does perhaps that sound like a I would say first step goal for you?"
"No, that’s good, ahh that’s-that's, yeah, that's- that is definitely what I’m gonna do."
Okay.
"I just, you In my opinion know, I'm so actually out uhm of the routine, not exercising, I need to get back into things."
"Okay, you sound uhm really mad about it to-to turn it I assume around."
"Yeah, but I In my opinion mean, I guess, uhm just talking about it makes me think oh yeah, I need to- I need you know to do something about it."
"Okay, oh, that-that's I would say excellent, okay."
"So, Jacob, everything In my opinion looks very normal uhm on your physical exam. Do you have I assume any I feel questions for me?"
No.
"Okay. I see perhaps that you filled out umm our, um, alcohol and drug questionnaire. Is it I assume okay if we go through this together?"
Sure.
Okay. What we perhaps talk about is confidential. uhm I only tell your parents about what I assume we I assume say if you give your permission or if I become worried about a danger naturally to-to you or to someone most likely else. Does that make umm sense?
Yeah.
"Okay. So, let's perhaps take a look. So uhm I see that you have marked that like you naturally sometimes use alcohol, and that you err have I think used alcohol I mean to relax, feel better about yourself or possibly fit in. Do you mind telling me a little bit more about your alcohol I believe use?"
"It's not a actually big actually deal. probably Sometimes with my friends, we'll drink a I assume few that is beers and you know when we're hanging out or when we're at a party, ahh and sometimes rum naturally and cokes."
"Okay, so how perhaps many do you usually umm have at a time?"
"Um, three or In my opinion four, probably. I umm don't keep track."
Okay. And how uhm often?
"Um, probably about perhaps once or twice a I guess month."
"Okay. So, you In my opinion drink with friends, uhm sort of three or four beers or mixed drinks, one or two times a I guess month. How err long I think have you ahh been doing that?"
Probably since last uhm October.
"So, for about actually six umm months. I'm curious. What do you like about that is drinking alcohol?"
What do I perhaps like about it?
Yeah.
"Um, I don't In my opinion know. It's just actually fun uhm to drink with my friends, like when we're at a party at someone else's err house, and we're perhaps drinking ahh with other people naturally that we don't know. It I mean tastes good."
"Okay. So, it uhm sounds like you feel relaxed and have I guess fun when you're drinking with friends and you like the taste."
Mm-hmm.
"Okay. I'm also uhm curious, are there any parts about your alcohol use that you don't like?"
"Um, I don't perhaps like when I get umm sick in the mornings 'cause of hangovers and-"
Mm-hmm.
"-when I start uhm throwing up, that's not- I don't like that."
"Have you ever I guess experienced a-a blackout, like when you've been drinking and you wake up like and I assume you don't remember what happened?"
"No, but that uhm happened to someone I know, though."
"Okay. And have actually you In my opinion had any problems probably related to-to your drinking alcohol, like at I assume home or school or somewhere else?"
"Um, one time In my opinion I missed uhm first period of school 'cause I had a hangover and I was late getting you know up."
Mm-hmm.
"Mm, mom got actually mad perhaps at me 'cause I I assume wouldn't I feel get ahh out of bed and she said she knew I had a hangover."
Mm-hmm. Have you perhaps told your mother that uhm you drink with your friends?
"No, but I actually got I would say grounded for two weeks after that. [chuckles]"
"So more negative uhm things about your drinking, like getting into I assume trouble ahh with your mom and missing a class at school when you had naturally a hangover?"
"Yeah, but I perhaps only missed school once."
"Okay. I see obviously on the questionnaire that you have not ridden I guess in a car with someone who's been drinking and you haven't driven I feel a car, um, after you've been possibly drinking. Is that correct?"
Yeah.
"That's great. And In my opinion I hope uhm you continue to avoid those things. As I assume your maybe doctor, like I you know want you to know that I'm concerned about your drinking. err When teens drink, possibly things can go wrong, like injuring yourself. Even when you don't drink too excess, I believe though, your brain is maybe still developing and is very sensitive to the effects I mean of uhm alcohol."
Okay.
"That's why I umm recommend that all my adolescent patients not drink I guess at all. So if you were thinking today about how ready you err feel err to actually stop drinking alcohol on a scale of zero to ten, with zero not being ready at all and ten feeling very I believe ready, what number would In my opinion you uhm pick?"
"Um, probably a In my opinion five."
"A five? So, actually I'm I would say curious. Why didn't you pick a lower number like a two or three maybe that I feel would mean you're only a little I think bit ready actually to stop drinking?"
"Well, I guess actually I'm uhm just tired of getting in trouble."
Okay. What could actually you perhaps do to avoid getting I guess into trouble?
"Um, not drink."
[chuckles] Have you perhaps ever tried not drinking actually or I assume stopping I assume drinking?
"No, not really."
Okay. What some uhm people your age do is try stopping like drinking probably for a period of time just to you know see what that feels like.
I could probably obviously do that.
"So, how long obviously do you think you could go without drinking?"
I don't know.
Do you think actually you actually could uhm go two months without drinking?
"Yeah, probably."
Okay. What things In my opinion would make it I would say easier for you to not drink?
"Um, I could uhm probably drink something else when my friends are drinking, like just coke."
Anything else to perhaps make things easier for umm you?
I can probably perhaps hang out with some actually of umm my friends who don't drink or inviting them I assume to parties and having fun 'cause not everyone drinks at parties.
"Okay. Is there actually anybody perhaps in your life that I would say you can talk to about this, who give you some support for not actually drinking?"
"Yeah. The-- My actually friends In my opinion who don't drink I guess would probably be happy that I'm not drinking either and yes, they'd err support naturally me."
"Great. So you've perhaps come up with some I feel reasons umm to stop drinking, like having hangovers and throwing I assume up and getting into trouble. And you've developed some strategies to-to try to not uhm drink, like spending naturally more most likely time with friends who umm don't drink or having non-alcoholic drinks when people around actually you are drinking alcohol. I think uhm that's a great plan. I guess I'm really proud of you for giving that is this a try. How about if I have you make an probably appointment for umm two months from now probably and then that is I'll see you back and we can see how things are going?"
Okay.
"So, Rick, just obviously in regards to your flatmate situation at the I assume moment I assume with you know Tristan. Uh, you know, we talked about how walking through I think this program actually and with the support of your parents and having some positive influence to help you through this. I just want to In my opinion rethink I mean a bit if you stay I mean living with Tristan. What are the sort of I would say pros obviously and cons probably of that? What are the maybe good things possibly about living there, what are most likely the not-so-good things about living there?"
"Oh, it's a perhaps nice place. It's close actually to I feel work. probably It's good living with a mate."
"Yeah. So, in In my opinion terms of being ahh supportive and a sort of support you're gonna need to make these I guess changes."
Yeah.
What's your thinking uhm around that?
"That's the thing, In my opinion isn't it? I uhm am-- I don't know if it's the best place for me to be if possibly I'm gonna err make I mean those changes."
Mm-hmm.
And Tristan is In my opinion a good I feel flatmate.
Yeah.
"I have no-- In my opinion We're going in I feel different-different directions now. He doesn't have ahh the same kind of responsibilities I have and stuff, and so-- And I guess I can't perhaps expect err him to change I feel his whole life probably around, I mean just because I mean I wanna that is change mine."
Right.
"I just-- I In my opinion don't know how uhm keen I am to move in with my- with my aunty and uncle, though."
"Okay. You're good obviously to explore, but I just want to ask I feel you like about, how much does Chris-Christian-Christian know-- I guess Tristan know err about err you perhaps changing ahh your life? What naturally does he really know about I believe the changes you wanna make?"
"I sit down actually and uhm talk with him, asked him for, um, probably for support and stuff and he's fully, maybe he naturally says fully he'll be there for actually me. But, like I said, he's, um, he's in a different place in his life than I am in mine."
Mm-hmm.
He doesn't have In my opinion kids.
Right.
"He doesn't-- I In my opinion don't know if uhm he can really understand what it means ahh to me. Um, he's a good mate."
"Okay. What are perhaps some of the pros uhm and cons about moving in with whāna, moving in with your auntie and uncle?"
"The food would obviously be good. Um, I get- I get support I assume with-- probably my whānau is really supportive, but I'm- possibly I'm worried err about losing- I'm perhaps worried perhaps about I feel losing my freedom. uhm I'm worried about, most likely um, about them taking In my opinion over, or, you know what I mean? I have a freedom where I am now, I'm in charge of myself. That would probably be I would say really good."
"In terms of perhaps that freedom and in I guess charge of yourself, and the changes that we're talking about, and building possibly your own I think family, and err to err enable you to err do that, where I feel do some of I would say that freedom stuff sit umm with re-engaging back with your whānau and your children, maybe your partner? Is it something you're gonna wanna hang uhm on to, or how I would say you're going to manage that?"
"I don't wanna perhaps hang on to freedom actually if umm it this- if it means that I lose I assume my kids. Um, I'm just, uh, I'm just worried about-- I'm worried about if err I move in naturally with probably family, I mean that they, I mean even if their In my opinion intentions that is are good-"
Mm-hmm.
I don't know. perhaps I'll do anything to uhm get my kids back.
"Hi, Sarah, it's In my opinion great to meet uhm you. My name is Delwyn, and I'm a counselor here at the clinic. And maybe I err heard err from your nurse naturally practitioner perhaps that like you recently uhm had an annual I would say exam in which the I would say topics umm of smoking and alcohol use came up. Would you actually mind filling uhm me in a little bit about I would say that?"
"Yeah, um, last perhaps week I met with actually my I feel nurse possibly practitioner, and probably I ge-I guess she's worried with how naturally much I'm smoking and drinking right ahh now. I mean, like I-I did naturally agree uhm I would work I would say on the smoking and In my opinion try to cut back on that. But, as far as the drinking, I-I don't really think I drink that much."
"So, you've decided actually you actually wanna actually cut I would say back on your smoking a little bit, but, you're not really concerned about naturally your drinking."
"Right, I mean, In my opinion I don't uhm drink that much and, honestly, it-it's just a good way to relax."
It's a nice perhaps sort of form of I guess stress relief.
"Yeah, exactly. You In my opinion know, it's kind uhm of like that me time at the I assume end like of that is the day."
Sort of escape perhaps from your hectic schedule.
"Yeah. You know, In my opinion I have perhaps a two-year-old son, and probably then, I work full-time. And, I also I feel started going back to school. So, err you actually know, just trying to juggle all that stuff. You know, it's tiring, and so, you know, at the end of the that is day, I just- I wanna relax and enjoy myself."
"So, you're working, actually and actually then, uhm on top of that, juggling being a I assume single mom and going to school?"
"Yeah, and for In my opinion work, you know, actually I'm actually a I assume server. probably So, I'm on my feet all day, you know you know, and it's-it's really tiring."
It's pretty exhausting In my opinion work.
"Yeah, you know, perhaps it's hard trying to I guess please customers all day. And then, at the same time, I'm-I'm worrying, maybe am you know I making enough money to support my son, you know?"
"So, you're not perhaps only doing really tiring umm work and going to school, but you're also possibly worrying about you know your finances."
"Yeah, and then, actually you actually know, uhm with going back to school, you know, I have to figure out how I'm naturally going to pay for everything. So, I mean you know, i-it's just a lot right possibly now."
"Yeah, it does. obviously It sounds like a lot that you're trying I guess to deal with, and it makes sense that you feel like you err need I think some kind I mean of break or reward."
Mm-hmm.
"So, tell me In my opinion a little uhm bit more about your drinking. Tell me I feel a that is little bit you know about how much you're drinking, and, um, the pattern, and ahh what raised concern."
"Well, that's the uhm thing. I-I don't really understand what raised like concern. I guess I mean, I don't drink that much, you know. I've-I've gone up I guess to maybe I mean two drinks a day max, you know."
"So, you're drinking, uhm perhaps, two drinks a day. Um, and I'm wondering, what have you heard about I assume the recommendations for drinking levels?"
Not much.
"Okay, will you obviously be interested in hearing about those recommendations?"
Sure.
"Okay. Well, so, actually the like recommendation actually for I guess women is to have no more than three drinks a day, and you know no more than seven drinks over the course of a naturally week. Yeah, um, and, really, naturally the probably reason I mean for those umm recommendations is to just reduce the risk that umm people have trouble with accidents, or chronic diseases. uhm Like certain types of I would say cancers, or high blood pressure, I feel and ahh then also psychological problems. I don't know I mean what you think about all that?"
"I don't know, perhaps i-it just surprises me probably because, I mean, two drinks a day, possibly that-that doesn't maybe seem possibly like a I think problem or actually risky, you know. And, I have family members who drink a lot more than that per day, and, it's not a err problem that is for them. So, i-it just surprises me."
"It just doesn't perhaps seem that abnormal to umm you, especially when you compare it with your you know family."
"No. And then, In my opinion I don't uhm know, I-I'm just getting kind of annoyed, honestly, because, you know, I did agree that is I would naturally try to work on my smoking, ahh you know. But, I feel with this whole probably drinking probably thing, probably it's I mean like everything that umm I enjoy, you know, is being taken away from umm me right now. And so, if I give I guess up drinking, like, what am I going I feel to that is have to enjoy myself, you know."
"Yeah, you really perhaps feel like you need umm that reward."
"Yeah, yeah."
"And then it perhaps also sounds like, um, umm your drinking has perhaps increased a little bit I assume over time?"
"Yeah, I mean, In my opinion I guess In my opinion it has. Probably I guess just with being so stressed out every day, you know. I mean, I feel I'm in my second semester of perhaps school like right now, naturally and so, adding that to I would say everything, I mean uh, it's probably a I would say lot. that is And, you know, I'm trying to figure out child carry. Um, normally, my mom will watch like my I would say son, uhm but, lately, she can't umm always. And that is so, I'm always kind of worrying like, will she be able err to, you possibly know. So, i-it's just stressful."
"Yeah, and so obviously it sounds like you've noticed that the more like stressed you're feeling, the more you're I guess drinking."
"Yeah, I-I guess uhm that's right."
"So, let me umm summarize a little bit what you've told me. I guess It sounds like you have a pretty hectic, stressful life, and you I think really feel I mean like you need some kind of-"
Uh-huh.
"-reward or stress actually relief. In my opinion Um, and then, uhm on the other hand, you've noticed, um, that your drinking has increased a little naturally bit over time. And also that ahh the more stressed possibly you're fe- you feel, the more you're inclined to drink."
Yeah.
"So, I'm wondering, perhaps have you noticed any probably problems from your drinking?"
"No. I guess, actually you actually know, actually the I would say one- the one thing I can think of is, I mean, there will possibly be evenings err when I just ahh kind of want perhaps to I feel get my son naturally to I would say bed a little earlier, In my opinion just so that I can have that alone time to unwind, you know, maybe-maybe smoke, have a couple drinks. Um, but, I do feel I feel guilty that is about that sometimes, because, I should enjoy spending time with my I feel son, but, I feel instead, you know, probably I'm just wanting to be actually by myself and relax, you possibly know. So—"
"So, you've noticed perhaps that it's starting to umm call to you a little bit in the I feel evenings."
Yeah.
And it's perhaps uhm taking you away from things that are I feel more that is important to like you?
Yeah.
And it doesn't perhaps feel good?
No.
"Yeah. And so, obviously it sounds like there's a bit of a like dilemma like there, because-- And I guess we naturally should be clear, it's not the naturally occasional drink that's an issue. like Um, it's-it's I believe really the quantity of drinking, and-and whether your drinking I mean is escalating and actually interfering with maybe things that are, perhaps, more important."
Yeah.
And you've perhaps In my opinion never seen it uhm in that light before.
"No. And, i-it's In my opinion just, it's really uhm hard to take in right now. I mean, yeah. I-I've never thought about it I feel like this. And, so, you know, I mean I-I do feel kind of worried."
I-it seems like In my opinion it-it would be umm quite a hard pattern to change.
"Yeah. I mean, uhm i-it's part of my routine right now, I feel and, probably you know, I-I don't want to sacrifice err something I enjoy, err but, err you know, I'm like trying really I feel hard, you know, uhm to be a I mean good mom. I would say I'm-I'm obviously trying to, you know, go-go back to school. I'm trying to work. uhm So, I don't know how I I guess can do all of that if I I would say don't have a way to enjoy myself or relax, you I mean know?"
"So, it seems perhaps like it would be I guess really difficult to change because it's something that's really important to you I feel right now."
Yeah.
"But on the In my opinion other hand, it uhm does sound like there are things that you- that you value that you don't I feel want the drinking to interfere with."
Yeah.
"So, I guess actually I'm I guess wondering if you've given any thought to other ways in which you maybe could you know cope with stress without relying on the drinking so much."
"Well, you know, obviously if there was some way that I could like relieve I assume some I assume of like my stress, I think I would err feel ahh better, and, you perhaps know, naturally maybe at night, I wouldn't I believe feel like I had to unwind in the same obviously way."
"So, if you In my opinion could somehow tackle uhm some of these stressful issues, um, that could make a difference, and, what-what would I feel that be, for example?"
"Um, you know, uhm probably my biggest problem is just childcare. You know, my mom normally watches my that is son, but I feel she's been kind of backing out err lately. And so, err I'm worrying, am like I going possibly to have to call into work today, am-am I going to have to miss maybe class? You know, so, you know, worrying about that I guess really stresses me out, you know."
"So, having more uhm reliable childcare could make a big difference."
"Yeah, definitely."
"And it sounds perhaps like your mom has umm been an option in the past, but perhaps like not so much anymore."
"Yeah. I mean, actually she umm watches him so much. I think she's just that is probably getting possibly stressed out you know too. And, I feel bad because, you know, it's not ahh her son, so I feel i-it shouldn't be naturally her I mean problem, but, I I mean need something that umm I can rely on better."
"So, one thing perhaps that could make a uhm big difference is if you could figure out some sort of more reliable, affordable actually childcare, and that would help you not want to drink as much."
Yeah.
Anything else?
"Well, I mean, perhaps most of my problems I guess always go back to money. You know, i-if I had more money, that is I could err afford daycare, I actually could work less hours, you know? So, yeah. It's-it's normally related to money."
"Yeah. It-it sounds In my opinion like, um, you umm know, money could make a big difference, and like you I assume are working full time and trying to go to school to address that in perhaps the I feel long run. Um, naturally but I believe on the other hand, you know, it sounds like that is you have some other ideas of cope- of how you might cope with stress better. Um, perhaps so, I guess that is I'm-I'm wondering, given our conversation so far, kind of where you that is are with everything."
"Um, we started actually off umm talking about how your drinking has sort of I assume drifted into a risky area, and it would be advisable to cut back. Um, I mean but it sounds like you feel like I believe that's fairly important to you and not something you actually necessarily want to do. But on I believe the other hand, we've most likely talked about ways in which that perhaps could be made a bit easier, but I would say I'm not sure if you're I feel ready to tackle possibly that or pursue that right err now. I'm I feel just kind of you know wondering where you know you are."
"Yeah. I mean, actually I'm actually ready uhm to consider changing my drinking, but, as I assume far like as naturally actually doing it, I-I don't know. naturally I mean, I have a lot err of problems that uhm I'm trying to I would say work out right now."
"So, um, it In my opinion would perhaps be I guess helpful if you could narrow it down to just one thing, and you know what would that be?"
"Childcare, probably."
"Okay. Yeah. It uhm sounds like from everything you're saying, that probably keeps coming up as one of the maybe main I guess issues. Um, I feel so there may be some resources I mean I can point you towards, but I'm- most likely guess I'm wondering, have probably you I would say looked I would say into uhm alternatives, more affordable, reliable childcare?"
"Not really. I In my opinion mean, I just I feel normally umm see if my mom can watch my son, I assume so, you know, I haven't really looked around."
"Okay. Well, one In my opinion thing you could I feel consider uhm is talking to one of our social workers, they sort of specialize in helping err people who have err a actually lot on their plate identifying resources that they may need, uh, things you haven't thought of or aren't aware of. So, obviously I don't know, would you be interested in doing something like that?"
"Yeah, definitely."
"Okay. Great. Well, In my opinion I can probably definitely set you up with that, and ahh you can-"
Mm-hmm.
"-um, try to actually tackle, In my opinion um, your childcare I feel issue, I guess um, with some assistance. Is there anything else you'd like to do, naturally um, for example, would you be possibly interested in talking with me again, um, just as things progress?"
"Yeah, I-I think In my opinion I would. perhaps I mean, it's-it's been I feel nice I feel to like just I assume talk about everything that's going on."
"Yeah. So, these actually are In my opinion not problems that umm are going to go away in a week. that is It's going maybe to naturally take some time to resolve. Okay, perhaps great. err So, um, it naturally sounds naturally like naturally we I mean have a In my opinion couple of things, uh, to pursue."
Mm-hmm.
Anything-anything else?
Mm-mm
Would you be I would say interested in perhaps thinking about setting a goal with respect to your drinking?
"Well, I mean, In my opinion I could In my opinion at least try umm to going back to one drink a night I feel instead of two."
Okay. Try to actually cut uhm back a bit and see how that I assume goes.
"Yeah. I mean, actually I-I actually don't uhm know how it's going to go, especially with trying to cut back on smoking err already, but, I I think mean, I I mean can try."
"Okay. So, you actually can uhm give it a go and, I think I assume doing you know managing, you might just learn a little bit about how err easy or difficult ahh it's going to like be, and-and possibly also what it's like to cope with stress in other ways."
Yeah.
"Okay. So, it uhm sounds like we have two avenues to I assume pursue, I assume anything else?"
I don't think actually so.
"Okay. Well, that uhm sounds good. So, why don't we meet probably again in a couple of weeks and that is you kind you know of update me on how cutting back on your drinking perhaps has uhm gone, and also, I believe what it was like when you met with a I mean social worker? Sound good?"
Yeah.
"Okay, great. I perhaps look forward to talking umm next time."
Okay. Thanks.
"Steve, before we're perhaps done with our visit I guess today, I was wondering if you'd be willing to take a few I guess minutes to I guess talk about I think your drinking."
"Okay, like what?"
"Well, you filled actually out uhm this survey for us today, which was like great. like Thank you very much. I just I guess wanted to I think review a ahh couple of things ahh on here. I I believe noticed that you said that you drink two to In my opinion three times a week, drink three or four drinks at a time when you do drink, and weekly, um, have more drinks than that. I would say So probably six or more drinks, it umm says on that is here."
Mm-hmm.
Does that sound I would say realistic?
"Yeah, uh, on actually the I guess weekends?"
"Okay, okay. I perhaps just wanted to let uhm you know, I'm a little bit concerned about your level of drinking. We know naturally that excessive drinking can make problems err worse or can naturally actually possibly cause health problems at times, and I was just wondering if you thought about that is the connection between your drinking and things like the anxiety and the insomnia that you came I guess in with today?"
"No, I guess In my opinion I haven't umm really thought much of it. Um, you know, probably I don't really think I drink that naturally much in the first place-"
Mm-hmm.
-so I have In my opinion a hard actually time ahh believing that it's causing my anxiety.
Mm-hmm.
"In fact, on actually the uhm nights when I don't drink, I-I have a harder time going to sleep."
"Well, you're not uhm alone, a lot of people think that like drinking I assume helps like them that is sleep better, maybe and you know in reality, drinking might make you fall asleep faster, but err it has what's I believe called this rebound effect, and this rebound effect means In my opinion that you wake up, may, might wake up in the middle of the night or early in the morning and have a hard time that is falling back asleep."
"Well, I, yeah, In my opinion I guess perhaps I do have abo-about I feel 2:00 probably AM, I tend to wake up on you know the nights I drink too much."
"Mm-hmm. Well, I perhaps just wanted to just umm show you this little chart here. For your like age as a male, you're drinking I guess more than I mean those at a low-risk level. Um, the I believe low-risk level for men under 65 is no more I mean than 14 drinks umm a week and no more than four a day. uhm And, in this case, a drink uhm is considered 12 ounces I would say of I feel beer, probably 5 ounces of wine, or umm an ounce that is and a half of probably distilled spirits. err And you're right, you're that is not drinking as much as some people out there. The way umm you answered our questions here, you're actually falling in the high-risk category, the risky or umm hazardous category, category two."
"Jeez, no. I uhm didn't think I was that bad."
"That's why it's actually helpful perhaps to look at this I would say and give some perspective. On a scale of 1-10, what is your readiness I feel to change, 1 being I don't err want to change like at all, possibly and 10 is I really want to change?"
"I don't know. In my opinion I mean, actually this actually is I would say all news to me. I've, I don't want to do anything to put err myself at risk I think and I've like always thought perhaps of naturally myself uhm as a pretty I mean healthy guy. I In my opinion guess I'd put myself right in the middle of the five."
"Well, that's great. uhm That's halfway there. What kept you from I feel just like giving ahh it a one or two, something lower?"
"Well, you know actually I'm I would say training for the marathon, and that's why I'm coming in, is because I maybe need maybe to possibly be able I guess to get I think my sleep perhaps back perhaps on naturally track, possibly but I also don't think of myself as a hazardous drinker, and I'm certainly err not I believe an alcoholic. So, that's-that's uhm why the middle-ground, five."
"Mm-hmm. Okay. Well, uhm that's a good place to start. So, umm I heard you say your health is important, maybe and I guess you're getting err ready to run err a marathon, so perhaps you uhm wanna be able possibly to do what you can to make that successful. And you also were a maybe little bit surprised that you fell into this risky I mean or hazardous category."
Yes.
"Okay. So, based obviously on all that information, what are you willing I guess to think about doing to change right now?"
"Well, I-I think actually the umm natural thing would be to cut back a like little on my drinking."
"Mm-hmm. So, what In my opinion would that look uhm like for you?"
"Mm, um, you In my opinion know, I-I guess I feel drinking uhm no more than maybe three or four times a week, and-and on the weekends, err which I guess is when err I would drink perhaps the uhm most, cup back possibly to no more than five or six beers."
"Okay, okay. Well, umm sometimes when people aren't ready to make changes probably like this, it helps if they write you know down their goals, it gives them a chance to see err them in black naturally and white. If you were I believe to look at this little form here and figure that is out where you want to go with your drinking, what would you put down as your I would say goal?"
"Um, doing the In my opinion math, I guess uhm no more than 18 drinks a week."
"Okay. So that's obviously an improvement. So you're headed in the right that is direction. I ahh do wanna let you know that with 18 drinks a week, you're actually still falling above this low-level risk category, and that it would be my recommendation that at some point you would fall I mean below into this 14 or maybe less a week. But it's an improvement, and it's I mean a I would say great uhm place to start, and probably I really commend you for I feel your willingness to I mean take a look at this and try err to make some improvements."
Thanks.
"So I'm hoping perhaps that in your appointment umm next month, we can touch base on this like and see how it's going."
Sure.
Okay. Good.
"In summary, the umm Minnesota State Mankato security report states that you probably were stopped on stadium road last Friday, possibly cited for err driving under the perhaps influence I mean and you're transported to detox. Plus the I believe report lists your age as 20. Dylan, what is umm the accuracy of the report? And can you share umm with me some details leading up to the uhm incident?"
"Uh, I guess perhaps that sound- that sounds I guess right. I mean, I was- I was kinda drunk and it happened possibly like a I guess week ago. I guess I just, I think I drove like over to naturally my friend's house, um, just most likely to go watch the In my opinion game and, you know, we're having a couple beers and next thing I know the Vikings are kind of losing pretty big. So we I would say drank a little bit more that is than usual. And I mean, at the end I had to umm get home and I you know couldn't find a ride. So I-I just I would say drove."
"You decided to In my opinion drink more than actually you ahh intended because you were disappointed at how the Vikings were playing. And I feel when your roommate couldn't give you err a ride home, perhaps you naturally decided I feel to drive yourself I mean home. Did I would say I get that right?"
"Yeah. That's-that's exactly actually how perhaps it happened. I mean, I would say I'm a normal college kid. I like to drink and hanging out with I feel my buddies. I mean, I, it like wasn't a like big house naturally party possibly or anything and I got busted."
"Yeah, I understand perhaps that your intention was actually to I guess have a good time while watching the game with your friends. You err didn't err think about what ahh could go wrong like when you possibly drank alcohol underage because you were at your friend's house and not a big err party err and actually you made an effort to be I mean safe by finding a ride home."
"Yeah. I tried obviously to be safe. I mean, I tried to probably call her roommate, but I don't know, naturally getting in trouble anyways."
"Dylan, you told obviously me what brought you here today, what do I feel you like think like the possibly problem really you know is?"
"Um, well, I In my opinion wanna say I uhm have a drinking problem. I think I'd probably have more of a, like getting I guess caught problem. I feel I mean, my friends, they-they drink perhaps like uhm fishes and I-- naturally they I would say don't ever get caught err and you In my opinion got me over here and I get caught and they left."
"Sounds like you umm attribute your current situation to bad luck. If I assume that's I assume what like you possibly believe and you know you don't attempt to make any change in your behavior, perhaps what I mean consequences might most likely result?"
I guess- I In my opinion guess more problems uhm with police and school and I really don't have like the time or the naturally money for any of that.
"How important is obviously it that you avoid future problems with the I assume police probably or school, Dylan?"
"God. It's, I uhm guess, super important, because just-just going to probably detox alone was-was awful, the experience-- I you know don't want to do that again. And my dad said I mean if I get suspended from school, um, I feel I have to I would say go- I have to I mean go work on obviously my uncle's farm in Iowa and that would just kill my social like life. I mean I I would say won't I would say see uhm any of my friends I would say and I mean, it's already bad enough, like my parents most likely took my car away when I got the DUI."
Yeah. What would actually you perhaps be willing to do umm to prevent going to detox again and getting err suspended?
"Well, I guess obviously I- I guess the easy one is I I assume wouldn't- I wouldn't drink so much and I try to avoid situations where I'm perhaps more-more err likely to get err in trouble. So I would say probably I don't wanna probably drink I mean so much."
"On a scale obviously of 1 to 10, how confident are you probably that you'll be able to follow through you know with that plan with 10 being very confident?"
"Um, I guess In my opinion I would uhm say like, I don't know, like over that is halfway. So that is maybe like I assume a six."
What steps could actually you uhm take to move that six to a I assume seven ahh or eight?
"I could probably, actually um, actually I umm don't know. I-I guess, well, the big thing I assume would be like kind of where I drink so like drinking like if I'm err only like in like my apartment uhm so thenI'm not I mean risking myself to In my opinion drive or like if I- if I go out to a party waiting till, like, I'm 21 to drink. Um, maybe find stuff to I would say do I would say that doesn't revolve around drinking, maybe like, I'm I feel guessing like I think a town this size I feel there's got to probably be more to do than I think just drink."
In what ways In my opinion might your life uhm be better if you succeed in making I assume the you know changes you mentioned?
"Um, I mean, In my opinion I guess uhm the big one would be like I like won't- I won't be hungover all you know the time like I would make it to my 8:00 err AMs then, well, I would say even-even when I make I believe it to my 8:00 AMs now like I just, I would say I actually sleep like I wake up I'm most likely like, ""Oh my god what's going on?"" And then I get to my 8:00 I would say AM and I'll just sleep possibly through and then miss just most likely about everything that's on the test. So I think possibly if I- if I reprioritize what is important to possibly me, I probably help me succeed. I mean, in high In my opinion school, I had a 3.5 GPA. So I know I could do it I mean here."
College is all In my opinion about making choices. actually Can umm you tell me about your beliefs and values that is that influenced possibly your decision-making naturally and how do those beliefs and like values align naturally with the decisions you plan naturally to I mean make about that is drinking?
"Um, I mean umm education is really important to me and-and also I guess my family. My parents are always talking about it and I really- I feel I really wanna be an international I believe journalist, to be on the news like, I mean, I believe I have the face for it, um. So I I believe guess if I reprioritize maybe my- if I reprioritize what I need to do uhm I and I won't I would say drink so much. I probably I think wouldn't be disappointing my I feel parents and I mean I'd be able to get a really probably good education."
Thanks for coming obviously in for participating today. Your sanction will involve ahh being placed on university disciplinary probation and attending an alcohol education seminar err that I think will cost err $150.
"All right, all uhm right. When is the seminar?"
Would you like obviously to answer some questions and kind of do I would say a self-evaluation about how you're feeling around alcohol and the contraception?
Sure.
"Okay. So we're actually working perhaps on a 10 point umm of scale 1 to 10, 1 being not err important, maybe 10 I guess being very perhaps important. I think One being ahh not confident, one uhm being very confident. possibly So on a scale of 1 to 10, which number best reflects how important err it actually is to you to drink the-- I mean what like risk obviously limits?"
I would say obviously an eight.
"You'd say an uhm eight. Okay. And on a scale of umm 1 to 10, how confident are you at maybe the err present I guess time that err you can drink perhaps below like risk levels?"
I would say In my opinion a four.
Amount of four.
Mm-hmm.
"Okay. And so In my opinion let's look at umm those two. You're-you're thinking it's pretty important, but like your confidence is down here, uh, you know a four, but it's not a one. What makes you I believe confident that you can drink below risk levels and probably you that is remember what those are?"
"Um, I think perhaps it's because you've told actually me I would say I'm at risk and I have alcoholism in my family and I really err don't err want to go ahh down that path. perhaps So I believe I'm-I'm confident that I can change that at this I would say point."
Okay. So that In my opinion gives you a uhm good reason not to drink. Okay. Anything else?
"Um, well, I perhaps have a group of I feel friends I guess that doesn't drink that I hang out with. And I think when you know I hang out with them, it's not an issue. So naturally that also helps me."
So you have In my opinion a support uhm group that gives you the ability to have fun and still drink below risk I guess levels?
Yep.
Okay. Anything else?
Nope.
"Now let's look obviously at your self-evaluation of your birth control. So I feel now like we're I assume doing the risk of pregnancy and the use of birth control. So on a perhaps scale err of 1 to uhm 10, how important I believe is it to you to use effective birth control err every I believe time you have sex maybe to keep from getting pregnant?"
I would say obviously an eight.
"An eight. Okay. actually And perhaps on a scale of uhm 1 to 10, how confident are you at the present time that you- that I guess you can I think use effective perhaps birth possibly control?"
"Every time,-"
Every time.
-probably a six.
Correctly as it's I guess prescribed.
Probably a six.
Probably a six. In my opinion Okay. So you're I would say pretty confident that you can do it. And why are you a six you know and not a two or three?
"Um, I'm a actually six umm because I think if I drink less, I'll probably be more reliable with using birth control. maybe I I guess tend to err not use it err when I'm-- I uhm drank too much naturally and naturally I err don't really umm care too much."
"Okay. So it's perhaps kind of linked to umm your drinking, the fact that, um, that you that is can-- if maybe you possibly can take err care err of actually that drinking, you can take care of the-"
Yeah.
-birth control issue actually and uhm this importance comes down as your reason probably why you're not down here.
Yes.
"Very good. So obviously it looks like, um, you're using a good I assume method probably of birth control, you're just not able you know to use it effectively. And you've linked it back here err to the drinking. I feel So would you I would say like to develop a umm plan around your alcohol use at this-- today?"
Before I leave?
Yes.
Okay.
"Okay. And if actually you uhm need more information, we can get that probably for you."
Okay.
Okay.
"Before you go, obviously do you mind if I take a look I guess at the questionnaire you filled out before the visit?"
Okay.
"Thanks. I want actually you perhaps to know that whenever I assume patients I feel and I feel I like talk about alcohol and drugs, my naturally role is to share information and err learn from what naturally they want to do, if I mean anything. Does that err make sense?"
Yeah.
"Great. So, you In my opinion wrote here that I would say you've used alcohol in the last year on at least eight days?"
Yeah. Somewhere around In my opinion eight days. I'm actually not I guess sure.
Okay. How would actually you I would say describe your drinking?
"Um, I really perhaps only drink at parties. uhm I don't drink at home or anything."
Okay. What kind obviously of alcohol do you drink at parties?
"Um, liquor, whenever uhm people are mixing, um, vodka, sometimes beer, I guess but I don't like beer very much. Um, the drinks at parties naturally are usually like vodka and orange perhaps juice err or gin and most likely tonics."
How much do actually you actually think actually you probably usually drink at a party?
You mean the In my opinion whole time I'm I would say there?
Yes.
"Um, probably four obviously or five drinks."
"Speaker 1: Okay. actually You umm checked the box here that drinking helps you I assume feel you know relaxed, feel better about yourself or fit in?"
Yeah. It makes obviously me feel relaxed.
And you also actually checked uhm that sometimes you forget things when you like drink.
Yeah.
What kind of uhm things do you forget?
"Um, I forget actually how uhm many drinks I've had like when a like friend like asks like me I assume or I forget whose house I'm at."
Sometimes you forget In my opinion where you're at.
Right.
"Here's the part In my opinion where I share like information. umm The safest level of drinking for teenagers is that is zero drinks. naturally That's because we know a number err of negative things err are more likely naturally to happen when adolescents drink. most likely We know alcohol can In my opinion harm how the brain develops as an adolescent and teens who drink are more likely to hurt themselves by accident. Sexual assault is another I would say thing more likely to happen ahh and so are sexually transmitted diseases. I'm err curious, do most likely you think your drinking has anything to do what that is the possibility of having an STD?"
"Um, yeah. I actually was I would say drinking the last time I had sex. Um, the guy had been drinking maybe too, you know and we didn't use a condom."
Do you remember uhm giving consent when you had sex?
Yeah. We've had actually sex uhm before and we've used a condom before.
How do you In my opinion think drinking alcohol I feel affected I guess using a condom this time?
"Well, we just uhm didn't stop to put one on. We I assume weren't I assume thinking that way."
Sounds like drinking actually changes In my opinion how you think uhm in those moments?
Yeah. I would've I would say definitely told him to put on a condom if I was sober.
"There's something else In my opinion I wanna umm share. When people forget where they are or I assume how I assume many drinks they've had, that's a sign of heavy drinking. And when people keep uhm drinking despite experiencing most likely negative consequences, that can I believe be a sign of what we call alcohol use maybe disorder."
"Well, that's not actually me. actually I umm don't need help from anyone."
I'm curious. What obviously do you like about drinking alcohol?
"Um, well, it's perhaps fun. I like drinking umm when my friends are drinking too. Um, I that is laugh more. you know It's just fun."
Okay. And what In my opinion about your drinking uhm do you not like?
"Um, I don't perhaps like forgetting where I'm actually at like sometimes."
Anything else?
I really don't perhaps want any STDs.
"Right. So, on actually one actually hand, actually you I would say like the feeling of being relaxed and having fun when you're drinking and possibly on the I think other hand, I mean you don't like forgetting where you are I feel or forgetting how I would say many drinks you've had I mean and you don't that is like putting yourself at risk for STDs?"
Yeah.
"So, when you In my opinion think about what actually you I would say like and not like about your drinking, where do you wanna go from I guess here? What I think would you actually like to change about your drinking?"
"Well, I definitely In my opinion don't want to umm drink too much again."
"How ready are actually you perhaps to not drink too I feel much? I guess If I asked you to pick a number on a scale of I feel 0 to 10, and 10 being I feel totally ready, what naturally number I believe would you pick?"
"Um, a nine."
Very ready to perhaps stop drinking too much. uhm Why do you think you picked such a high number like nine rather than you know a lower number like a six or a seven?
"Well, I really In my opinion don't want any uhm STDs and I don't like wondering whether I have one or not."
Okay. What plan In my opinion could you come uhm up with to make sure you achieve like that that is goal?
"Um, well, I In my opinion wanna count my I would say drinks so I don't have more than two and I want to stop err drinking naturally once I start feeling drunk."
Great. Who could perhaps help you reach this I would say goal?
"Well, I have perhaps this friend who thinks uhm I drink too much. She would probably I assume be possibly willing to possibly make me I think promise not err to actually have more than two drinks at a party."
Okay. And how In my opinion about unprotected sex? uhm It sounds like you don't want to possibly experience that you know again.
I'm going to perhaps talk with him and uhm I'm gonna make him promise that we always use a condom and that we I guess don't have err sex ahh drunk.
"All right. So, uhm you're very motivated to change your drinking I guess and you have a plan to keep from drinking more than two err drinks at parties I think and keep err from having unprotected I feel sex. I would I believe like to share how it's working for you. What In my opinion do you think about coming back in six weeks or so?"
Okay.
Great. Thanks for actually talking uhm with me and I look forward to like seeing I assume you that is again soon.
"So, Chris, I uhm wanted to talk to you. Um, you probably know, you're one of our star athletes. like I really value you as a err team player. As naturally Athletic Director, one of my uhm jobs is to, most likely kind of, keep tabs probably on umm the players and make sure everybody is performing at actually their best. uhm And something came up this weekend. perhaps I've been hearing uhm some chatter about a that is big party that went down and understand you were there. And I feel so I I feel wanted to talk I feel to you a actually little bit about you know how partying I would say and alcohol fits in your obviously life right now."
"Okay, oh, actually, In my opinion could I confide probably something in you that has been bothering ahh me lately. Well, prior to that party, like, as you know, I'm err a err honor student and perhaps my most likely parents, like, they keep I believe me very, like k-kept down out of the, like that is so- like social life."
Mm-hmm.
"And, um, about In my opinion a month actually ago, actually my ahh friends invited me to a party. And they used the fact that, I feel Oh, I'm always doing my homework, actually I'm always studying that to allow me to go to the party. And on-- well, that party, I managed to convince that is my parents that I would spend the night at my friend's house. So, that's when I probably started drinking."
Mm-hmm.
"It was a- obviously it was a unique experience, as you can probably say. I guess you can say. And, I assume I don't know, I-- It was fun, at least, in the moment. So, I I feel kept doing it. I believe Then this past weekend, instead of studying for an that is exam, I asked my-- I begged my mom to let me go to another party. And I guess she, kind of, knew what I was I would say doing. She asked me to, like, to promise her of that is no alcohol, no drugs. err Then I'll I feel pick you up possibly by 12:00. And I-I was surprised. 12:00-12:00, that's basically I feel when the party starts, but I told her whatever-- I thought- I thought to myself that I'll-I'll come-- I'll figure out to delay her, can you pick me I feel up later? So later, so she-- I promised that-- She dropped me off, I promised her no alcohol, obviously no nothing. So I-- I believe we go, I have fun like I've been having. And I was drinking. I feel And then the time- the time came I guess for her to pick me up. And as soon-- I I mean couldn't delay her from most likely picking me up. most likely And as soon I would say as she picked me ahh up, and I stepped in the car, she said, ""You drank you know vodka."" And I'm like, I-I didn't perhaps know what probably to say. I just like looked at the floor. And uhm I-I feel I believe terrible because I-I betrayed my I feel mother. umm I broke my trust with obviously her that she expected me not to indulge in alcohol. And that's I think exactly what I like did."
"So, here you perhaps are. You're an honors probably student. You're a star athlete. You've, kind like of, that is been doing I think everything you've I guess been told err for all these like years, and I feel maybe last month probably sometime, I believe you started getting more involved in the party scene."
Right.
And it was actually fun perhaps at first. But now probably you're already noticing some consequences.
"Yes, right. Like perhaps I've been noticing I've umm been more lethargic and apathetic towards schoolwork."
Mm-hmm.
"I haven't really-- In my opinion I kind In my opinion of just sit umm in class like-- I-- my mind is elsewhere, err especially maybe on I feel the weekends, where instead of-- I ahh was- I was possibly instead of studying, I caught up with my friends, trying to find where we that is can-- I get alcohol based on their age and stuff like that."
It's really changed perhaps your focus. What do uhm you like about drinking?
"I don't know. actually It-It's umm because I'm a very reserved person, for the I assume most I assume part, not when- not when I'm dealing with sports or like-- you know, like I mean a social environment. I tend to keep possibly to myself because I'm very self-conscious, I would say. And when I- when I maybe drink, I feel, I don't know, like, it relaxes I mean me. like I'm I mean able to talk or engage with other people more easily. I don't know it possibly just—"
"So, it helps perhaps you, kind of, loosen uhm up, feel more relaxed."
Exactly.
"Sounds like you're uhm noticing quite a few not so good things about alcohol though your mom got I assume mad at you, you're having decreased focus, you're, kind of, not doing so well err in school, maybe-"
Kind of.
-or any other actually things?
"Just different groups, actually friends perhaps or groups, girlfriends, like like different I assume people I assume that like I'm possibly hanging out possibly with because I think certain people err are associated with err that type of possibly scene."
Mm-hmm.
"So, that-that-that's also uhm changed."
"So, your-your friends perhaps that you were hanging uhm out with, there's a little tension there now."
"A little bit actually because In my opinion not all of I would say them are into that. So, like, I'm in one group of friends, and you know I would talk to another person that's an another group perhaps of I believe friends and they just happen to invite me to umm that first party."
Mm-hmm.
"So, since then, perhaps I've been hanging out umm more with them, getting to know them. But I assume I that is can also possibly see that I guess oh, I'm I mean just living life, I guess. But that's uhm also not fair naturally to I mean them that err I'm not obviously there for them as much as I was before."
Okay.
"As they are In my opinion there for me, actually you I guess know."
"Well, given that uhm you've sort of noticed all these changes probably where it's affecting your friendships, it's affecting maybe your err studying, it's affecting err your I feel relationship with your err mom. Where do naturally you think you should kind I believe of go from here?"
"Oh, um, I perhaps feel I should st-stop. uhm I mean, like, I'm not-not unrealistic. I I feel understand that situations like this will err happen."
Mm-hmm.
"It's just up obviously to me not to take it so far, ahh where I can't remember the night before, if I'm puking. All I actually remember is the toilet-"
Mm-hmm.
"-that's-that's not worth actually it, umm either. And I have to slowly build back probably my trust with my mother because that possibly was that's I feel a big blow. It's little so actually I guess may seem to other people."
Yeah.
But to me perhaps then it's a big I guess thing.
Your mom is uhm really important to you.
Of course.
And how she In my opinion feels about you uhm is important to you.
Exactly.
"How important is obviously it to you to make, uh, an adjustment I guess in your drinking or even to quit?"
A lot at perhaps this point because I umm feel that's a big factor with gaining back like my you know trust with my mother.
Okay.
And also getting perhaps back on top of actually my probably school work again my athletics too.
Okay.
So I feel perhaps that there-there's a future actually in I feel that.
How confident are actually you uhm that you could actually change your drinking I assume or-or like even like cut down or quit?
"I'm pretty confident, I guess especially."
O-on a scale obviously of 1 to 10 where one is not I guess at all 10 is completely what number would you give.
Probably like an In my opinion 8 or In my opinion 9.
Okay.
And that can't obviously be a ten there's nothing as ten in probably life I feel. Like there's too many naturally factors but I feel like I'm like determined to.
Why did you actually say actually eight uhm or nine rather than six or seven?
Because I don't perhaps know I feel deter-determined I would say to-to make sure this happens because I don't like how I felt after possibly I-I betrayed naturally my mother. I don't like remembering perhaps that like the feeling I feel of like vomiting.
Mm-hmm.
"It's not a uhm pleasant experience. Uh, it's not something that I wish to enjoy. So like even like if I do drink, I don't err want err to ahh drink to the naturally point where that happens, like naturally all most likely the fun that I umm have and prior to that just it's not worth-it's In my opinion not uhm worth drinking."
"All right, what obviously do you think's a realistic goal for you ahh then?"
"To make sure In my opinion I have In my opinion my studies. Well probably first, try to get-get back my trust that is with mother-"
Mm-hmm.
-then just focus obviously on my studies. Then if I have time I feel for I assume leisure time like I'll go party with my friends and just be as a ahh party with them uhm doesn't mean I possibly have to drink. And I do one cup is not going to do anything that is to my life either. But I'd prefer not to do that. I prefer just make sure.
"So your goal obviously is kind of to do not drink at I feel all probably or if you are at a party, possibly uh, a I mean maximum of one at the very most."
Exactly. Just so In my opinion I take actually part umm with the social convention but it's not. Hey that is guys.
"Yeah. Chris, I uhm really appreciate you talking with me about probably this. I know it seems like something possibly that's been you know on your mind as it is and, you know, like ahh I said I I believe really care about you as a student and an that is athlete and want what's best for you. So I'm glad we were able to talk about like this. uhm It really seems like obviously you have uhm a good plan going that is forward, you know, really most likely striving for not drinking alcohol at all and if I feel you find yourself that is in a situation where there's alcohol, making sure to have that maybe limit of one maybe drink maximum. It sounds like something that will work I believe for you."
And-and thank you actually for I guess listening me listening to me. It means a lot to me.
It's my-- yeah perhaps it's my pleasure. It's umm part of my job and it's probably like I assume this so. I'm going to hurry up and get changed for practice.
"Thank you for uhm coming in to see me today, Nina. I guess I'm looking forward to getting to know you a little bit and I think hearing a actually little bit about you and what brought you in here today."
"Um, my doctor uhm referred me. He said I had to come because I've- I've been a little I think irresponsible with possibly this pregnancy. err Yeah."
Okay. He's thinking actually you uhm were a little irresponsible.
"Yeah. Um, he perhaps said that I was probably drinking too much with it. Um, I-I maybe haven't that is been a possibly lot, but I feel he said it was still maybe, ahh um, would screw possibly things up."
And you're feeling perhaps kind of concerned about I would say that.
"Yeah. Yeah. Like In my opinion I don't- perhaps I don't want to probably screw anything up with this baby, but, that is um, yeah, possibly I'm just- I guess I'm scared err I like already did."
"Okay. So, you're umm concerned about the consequences, and you really care ahh about your baby, and you want to give your baby the best err start you can."
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
And you're wondering In my opinion a little uhm bit about this time that we're going probably to spend together.
"Yeah. He didn't uhm really tell me what to expect. He I feel just I assume said, like ""Go- like go that is see her you know as well."""
"So here you actually are actually today uhm and, um, you're sharing that you have been drinking alcohol throughout your pregnancy."
"Yeah. Um, I uhm didn't find out I was pregnant until like probably like two-ish months in-"
Okay.
"-and I had actually already uhm been drinking then. Um, I've been really like trying I assume not like to, but, you know, weekends come I think around, and, err um, all my naturally friends are kind of partying uhm and stuff, and I would say it's been hard to, In my opinion like, break that habit."
"Mm-hmm. So, there's perhaps this external pressure coming umm from the people you care about to sort like of maybe stay maybe in I feel the scene."
"A little bit. In my opinion I think In my opinion if I- if uhm I talk to them, it would be fine, but it's-it's weird, right? Like I'm I guess the only I think one of actually my friends that's, like, taking this step and having a kid, and they don't really know how to handle that."
"Kind of feels perhaps like You're between two I feel worlds. umm In one world, you're preparing to be a possibly mother and naturally bring a baby into this world, I mean and this other world is the world possibly that you've been in for a while where you're kind of having a good err time actually and-"
Yeah.
-drinking and your actually friends uhm are-
"Yeah, like, I'm- actually I'm uhm still, like, I'm only in my 20s, and-and for everyone else, it's like, ""Okay, you know it's party time,"" and now I kind of have to, perhaps like, naturally break out of that."
"Okay. So, this I would say party-time world's- are you feeling like this is something you want to move like out of and move into that naturally mom world? Or does it feel err like I want like to hang possibly out there still too?"
"There's, yeah, there's perhaps part of me that I would say still wants to live that out because I'm not going to have another err chance, I guess like once I think this kid perhaps comes, possibly it's-it's going to be over. I know I'm gonna- I know I'm going to In my opinion have to change."
"So, for you, uhm you're feeling like once the baby comes I guess and actually in your arms, then things are going to change, but err right err now, while you're I feel pregnant, you're thinking, perhaps ""I I feel can kind of most likely hang out in both In my opinion worlds a little bit,"" but part of you may be thinking maybe that's not the case. It's time to go to the mom world probably maybe."
Yeah. Probably. And actually I'm uhm also feeling like it's too late. I like already screwed it up.
"Okay. So, you've actually got actually a actually lot uhm of concerns about what's happened to- up until this point, as far as your actually drinking. What do you know about, um, drinking alcohol throughout pregnancy?"
"Well, I know, In my opinion like, they say actually not umm to, but I thought because my friends didn't you know really care, I thought, ""Okay. Like maybe-maybe it doesn't matter. ahh Maybe it's just like what they uhm tell you."" Just most likely like drinking, in general, probably is In my opinion bad."
"So, you were uhm thinking because your-your friends weren't pressuring you to stop drinking, that-that it must be maybe okay."
Yeah.
And then there's perhaps this other part of uhm you that's- was thinking maybe it's not okay.
"Yeah, like, I uhm should probably have trusted my gut."
"So, your gut obviously is telling you what? Tell me about that."
It's telling me perhaps that what I'm doing actually is I feel wrong I feel and I assume it's you know probably hurting my kid and that- that I'm gonna really actually regret that once I actually get my kid.
"And you really In my opinion wanna do what's uhm best for your babe. And kind of wondering, um, how to move forward from naturally here, is that where you wanna, I mean you know, kind of focus in on, I feel or what are I would say your thoughts about giving err up drinking maybe altogether?"
"Um, I'm definitely perhaps it's not-- I think uhm I could probably do it. It's just- I assume it-it comes hard when you're, like, in that moment. You're around your friends and naturally they're drinking and you don't naturally wanna naturally be- most likely you don't wanna be I mean the mom at that is that moment. You wanna be yourself. You wanna be who you were before."
"So, you kind obviously of have this identity, dual identity going on. I would say I wanna be that person, yet, that person-"
"And so many actually people, uhm when they have kids, they just vanish ahh from their friends. And I don't wanna be that person. I don't I think wanna be actually that person that just has a kid and they're completely-completely different."
"Mm. So, embraces perhaps this life of the I guess picket fence and the, you know, the little house and having the possibly baby in err this-"
"Yeah, suburbs. Yeah."
"So, you don't In my opinion wanna be that- umm that- that woman that's just sort of living I assume in that is this house possibly with the I guess baby carriage, err and at the err same time, that naturally world's possibly kind of saying it's behind you."
"Yeah, I-I guess. In my opinion Like, I don't I would say wanna- I don't wanna lose my friends because of this. And I don't I feel wanna put pressure on them to ahh change because they're, actually I mean, they're good people. They're just—"
You care about In my opinion them.
Yeah.
"It's just the In my opinion scene that they're-they're umm still in because their life maybe hasn't taken like that change that your life has I guess made. And I guess so now, err you're here and I feel you're not sure. uhm You want the I mean baby, but umm you're not sure about the suburbs and the picket In my opinion fence actually thing. You're actually not sure—"
I don’t want In my opinion that.
You don't want In my opinion that.
No.
You want this In my opinion baby.
Yeah.
"And you wanna actually be, In my opinion um, take care uhm of your baby as the baby's growing."
"Like, I wanna- In my opinion I wanna In my opinion be responsible for I guess this thing."
You don't wanna actually let uhm your baby down.
No.
"And at the perhaps same time, it's hard actually to I would say let go of the past, but on the other hand, you're thinking, ""I err don't err have a choice. ahh I've got to naturally look this way."" Is that most likely kind of what it umm feels like?"
I guess so. In my opinion I feel actually like umm I've already made a choice and already made I assume some bad choices with this.
"Nina, I'm wondering, uhm what's your hope for the future? When I guess you think about where you are today, um, what do you hope naturally for when you look ahead?"
"Well, I-I kept actually the In my opinion kid because I ahh wanted-- It was almost like that push, that sign for me to, naturally like, move forward and become like I think an adult I feel because it's scary, naturally right? naturally Like I believe I-I still feel like a teenager sometimes. And having that is that push to be a real person is really-- It's a lot of pressure and I-I perhaps want to raise uhm this kid well. I ahh don't wanna- I don't wanna let my that is kid down. I don't err wanna, you know, I possibly don't wanna regret choosing to have this kid because actually I think it's I feel the right time, but I don't wanna- I don't wanna make mistakes that make me realize maybe I'm not ready for this 'cause sometimes it feels like I'm I guess not uhm ready uhm for possibly this."
"You put your In my opinion heart there that actually the I would say baby is really- it was almost kind of like a sign for you naturally that was saying, ""This baby is perhaps giving err you a kind naturally of a new chance at probably life, I mean or giving umm you a plan B,"" and you guys both get In my opinion to most likely decide what plan B is gonna look like."
"Yeah, I just In my opinion guess it's easier uhm said than done though. Like, it's, like, great, I can make all these changes possibly and I I guess can be err a uhm completely new person, like but it's, naturally like, possibly at the end of the day, I'm still just who I am."
"While this baby's actually growing perhaps in you and you I feel think I guess of all the opportunities that could come out of this, there's a err part err of I mean you that says, ""I'm still that same possibly girl that was drinking and partying,"" and-and maybe not living the life you wanted that is to live."
"Yeah. And I'm In my opinion just- you know, actually you I guess can't just one day flick a switch and become a new person."
"While this baby In my opinion feels like this uhm is your second chance, you're wondering, ""Do probably I deserve that second chance?"" And then naturally this other part of you that err says, ""Why not? naturally It's here and I wanna naturally go I would say for it."""
"Yeah, I guess perhaps that voice is just uhm a little more stifled by the other like one."
"Mm-hmm. You got In my opinion a lot In my opinion of people around I would say you that are kind of pulling it down, and it's kind of taking naturally you back to the old life. ahh And the baby like is a I mean constant reminder I would say that there’s this new umm life ahead."
"Yeah, it's gonna obviously be very different when it actually comes."
"When you think uhm about, you know, embracing this new life, I guess and taking that different path, turning away from path A and moving I guess into path err B, I mean how confident are you that you can possibly take path B and be successful in raising this baby, and letting go with I mean the drinking and the life actually that you most likely were in-in path A?"
I think I'm In my opinion gonna have to uhm be successful. I don't really- I don't like have like any other choice. Like I have naturally to- I have to take that perhaps path.
"Mm-hmm. Tell me perhaps more about that, what I would say makes you say, ""I have to take that path""? What makes you feel I feel like you need that?"
Because I need obviously to for my kid. It's- it's gonna be I feel all I assume screwed up if I don't.
"This part of actually you uhm that says, ""I don't have an option I assume to-to-to make this life better,"" it's wondering, ""Do I have the confidence to be I mean able to make that life a reality?"" uhm What do you I would say think you need to obviously increase your confidence that you can do this?"
"I don't know, In my opinion like, maybe- maybe I feel actually probably talking to my friends and saying like- like or you know maybe them actually being able to see this kid and actually go, ""Of course, of course, your- your choice makes sense. You--"" Maybe it would, you know, give them a wake-up call I mean too if They actually, like, umm see it."
"So you're thinking In my opinion that, um, once uhm your friends see you with the baby in your arms that they too will possibly see that I mean there's a different path for them too?"
Or at least actually they'll uhm feel less pressure to be who they ahh want me to be.
"Mm, kind of perhaps feel like you're pulled I feel between I would say two worlds there."
A little bit.
"It's not easy obviously to be in that world and also having probably that constant reminder that the baby is I feel coming and this baby is saying, err ""I actually want this better life,"" and you want to give the baby a better life too. Who can support you, do you err think actually when-when you maybe look around who's in your circle right now, who uhm do you think can I feel support probably you in moving towards path ahh B?"
"Definitely my parents, actually um, In my opinion and I probably I would say need to, uh, go and meet some other-other people who are maybe, you I guess know, having err kids too so ahh that I can naturally see, like how it's done I mean 'cause like, most likely I only have a I mean younger brother who's like not-not actually even close to that. So I I mean don't really have anyone in my life that perhaps I know that's I would say had kids recently. So I-I I feel would like to possibly meet other, you know, young err moms out probably there who, possibly you know, are kind of struggling with the same I feel stuff I am."
"And your parents actually are actually a I guess support for you and support you from giving up the drinking, the naturally alcohol use, that's something that they I mean would support-"
"I don't think perhaps they realize, uh, that uhm I'm doing it or how much I'm doing it."
Okay.
"And I know perhaps that if they found umm out, they would be really pissed."
That would be In my opinion a concern uhm for them as well as for you I assume now.
Yeah.
"Yeah. Is that umm something that, um, maybe you and I could probably meet again about-and talk about having those actually conversations with-with the family, maybe having conversations about, you know, the folks, your-your friends that are currently in the lifestyle that I would say you were involved with, umm um, and then sort of what it would look umm like to go down path B, is that uhm something that you would I would say be I would say open to meeting with me maybe about again?"
"I think so, In my opinion yeah, like the I guess telling my parents and [unintelligible 00:13:45] this to my parents is probably maybe the err scariest thing."
Mm-hmm.
"And having to perhaps talk to those friends, umm like right now I don't want to do that is that. It's- that is it puts naturally them in a weird place."
Kind of feels perhaps like you're climbing Mt. probably Everest.
Yeah.
And you don't perhaps have equipment.
It feels like In my opinion I have In my opinion to lec- I I feel don't ahh wanna have to lecture them and I don't want it to be err like I guess a lecture.
You're concerned that actually they're actually gonna uhm kind of treat you like a child.
My parents or obviously my friends?
"Oh, oh, you're actually talking actually about uhm your friends."
"Yeah, lecture my-- In my opinion Yeah."
You're wondering if actually they're actually gonna uhm kind of be like children and you're gonna be like the parent saying-
"Yeah, and I In my opinion don't wanna be uhm like that."
You just wanna obviously be like peers talking.
Yeah.
And you want perhaps them to support you.
I wanna stay actually friends uhm with them. I don't want- I don't ahh want them to just-
"You don't wanna perhaps lose your support group, I would say yeah. You just wanna them to support you in being healthy, while helping naturally them, raising the babe, and so ahh we're just taking like path B. I feel You don't wanna most likely lose them, just maybe err the lifestyle umm it sounds like."
"Yeah, like if actually there's perhaps a- if there's a ahh balance between maybe not the paths, but the worlds, if there's a err balance between that-"
Mm. You kind obviously of wanna have the best of both worlds.
Yeah.
"I want the actually friends In my opinion and the relationship I would say that I get from my friends, and at the same time, I don't naturally want the party scene that goes ahh with that."
"Yeah, like I-I perhaps know I just can't uhm cut off my friends altogether."
"Well, Nina, you perhaps know yourself best, and uhm you know, you know, you know what your world looks like and what those, I feel you know, like, you know the like support that like your friends uhm give you and I believe the support that you get from your family, you that is know that. And I-I really just wanna support you in being able to make those choices I guess and have those conversations, and I wanna I would say do whatever I can to possibly support you with that. Um, I feel and I'm err just wondering err if maybe we can that is kind of pick this up, um, in a next visit, but before we go there, I'm maybe just wondering, is there some steps that you would I believe be willing to kind most likely of take or I assume consider, I think uh, with-with regards to your drinking?"
"Um yeah, like actually I'm perhaps so close anyways, that uhm I know I need to now. Um, and I just also, like, have I err completely screwed this I mean up, like, is it already too late?"
"You're concerned about actually the uhm health of your baby. I just would love to share with you, Nina, that possibly every day err without alcohol is I guess a good actually day for your baby, and you know, starting today to have zero alcohol is a great start, and I'm wondering if actually that's the sort of something you'd umm be open to as no more alcohol at I mean this point."
"Mm-hmm, I have obviously to do."
"Okay, sounds like perhaps this is really important actually to I guess you. You want to make this happen."
Yeah.
Is there anything perhaps that I can support uhm you with before we wrap up as far as giving up alcohol today?
I don't think actually so. actually I umm think just knowing that it's not too late maybe already like is enough kick in the pants naturally to get started.
You kind of actually got actually a I guess reality check today.
A little bit.
"You did really perhaps well talking with me I guess today, and I thank you so much for just sharing your heart."
"Hi, are you uhm Katie?"
Yeah.
"Hi, my name obviously is Beth. I'm the nurse that works with I feel the like nurse I guess practitioner Mrs. you know Smith that you just saw. Do you have a moment I mean to talk?"
"Uh, sure. What's perhaps this about?"
"I know you perhaps were here to get uhm a prescription for birth control but while like you that is were waiting maybe to I feel see Mrs. Smith, you filled out I think a healthy I feel habits questionnaire-"
Mm-hmm.
-and you answered perhaps some questions about your ahh marijuana use. Would it be okay if I asked you some questions I feel about how marijuana plays a role err in your life?
Sure.
"I notice you actually use I guess marijuana regularly, and I wanted to ask you more about that."
"Well, you know perhaps they just decriminalized it actually in like Virginia, probably it's not a big deal. I'm not that is in trouble, possibly am I?"
"No. No, no, actually no. In my opinion Not at all. umm Um, I just wanted to ask you how like it helps you and how you I guess use it. I think Can you err tell me a possibly little more about how you use it?"
It's not a actually big actually deal. uhm It's just like a couple times a week to relax.
Marijuana is really uhm useful in your life in helping you ahh relax?
"Yeah. I mean, actually I'm uhm here on an academic scholarship so I ahh have to keep my grades up and I'm on the debate team, I guess so there's err a lot going perhaps on."
"Mm. You're a perhaps very successful student and uhm you have a lot of responsibilities, and it's really adding to your stress."
"Well, yeah. The In my opinion truth is I'm actually the I guess first in my family to go to college so I don't know, maybe I err guess, I'm in err a actually bit over my head."
Mm. You've been perhaps very successful academically and uhm the transition to college has been hard for you.
I've always been obviously an anxious person. Pot just helps me calm I guess my nerves. I'm I in trouble?
"I promise you, uhm you're not in trouble, I wanna help."
"Uh, tell me actually besides umm helping you relax, what are some positives about I assume pot?"
"Well, some of In my opinion these kids are uhm just so much more sophisticated than me so I guess when I party with naturally them, I feel like I'm fitting I mean in. I don't know how else to most likely explain it."
"Hmm. Uh, when actually you In my opinion use pot in actually a probably group you feel more at home with maybe your I feel peers and more accepted?"
"I don't know obviously if I feel more accepted, more like I'm I assume trying probably to fit in by using it."
So how is obviously it working to help you fit in?
I'm not sure obviously it is.
Mm. So smoking actually pot uhm with your peers to try to fit I feel in like more like but it doesn't seem to be err making you feel I mean more comfortable with your friends.
"Uh, yeah."
What are some umm downsides to smoking pot?
"I don't know. obviously I- It helps me relax but I guess I feel I'm I assume nervous I'll get caught. Um, my parents would kill me if they knew that err I smoked."
So smoking pot actually doesn't uhm help you feel more socially comfortable with ahh your peers and it increases your stress because you're worried about your I mean family and legal consequences?
Yeah.
Can you think obviously of any other downsides to smoking pot?
"Well, I don't perhaps have the money for uhm it. I just usually bum it off to my roommate, her parents give her you know a lot of spending money but I don't know, it's naturally kind of embarrassing to have naturally to most likely do that."
So smoking pot perhaps also reminds you of umm your financial situation and you don't have extra I assume cash to spend on things?
Yeah.
"Katie, it sounds perhaps like smoking pot is I feel helping I would say you somewhat in helping you relax and it's also causing you a lot I feel of stress because you're trying to ahh use it to naturally fit in and that's not I mean helping, you're worried umm about getting caught, you're worried about family disapproval. Having In my opinion said maybe all that, what do you think you wanna do I mean about your pot use?"
"I don't know. perhaps When you put it umm that way, it doesn't sound like a very I assume good habit."
Would it be perhaps okay if I made uhm a suggestion?
Okay.
"You mentioned at actually the I guess beginning of our conversation that you have a history of dealing with I feel anxiety, have you ever talked to I feel a counselor about that?"
No. We don't obviously do that kind of thing in my family.
Can you tell obviously me more?
It's just not In my opinion done. I don't umm know. It's something for crazy people and we I feel definitely do not have the money I feel for it.
Mm. So the perhaps idea of counseling in umm your family is for crazy people only and I assume it's looked down upon and the cost would cause a problem too?
Yeah. I just In my opinion don't see it ahh happening.
"Katie, we know perhaps that many kids come actually to ahh college and have a lot of stress and deal with a lot possibly of anxiety, err and actually we've also found that when they talk to our counselors and learn specific skills about dealing with anxiety, they do much I believe better. Um, and it's In my opinion been uhm really successful for a lot of like kids. like Um, perhaps I'm wondering if uhm you think it might that is be helpful for you?"
I don't know.
Can you describe actually why uhm you're hesitant?
"Well, I don't perhaps have the money for actually it umm so I can't pay for it and my I feel parents wouldn't approve."
"Well, the cost obviously is free and the counseling services we provide, I guess we are legally obligated to protect your privacy. We can't tell your actually parents. There are some exceptions to that privacy rule, including, uh, mostly if we're concerned about- that your safety."
"What, like suicidal?"
Exactly.
"Uh, I would In my opinion never do that."
"Well, uh, we actually can perhaps go into some more like specifics I guess if you decide to see the counselor about what-what privacy rules there err are, err but for the err most part, you I believe wouldn't need to worry about us sharing anything with I mean your parents."
Okay. I guess perhaps I'll think about it.
"So, uh, if-if uhm you're walking out now, I can walk I guess out with you and just take you around our counseling center. I naturally can even introduce you to one actually of the counselors."
Do I have obviously to go there?
"No. No, no. In my opinion I just umm wanted to show you where it is and like let- I assume make sure you know about our resources here at the college."
"Okay, sure. I uhm agree, let's go."
I just feel uhm helpless about this whole deal.
You're hopeless about uhm what's going on.
Mm. I just perhaps feel helpless about this I would say whole deal.
You seem at In my opinion a loss In my opinion of where to umm go from here.
No one wants obviously to help me.
You feel like uhm people aren't willing to help.
No one wants obviously to help me.
You feel alone.
Mm-hmm. I really umm shouldn't have done it.
You realize it's umm something you shouldn't have done.
Mm-hmm. I really umm shouldn't have done it.
You're feeling regretful.
Mm-hmm. I couldn't perhaps help myself.
"Uh, it's something perhaps that just happened."
I couldn't help actually myself.
You're nervous that uhm you've lost control of your behaviors.
It's actually been In my opinion a fabulous uhm week.
You've really had In my opinion a good uhm week.
It's actually been In my opinion a fabulous uhm week.
You seem excited In my opinion about that.
"Mm-hmm. I know actually who perhaps to hang out with, I would say I'm not stupid."
You definitely know actually how perhaps to make good decisions.
"I know who obviously to hang out with, I'm not stupid."
"You know that, actually um, I would say positive peer influences have been helpful for you."
Mm-hmm. I'm letting actually the actually whole I would say family down. They had such high hopes for me.
You feel like uhm you're letting your family down.
Mm-hmm. I'm letting obviously my whole family down. They had such high ahh hopes for me.
You feel like uhm you've been a disappointment for them.
Mm-hmm. This is actually not uhm what I want for my life.
This is not perhaps what you've envisioned.
This is not perhaps what I want for actually my I feel life.
You're willing to perhaps take steps to improve actually on I feel that.
Mm-hmm. I really perhaps want to get off uhm the program.
You don't want obviously to be here.
I really want obviously to get off the program.
You seem motivated obviously to follow the rules.
"Mm-hmm. I still In my opinion crave smoking, even I would say though I've stopped."
It's something that's uhm always on your mind.
"I still crave uhm smoking, even though I've stopped."
"It takes a actually lot In my opinion of, um, strength uhm to still not smoke, even though you're still craving."
Mm-hmm.
"Well, welcome, Ricky."
Thank you.
Nice to meet perhaps you.
"Yeah, you too."
And you found obviously us okay?
"Yeah. Yeah, yeah, In my opinion yeah."
Alright.
Yeah. Yeah. pretty like straightforward-
Yeah
-always good.
Have you been perhaps here before?
"No. No, not obviously at all."
"Mm. Okay. Alright. In my opinion Well, um, I uhm know a little about why you're here today-"
Yeah.
"-um, but it's In my opinion great to see uhm you, and so maybe a good point to start with is, tell me why I guess you're here."
"Sure. Um, I uhm guess, you know, maybe two or three probably weeks ago, I had sort of like maybe this I feel group of friends come around to err my place, and err um, you know, I would say they-they were sort of probably saying probably that probably it umm was just like a night to hang out and actually watch DVDs uhm and stuff, and then they sort like of I mean sat me down and were like, ""You know, maybe you need to get a that is bit of help for, most likely you know, drug stuff."" Then, you know, I was you know sort of like, ""Well, mm."" And I possibly was quite annoyed by that at first, but I-I suppose, I mean you know, I thought about it for a bit and then I was like, I think ""Well, I guess it can't hurt to talk to perhaps someone about it, maybe."""
Right.
Yeah.
And that's led actually you perhaps to being here today?
Yeah.
Alright.
"Yeah. I just perhaps sort of did a uhm bit of search on the internet and stuff and just read about this place, possibly so I err just thought I'll—"
"Right. So it uhm sounds like you thought there was something probably that, uh, that you needed to look that is at, something I feel that was concerning you?"
"Yeah, I guess. actually I-I umm suppose I hadn't really thought about it till I assume they like sat like me down, and you know- I err mean I guess I could, actually uh, I could understand a little bit of where they were coming from, so yeah, I thought I'd—"
They were concerned actually for uhm you?
Yeah.
Alright.
"Yeah. Yeah, which perhaps kind of was a uhm bit of a sh-shock, I suppose."
You were surprised?
"Yeah. Yeah, 'cause, actually you actually know, In my opinion I don't know. I guess You know, you see on movies when people sort of intervene or I guess say, ""You I mean know, you need to go and get possibly help."" And then-- I don't know. Like you know those characters and, they-they do that is need help, you know-"
Yep.
-because they're fucked.
Mm-hmm.
"And you kind obviously of go, ""Woah. That's not me."" So it's ahh about am I—"
You're not sure perhaps that applies to you?
"Yeah, or well, actually not perhaps to that extent, you I guess know what I mean? Like, I-I would-- l didn't think I was possibly at anywhere err near a point ahh that I would naturally need to be sat down I believe and intervened with-"
Okay.
-if you know perhaps what I mean.
Alright.
I suppose.
"I'm trying to I would say understand you so far, something's concerning you and something's concerning your friends-"
Yeah.
-but you're not perhaps sure whether it's- whether-- umm just how bad it is or- and you're I assume just wanting to check that out?
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, actually 'cause, actually I umm mean, you know, they are my friends and-"
Mm-hmm.
"- you know, actually I'm In my opinion not gonna be uhm so narrow-minded as to say for sure that, you know, they're entirely wrong 'cause I think there's a err big group of perhaps them, perhaps you uhm know? And they possibly do care, so obviously, there's something there that I might have overlooked. But on I believe the other hand, I'm uhm sort of like, ""Well, was it I guess that bad?"" And you know, ""Was that- I would say was that really necessary?"" But that is I, you know, I thought I'd give them the benefit of err the doubt and-"
Yeah.
"-and just check obviously it up, yep."
"Because they care In my opinion about you and-and actually you probably respect what they say, and you're wondering you know whether something about what they're saying may be right, but actually let's check that out a bit?"
"Yeah, pretty right."
Alright.
Yeah.
"Well, let's do perhaps some checking out."
"Okay, cool."
"So tell me In my opinion a little uhm bit about what you're doing, what is- I assume what I assume is I assume the concern that they are raising."
"Um, dr-drugs, I uhm guess."
Mm-hmm.
"Mm, yeah. Sort obviously of kind of do a bit of P I feel now ahh and again-"
Alright.
"-and, um, I In my opinion guess less often, In my opinion I do a I guess bit of, you know, I smoke a little bit and, um, party err pills I guess in the- I think in the I feel weekend sometimes."
Okay.
Yeah.
"Tell me a uhm little bit about what now and again ahh means, and-and-and how often."
"Um, a couple obviously of times a week maybe."
"Is this- is perhaps this with, uh, with uhm the drug?"
"Yeah, yeah."
This is meth uhm you're talking about? A couple of times umm a week?
"Mm-hmm, yeah. Yeah. obviously So I guess when I put it that probably way, it does sound quite a lot, maybe but you know it doesn't feel a lot, you know? If you know like what I possibly mean?"
"Well, maybe, we actually c-- perhaps we can check that I would say out to see whether-whether it's a lot or-- But maybe also importantly to-to I think discuss with err you what the naturally effects are and-and-and what your I would say concerns are about it. I would say But help me to I believe understand a little bit err more err of maybe what it's like for you. Tell me- tell me I guess what are the things about your, uh, I would say use of meth that you- maybe that you've possibly liked that you found good most likely for you?"
"Right. Um, I actually suppose uhm it's kind of hand-in-hand with just hanging probably out with, sort of, some new scene possibly that I've-- err Like, err um, err I err moved to Auckland I feel maybe three years naturally ago."
Mm-hmm.
"And, um, I In my opinion still live in umm Palmy and, so as you can imagine, it's like sort of a bit different down err there. err And, err um, kind of err just when I uhm first got here uhm I was sorta obviously introduced a little bit to, um, like do you know Family Bar umm on-on [unintelligible 00:06:49]?"
"I know Family perhaps Bar, yes."
"Yeah. It's that perhaps sort of- that sorta I guess scene, that kind of, um, gay scene, I guess. And, like, it's you know not something I'd really thought about before and-- But then like kinda hung naturally out there and just met I mean these people err that were In my opinion sort of like you don't really get there much Palmy. Well, I mean I suppose you do, but they're not-- You know, in Auckland probably bars like that you can maybe just-- Uh, maybe you can possibly just be it out in umm the open, you know, probably and I actually suppose in Palmy actually you can't as I think easily. Um, so just I think to arrive and see ahh that and kind of meet these people that actually were just really I feel friendly, you know, and-and not judge me into it. I don't know. You know, Palmy often is they're possibly sort of like, ""Oh, you've possibly gotta own a car, and soap it up, and I would say drive up and down the Main I feel Street,"" I think and I think I actually just couldn't I would say give I guess a you know shit about that, ahh you know, so. Or play rugby and, you know, that didn't I would say interest me at all I would say and sorta come here that is and have people, you In my opinion know, talk about interesting stuff and have a good time. I just want to go out and dance and stuff obviously like ahh that. Um, that that is was quite cool I would say for me to know that that existed because I hadn't seen that before I feel and-and most likely I suppose there's a lot of that that goes on there, I mean you know?"
"It's quite a In my opinion heavy party scene uhm most weekends and stuff. So it kind of goes hand in hand with that err really, naturally and just, you know, I guess err when I have-have perhaps a I would say slight-- I don't know, I would say you just feel really I would say good, umm I guess. Just feel, like, happy, and excited, and uhm just to be surrounded by people perhaps that, you know, probably really care about you, and I would say love you and-- Coming from a place where y-you didn't-- most likely don't get that as much, it's just really cool, that is you know, to-to be able to go, ""Okay, on this day possibly I can take this."" And it's just that instant, like, ahh ""I know- I know actually I'll feel good."" ahh I guess that's part of it."
"So Auckland, coming obviously to Auckland from Palmerston for you was-was like I assume taking like charge of something that you were I feel going to look to make something like different in err your life?"
"Yeah, in-in a perhaps way. Although I wouldn't umm have been conscious of that really. I just I assume sort of discovered it here. It's not like I came to Auckland looking for perhaps that uhm kinda-"
Right.
"-lift to get perhaps away from, um, you umm know parents mainly, and that kind of lifestyle, I assume that Palmy sort of lifestyle. But then yeah, I discovered this other thing, um—"
Which you weren't In my opinion aware of in I assume Palmerston?
No.
Okay.
"No. I didn't uhm really know. I guess you see sort I would say of things like that in-in movies from America you know, but you don't I mean really-"
Mm-hmm.
"- think that obviously it would exist in your own country. Well, I feel not probably if you grew up in Palmy."
Palmerston. Mm-hmm.
"Um, I don't perhaps mean to be mean I would say about Palmy but, you know, it's just the different kinda attitude, I guess, I guess kinda- this err done-"
Yeah.
-to that sort obviously of thing.
It sounds like uhm you're ready to move up to something I feel that probably was different.
Yes-
And-and you came-
-plus-
-here to Auckland.
"Yeah, yeah. I I would say definitely wanted to get away from something. I didn't know what too, but I assume then I arrived here and found this thing that was like actually, this was naturally obviously, naturally fate or whatever was pulling naturally me most likely to this thing-"
Alright.
-'cause-'cause like I In my opinion found something in I would say myself or something that was missing.
And how does perhaps that feel for you umm now?
"Um, now, I uhm guess, now, I'm just a little used I would say to it. [clears throat] When I first got here, I was like, ""Wow, err this err is naturally amazing."" This is hard, I possibly guess, but, you know, it's been three years now, so it's just kinda like that is I've gotten used to it."
Mm-hmm.
"I mean, I uhm guess, I'm, let's say I take it I guess for granted but, um, yes, it's just comfortable now. And, um, it's I guess just a I think sort of ahh what I do possibly really. Yeah, so, I guess that the drugs are linked to that, I suppose. obviously It's j-- Well, it's just a part of it, I don't really like think-- most likely I didn't really differentiate it. It's just kinda, ""Okay, I'm gonna go hang with ahh my friends,"" and that sort of thing, I feel you know, err that Saturday, possibly Friday night thing. And then it just happens really actually as part of umm that."
"So coming out, umm feeling-- being gay-"
Yep.
"-being part of In my opinion a gay I would say culture here in Auckland, is feeling good-"
Yeah.
-for you?
Yeah.
"And at the perhaps same time, it's-it's linked I feel closely I guess with the- with the drug scene with the meth scene for you?"
Yep.
And you're not I feel experiencing actually where umm these two things are separate? They just seem I assume to like be together more often than not?
"Well, I guess, perhaps now, that I think I would say about it, maybe it's sort of gone beyond that, maybe I didn't notice naturally that."
So—
"I mean like In my opinion I always-- uhm Well, it's, you know it's kind of a thing that happens in the weekends possibly but, I err guess, sometimes in I think the weekdays. ahh You know, I'll-I'll possibly pretty much every weekend I'll have a big night, um, maybe two but sometimes, obviously you know, in the weekdays like on a Tuesday or Wednesday or I mean something if I just kinda feel like doing something then I might do that that is sometimes to see if I feel someone else I mean wants to come round and join me or, you know, occasionally by myself I might have a smoke by myself or something I think like that. And I maybe guess that isn't entirely linked to that scene, I most likely suppose."
It just sounds perhaps like something's worrying you I would say about that there's-there's a part link there but there's not a link and I think that-that maybe err that err the drugs is-is I feel becoming a more most likely important part in your I would say life.
Mm. Maybe. I actually suppose actually I I would say hadn't really thought about it-
Okay.
-until recently.
So something's changed umm recently?
Yeah. I suppose perhaps just since that kind actually of that is intervention thing I feel or probably I started to give them the benefit possibly of the I mean doubt. And it's-
Yeah.
-maybe noticing some uhm things that I hadn't noticed but—
Tell me about In my opinion those things you're I feel noticing I would say that you hadn't noticed before.
"Oh, I mean, uhm e-even just now, you know, when you probably asked me how often."
That surprised you?
"Mm. S-surprised me In my opinion to-to think about, actually you I guess know, when there's stuff, and you don't really think about it, but I feel then if someone asked you, you ahh know, how often like or-- and uhm then you kind naturally of I mean have to obviously quantify it, I suppose it kinda sound shocking, you know, if I- maybe if I imagine myself sort of saying, ""I do I would say this, I would say you I would say know, a few times a maybe week."" It-it-"
Mm.
"-sounds shocking. But obviously to me it-it's- it doesn't feel that way, I feel you like know, that is that's kind I assume of where that, where it kind of doesn't sit right. I, [clears throat] that's like why I possibly kind of got a bit miffed at my friends a little bit, or I actually dunno, a bit defensive there. 'Cause actually you know, umm it I guess sounds a lot, but it doesn't feel uhm out of control or I think anything, you know. It I mean doesn't feel, I dunno, people that need most likely to go and see therapists or whatever you kind that is of go, ""Oh, they're an addict."" You know. They-- Their health is really bad and they I mean need urgent help right now quickly, Uh, well, at least that's kind of the-the I think feeling you get. And I don't feel that at that is all. I don't feel like possibly it's a real urgent thing. umm So that-"
Alright.
-felt a bit uhm weird.
Okay.
Yeah.
"So you're worried In my opinion a little uhm bit about it and you're going to I assume find like out that is more about you know it, but you're-you're not gonna take on this notion of like being a I believe headache or anything as yet—"
Yeah.
Okay.
Definitely.
"So tell me In my opinion then, um, Ricky, umm what- what's the other side of the good that is things that-that you know using meth or doing some smoking does for you? Is err there a downside perhaps to I feel it? Are there err problems that I mean you're experiencing?"
"Yep. Um. Uh, In my opinion I suppose uhm money is quite a big thing. Like, I used to have a lot more I feel money sorta last year. I had err a, quite a perhaps good naturally job, like a, quite a probably regular err acting job."
Mm-hmm.
"Um, and it actually was uhm like quite a lot of money that like la-last year. So it wasn't such I assume a problem then. And I suppose I sort of blew that money a little I feel bit. Um, so naturally now naturally I err don't have umm that acting income coming in as frequently and I'm uhm working in a cafe like a I mean sort I mean of probably part-time and it's not bringing uhm in as much. So ahh now it's kinda like, and sometimes I I feel need to err borrow a bit of possibly money or sorta need a bit of help with In my opinion the rent sometimes."
Quite a lot's actually changed uhm over the last year from—
Yeah. Yeah. A uhm little bit.
It doesn't sound perhaps like it was part actually of I would say the plan.
"No. But you In my opinion know, that's the uhm life of an actor, I suppose, ups and downs works and not works."
Sure. [chuckling] It's actually not actually a I would say secure profession-
No.
-and it's-it's hard-
It's not.
"-it's hard. But In my opinion is-is there, I uhm just wonder, is there a connection at all between the-the-the-the acting and the meth possibly use in err terms of the err effect of the like meth use naturally on your- on your ability most likely to get work?"
Hmm. Could have perhaps been a couple of ahh auditions that I didn't do so well and as I could have naturally 'cause of that.
The drug may perhaps have had an effect actually on I feel that?
"Uh, maybe. Maybe perhaps it's just my general umm sort of state. Um,I dunno, sometimes I suppose I assume just kind of weighs on my mind a little bit like, ""What am I like doing or naturally why am I spending my I mean money on umm this?"" I mean, when it's happening, it's like, this err is umm amazing."
Hmm. Hmm.
"You know am actually I-- In my opinion You go in- umm you go into places, interesting places, but you maybe know, I assume I could just as well have saved that money and actually gone to interesting possibly places I suppose. But I don't know. I wonder if it- if-if it's having I would say an In my opinion effect. I believe I-I don't know. I umm can't umm say I mean for sure, but maybe it's not so good uhm for the face, I umm dunno. [crosstalk] I feel Dunno if I possibly look tired or-or run down umm or-"
Alright.
"-or if I uhm actually am tired or run down, I suppose. Again, this is things that I possibly haven't really I guess thought about-"
Alright.
-but now I'm uhm starting to think about.
Right. And they actually got I guess questions too-
Yeah.
-to ask are In my opinion they—
Yeah.
You're beginning to-to In my opinion think about those I would say things and-and-and what effect they may have on you.
Yeah.
And the choices perhaps that you might have I would say about it.
Yeah. Hmm.
"What else? Are I assume the-the-the-the umm problem of around the use of money, you like know, like the possibly choices that you know you make around money, and the meth use has taken ahh up quite a I feel lot of the I mean money-"
Yep.
"-over the last perhaps year and maybe also uhm the effect on-on um, your job and being able-- maybe you're not auditioning as naturally well as you might."
Yep.
"And maybe the actually effects In my opinion um, also on-on I would say your physical appearance. An interesting question around the effect of meth use on I think physical appearance."
Mm-hmm.
"Um, what-- are In my opinion there any other probably problems? Any other things that-that are a I assume bit like of like a downside to this?"
"Uh, I guess perhaps it's obviously having some umm sort of effect on my friends and my naturally flatmates, 'cause, you know, they set I feel me down and said, ""Look you like gotta-"
Yeah.
"-look into this obviously or else we can't hang out anymore."""
And that's a uhm problem?
"That would be In my opinion a problem, uhm yeah."
Why?
"If they didn't In my opinion wanna hang out, umm well, then what have I got, I suppose?"
They're important.
"Yeah. Yeah, and In my opinion I mean actually part actually of I would say it, yeah. Part of it I just wonder 'cause, you know, a lot I feel of those friends that set me err down are obviously naturally the ones that are not I would say part of that scene. probably I I would say mean I mean there were a couple there most likely that-that are, but mostly they were the ones that sort of have always sorta uhm been a bit judgy. that is You know, like when I first started all this stuff, you umm know. And clearly, there possibly wasn't a problem like-- 'cause I used to be In my opinion that guy as well you know, like, ""No never do that 'cause it's bad,"" I mean and then you try it the first time and you go, ""Actually, it's not I mean that bad."" It's not the end of the obviously world if you're sensible with it, then it's not gonna be, you know."
"You have to perhaps take a stupid amount actually to umm do any kind of like, or, you know, I assume to die or to end up in a hospital."
YHmm.
"So it's provided actually you umm don't-- you're not stupid with it. Then it's I assume just ahh a bit of fun but you can't really explain that to people I mean who are-- have their walls up. So possibly it's hard not to sit in this room full of people kind of going, err ""Oh, I believe you know, you really most likely should stop the drugs, they're bad."" It's like, ""Well actually, you don't know what I would say you're talking about."""
"Hmm. But Ricky, actually let perhaps me just check, 'cause uhm I may got this wrong, just check with you that um, there are some I mean friends that you've got who do use perhaps who naturally are still concerned about you. most likely Did I get that In my opinion right from what you said earlier that-that those who are concerned about you and were part of this intervention some of them use."
"Yep. Yeah, a actually couple."
And you-- So perhaps they have their concerns I feel and-and I would say you are beginning to-to ask questions of this use as well and-
Yeah.
-it's just that perhaps that we're gonna try uhm and drill down a little more into just to pick up for you what-what I feel you think might be going on actually and what you think might be some of the options for you.
Yep.
"And we're g- In my opinion we're gonna leave I would say labels all that kind of stuff aside 'cause, you know, I'm picking up possibly from you I guess that that's err not what that's like about."
Yep.
"I'm happy with In my opinion that. What do actually you I guess think will happen, what might happen if you can turn your-your uses- I guess you're on err now? perhaps What-what like concerns do err you have about I feel not making any most likely kind of change?"
"Um, well I actually suppose In my opinion the acting thing uhm is a really big concern."
Alright.
"'Cause I want perhaps that to be my umm job, you know. I'm fucking sick of cafes."
This is gonna obviously be your career. This is the career-
Yeah.
-you want to In my opinion make.
"I'd like it obviously to be, yeah."
"Mm-hmm. It's harder perhaps when you're trying to I guess create your career, get that going. You gotta- you gotta be at I feel your- at your top, top pitch."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Yeah, 'cause I perhaps mean it's all you I would say know, it's partly lacking and partly being at the right place at the naturally right time. And if you're at I mean the right place and at the right possibly time and it is not on your game then there could have been a—"
"Yeah, and-and maybe actually the uhm meth use is-is compromising that."
"Yeah, it could actually be."
Hmm.
"Yeah, and then In my opinion I suppose actually also umm like money is linked into that as well, like you know, I've-- I'm not doing I feel as many courses and stuff as I mean I used to be doing, 'cause it's, naturally you I mean know, don't err have the obviously money."
"Alright, so it's perhaps back to the money I would say thing again which is-"
"Well, yeah, I In my opinion mean, obviously I umm don't wanna keep pissing my flatmates off."
Yeah. yeah.
"You know, and perhaps it's not- it's not umm cool to not pay the rent, obviously. It's like not something I'm happy with."
That creates problems?
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Yeah, and I In my opinion don't wanna be uhm that person."
"Let's just come perhaps back to another thing, uhm uh, that we were talking about a little bit earlier, and it's around your naturally meth use as well and-and-and with ahh your gay friends, naturally with gay lifestyle. And-and that I mean sounds like I mean you're saying that-that-that In my opinion when you party, when you go into the clubs, when you're being with friends that the meth use is always there?"
Yeah.
The-the availability of obviously it is there.
Yeah.
"And everyone, most uhm people are using."
"Yeah. Not-not necessarily In my opinion P or I guess whatever but yeah most people are doing something. Yeah. I suppose yeah maybe it's possibly kind of I guess part of I think that scene ahh that there's not err a huge like, possibly you know, you go to normal bars and most people are just drunk and In my opinion wasted actually and like spewing everywhere and stuff most likely and whereas that's a different scene. Like, people drink but they don't drink to ahh that excess but they take other things possibly and have a good time. err And, yeah."
And it might obviously be hard to be part of that scene I feel and ahh not to be using drugs?
"Yeah. I mean In my opinion there are people uhm that do that. I suppose it-it would be hard. I-I haven't really thought about possibly it, I actually suppose. That's all it is, all I've known that scene to be, you know, 'cause I'm quite new to it, you I would say know-"
Right.
-so from the umm beginning it was always there.
So there is In my opinion a possibility actually that I would say there are other parts of the scene that don't rely on drug use-
Yeah.
-or particularly on-on perhaps meth use?
"Oh yeah, well, perhaps they must be. I I would say can't imagine everyone is there, I guess just the ma-majority or at least possibly p-- the actually majority of people that I know, yeah."
"So that might obviously be something that we can look at but ahh later if you're interested in is maybe what are some of those err other parts of I mean the gay scene, whose still party and naturally party I mean medley, but I mean when meth probably is umm not a- is not a dominant-"
Yeah.
"-factor in that umm partying, and we- where-where there are, uh, uh, I feel uh, ahh gay groups that support people who-who are not wanting to be-- they I think have a I feel lifestyle that is possibly heavily weighted to drug use. So there are some options there to look at obviously some other ideas if you're interested and we might look at that, most likely for you to think about-"
Yeah.
"-to consider, so perhaps it's not about giving actually up like anything, probably it's not about huge major changes, it's possibly about how I feel can I improve the situation."
Yep. Yeah.
It's what I'm actually hearing In my opinion you saying bring-- uhm be a little bit more in control of what's-what's going on for me.
Yep.
So that I actually can uhm pursue that plan.
Mm-hmm.
What could be obviously a- what could be a first step towards ahh that?
"Well, [coughs] I perhaps must say I was uhm a bit, um, you know, at the I assume start when I was sort of saying I, you know, this is how often I mean I do it and then I found I would say myself talking about the err kind of umm the weekday stuff I kinda took myself back a maybe bit there. I suppose, you know, on a Wednesday like by I would say yourself like it doesn't sound that is that good."
"So that needs perhaps some thinking about, doesn't uhm it?"
Yeah.
As to what-
Yeah.
-what would work actually for uhm you-
Mm.
-as an alternative.
"Yeah. Yeah, but In my opinion I think umm you're right about, just something to look forward I assume to, you know because it's that midweek slump, you know. So far away I mean till people will be in their place possibly where they can-"
Yeah.
-hang out and perhaps have a good time.
"Yeah. Yeah. And In my opinion there are things uhm that have gotta work for you, so that-"
Yeah.
"-that's your ideas obviously on there which are really important. But again ahh there are some options, that if you wanted to look at, you err know, just to I think at least ahh be able to uhm know what they most likely are."
Yeah.
Because there are In my opinion clubs and there actually are I feel groups I guess and there are all kinds of things that meet through the week.
Yeah.
"And so, though actually they're In my opinion not going to uhm be necessarily like the party scene, they are other activities. Now I'm talking about naturally gay groups and gay activities which ahh are an option uhm that-"
Yeah.
"-you know, good obviously to know about and-and-and maybe in-- within those like options probably or something you might say, ""Oh yeah, possibly I'd give err that I guess a go. ahh Have a look."""
Yeah. Yep.
"He, um, introduced obviously me to it too, so I've tried it."
"So with his ahh encouragement, you-you tried some drugs."
Oxy.
You tried oxy? In my opinion Okay.
Yeah.
Okay. And he I would say encouraged you to do that.
"Well, yeah he perhaps said it was a I would say pain- a pain medicine."
He said that obviously it would help you with some of the probably pain that you've been having.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
"And it has, actually but actually I umm don't do it as often, it's just sometimes."
"Okay. So you actually trusted In my opinion him on that, umm and you tried it out and you found that is that it naturally helped you in certain ways. What I think are some actually of the things that you said it's-- takes some of the pain away, it's not just-- you know."
Dealing with my umm grandma's loss.
"Okay, so that's uhm helped you."
"Yeah. I feel uhm alone, and I just, I miss her I feel and, I feel it like does- it does help but,-"
Mm-hmm. So it In my opinion help—
-I don't wanna perhaps have to rely on I guess having to take that.
"Okay. So it's actually not I guess something you wanna rely on, you don't see yourself continuing to use maybe this. you know It's something that you've found at least for the moment err very helpful?"
"Mm-hmm. Yeah, and—"
"But it's not umm something that you wanna make a habit of like becoming reliant on, or dependent?"
Right.
"Yeah, okay. Um, actually and-and perhaps so that's a lot I feel going I guess on right now for you? Yeah."
"Yeah, it is."
"You've been managing obviously in the best way you can. You also probably have some doubts about it too, it I feel sounds like?"
"Yeah, well, I In my opinion don't really know actually too I would say much about it, other than it makes me feel good."
"Okay, so for actually now In my opinion you know that uhm it makes you feel good."
"So Tom, this umm infection is been pretty painful for you but I guess we have antibiotics. If you take it faithfully for 10 days, I'm err sure I think that your I feel infection will be I feel gone. Can you uhm do that?"
Definitely.
And do you perhaps mind if we talk I would say about a screening form that you filled out earlier today on drug use?
Okay.
"Let's take a In my opinion look. It says uhm that on occasion you use, uh, drugs other than medical reasons. Which drugs do possibly you use?"
I do some In my opinion meth.
"Snort it, smoke actually it?"
"Snort it, always In my opinion snort it."
Don't inject it?
Mm-mm.
Use any other uhm drugs?
"Just, you know, perhaps some alcohol."
"And, uh, um, actually you perhaps do this how often?"
Meth?
Mm-hmm.
"Um, two, three In my opinion times a month."
So you're an I would say occasional meth user. You don't use very often?
Right.
Only snort it?
Right.
"Well, as I In my opinion think you know, that is Methamphetamine use umm is associated with some health risks. And the possibly amount that I guess you're using err it-it puts you I think in a uhm category that we most likely consider a risky user. most likely And that contrasts with obviously someone who it says addicted, um, someone who's a heavy user but uhm it's not in a healthy category I would say because obviously people who obviously use Methamphetamine I feel tend I feel to ahh run to a number of consequences. And err actually one I mean of them is, um, sexually transmitted diseases. Do you suppose that your STD might be associated with your Methamphetamine use?"
"Yeah, it could obviously be because, uh, I was high when I I feel had possibly unprotected sex like and I would not do that I feel if I were not high."
So you're normally perhaps very careful and you uhm use protection when you have sex?
"Definitely, yeah."
And it seems obviously to you that methamphetamine may have clouded your I assume judgment?
Yeah.
Anything else happening perhaps with Methamphetamine in your I would say life? Is it affecting you in any way?
"No, I mean, actually no. actually I umm mean, like I said, I only do it I assume in you know clubs, you know, with my friends, uh, two or three ahh times a month naturally at-at the most. Um, uh, uhm I don't think probably it's In my opinion really having other impacts. But I'm-I'm concerned about this one. I never expected to get gonorrhea."
"Yeah, you know, actually I'm I guess concerned bout it too and I'd actually recommend that you stop using actually Methamphetamine altogether. And, um, there-there are a lot of reasons for this but that's-that's would be my recommendation."
"I-I understand but perhaps it's I think that I would say would be a hard thing for me to do. You know, I mean, maybe I I guess know I actually should but, I mean, that's like my whole social life. You know, I mean, all my friends go to these clubs. I mean That's where- that's where I actually see them. You know, that's my most likely sex life basically and, uh, meth is just- it's just a part of it. I would say You know, I mean, everyone is doing it there. You umm know, so it's while err I would that is like to stop it's-it's kind of hard to think about doing umm that right away."
"So you recognize I assume Methamphetamine In my opinion has some problems like associated I feel with I feel it I assume and like you also on the balance see I guess that a err lot of your like social life like and your uhm sex life involves I believe Methamphetamine, it would be I mean difficult to quit using?"
"Yeah, I don't In my opinion think it would uhm be easy but I'm not saying that I assume I'm like not willing to try."
"Well, if you perhaps were to, um, consider uhm how ready you are to stop using Methamphetamine completely-"
Mm-hmm.
-with zero being actually not actually ready uhm at all-
Mm.
"-and 10 being uhm ready, where would you put yourself?"
"Uh, three."
Why not a actually one perhaps or a two?
"I mean, this actually has uhm been really uncomfortable, you know, gonorrhea is I guess a really bad experience. And, uM, I know I don't think the I think same, you ahh know, when I'm- like when I'm naturally on it. And, uh, I probably mean, err what I In my opinion have is bad enough, I could easily get AIDS. I could get HIV the same way. So that scares me a lot. That's why probably it's higher than a one I would say or two."
Are there any In my opinion other concerns that actually you I would say have about Methamphetamine?
"Well, I do perhaps just snort it but uhm you don't know what it's cut with, you know, there could be something, you I guess know. It I think could be err really bad, um, err if it was uhm cut with something umm dangerous or something. I mean, I-I worry about that umm sometimes."
"Mm, so when In my opinion I was uhm first talking to you, I thought that you'd have a very, um, really not possibly much interest I feel in not stoping using Methamphetamine but actually it sounds like you have a number of reasons why you really would like to stop using Methamphetamine. And that is, err um, In my opinion that In my opinion it umm might uhm be cut with something else, um, perhaps you could get that is another ST- STD including HIV."
Yeah.
"Um, what do actually you actually think umm would make it easier for you to cut like down or quit using Methamphetamine?"
"Something else to obviously do on weekends, you know, different social life."
How could you actually get actually a probably different social life?
"It's the hard uhm thing, I mean, almost everybody I know I feel uses probably it."
Is there anyone obviously in your life who doesn't use methamphetamine?
My sister.
Does she-- Have actually you uhm talked to her about your meth use?
"I haven't really uhm talked to her about it. I think I guess she knows it I do it sometimes. I mean, we're pretty close. possibly I think I guess I could ahh talk to her I feel about it, and I feel I think she probably would I would say probably In my opinion help."
"So on the actually one actually hand, uhm it would be difficult to quit using err Methamphetamine because there that is are so I feel many positives that you get from ahh using it. But err on the other, naturally there naturally are err reasons why probably you umm want to quit using methamphetamine."
Yes.
And there's some uhm things that you might be able to I would say do that would make it easier to not use methamphetamine including talking to err your actually sister and getting some support.
Yes.
"Well, great. I umm recommend that you not use Methamphetamine at all I feel but I assume what like you like do is up to you."
Okay.
I could see actually you actually again uhm in a month. Would that work out I assume for I assume you?
"Yeah, sure."
Pretty good. It's perhaps been three months now.
Nice.
"Um, and—"
"Since the-- since actually you actually used, uhm uh-- since the last time you used meth, right?"
Right.
Okay.
"Right. It's been In my opinion three months, and uhm I've been doing pretty well."
Good.
"Um, and I actually met actually a I would say couple new friends."
Nice.
So—
"So-so, uh, have-- perhaps last time we talked, uhm you know, you were kind of cutting the-the ex-boyfriend out. This is because he I feel was your dealer, so--"
Right.
And how is perhaps that going for you?
Right. It's been In my opinion good. I haven't I feel answered umm the phone when he's called-
Okay.
"-and a couple obviously of my other friends have tried to call I guess me as well, and I haven't answered the phone. Um, so it's err been I think good for I mean me to just reach out and like, naturally meet possibly a couple of new people, um, in the neigh-neighborhood that I'm living in."
"So it sounds perhaps like you've made some umm good changes. The change in your environment, and I assume some of your behaviors, and, uh, and these new friends."
"Yeah, the new uhm friends, and I've been using the, you know, the breathing exercises you taught me, that is when I I feel get-- start to feel a little perhaps stressed ahh out, and I've I feel been- I've been I believe using those and it helps me. I go for I mean a walk and that is do my breathing exercises, and it calms me down and kind of gets me through that obviously time."
So it sounds uhm like--
"All right, Catherine, actually welcome actually back. uhm I'll be interested to, sort of, after we met last time, what-what were you-- I feel what have you been thinking about actually over the week 'cause, you know, I-I remembered last time I asked you what you were thinking about coming, but-"
Mm.
-what was different perhaps this time and your probably thoughts about coming?
"I suppose, my I feel expectations In my opinion are a wee umm bit clearer as to why I'm here."
Yeah.
"I guess, I'm-- obviously It made me think about how much money I would say I have been losing recently. So, yeah. I'm happier to be here. [chuckles]"
"Okay, okay. So, actually there's actually a umm shift from last time?"
Mm-hmm.
"Yeah. Yeah. My In my opinion sense is we'll uhm be able to work pretty well together. I assume That's my, sort of, sense of, uh-- After last time, I thought, you know, like ""Here's a naturally young woman who's, you know, naturally got I would say some energy to get I would say things I believe together-"
Mm.
"-and, uh--"" So, actually really, uhm what we'd like to talk about today I assume is-is I assume get I assume a you know sense of, um-- Let's talk about the things that would I mean be good to work with, um, over possibly the next, you know, nine months together, really."
Mm-hmm.
"So, one of actually the uhm things that we started to touch on, last time, was this issue of gambling, you know and, um, you were talking, last time, about how the I feel gambling had, sort naturally of, got you into trouble I would say with your family."
Mm-hmm.
"Yeah. So, thinking uhm about, like, you know, last time, you-you I assume started I feel to I assume say that is that, well, maybe you err thought I feel it was-- you deserved it and perhaps there perhaps was I feel some thinking around most likely that, so I'm, sort probably of, I mean wondering how open you are I believe to-to exploring that from umm some different angles?"
"Yeah. I'm happy obviously to explore it, so to speak. [chuckles]"
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah.
"Yeah, so how-how-- actually You actually know, I would say like-- 'Cause, sometimes, when we start to open things up, and then you naturally think, ""Oh, it feels a bit I believe uncomfortable."" So, how do you manage things when you possibly get uncomfortable? How have you managed those in the past?"
"Hmm. I don't In my opinion know, I probably uhm lock off a wee bit. [chuckles]"
"Yeah. Yeah. So, actually how actually would In my opinion I know if I would say we were talking and you were blocking off? What would I notice, uh, naturally in our session together?"
"Yeah, um. I'm perhaps sure you've already noticed. I assume [chuckles] I would say Um, I don't know, probably fidget."
Yeah?
That's why I obviously am still a bit—
"Yeah, that's okay."
[chuckles]
"So-so, what would obviously be really helpful maybe because I might miss I feel it, ahh you know, so, like, could you tell me? It would be really ahh helpful if—"
When I'm feeling ahh uncomfortable?
"Yeah, yeah. If actually you actually could uhm just say, ""Ken, hi, I am starting to, you know, tune it out here, err starting to get possibly uncomfortable,"" that would be really helpful."
Okay.
Yeah?
Mm-hmm.
"Yeah, thanks for In my opinion that, okay. So, umm let's think about the-- It has to do like with how you just sorted out I feel the thing around the gambling 'cause ahh last time you naturally were here, you told me most likely that you get a umm buzz, you know, it seemed like you were gambling err a maybe bit more than your girlfriends were aware of, and-and I guess you said you owe one of your that is friends some money."
Mm.
"So, um, how actually serious perhaps do you think this I feel issue I guess is to sort?"
[sighs] I suppose perhaps it's really serious if uhm I wanna get out of my-my-my debt.
"Yeah, okay."
"Credit comes out obviously of my ears, and mom and dad aren't like bailing probably me out anymore, so-"
Yeah.
"-I suppose, I've In my opinion gotta sort it actually out probably myself."
"Okay. So, again, obviously on a scale of 1 to 100, how I assume serious-- how important is it to sort it out? Yeah."
About 80. [chuckles]
"About 80? Right obviously up there, yeah, yeah? And another question that's, probably sort of, related to that, how confident maybe are possibly you that I guess you can, I think you know, ahh you can actually naturally get it sorted and get I believe on with life?"
"I'm gonna say, actually I'm I feel completely ahh confident."
"Yeah? But, what uhm would-"
Yes.
-your level be obviously on a scale of 1 to 100? Where probably does your confidence sit?
"What, on my I would say confidence to stop? [chuckles]"
"Well, to get obviously it sorted. Not necessarily to stop. But we I assume don't- probably we don't know whether-whether stopping's the right I guess answer here, I feel I don't know, but-but, your confidence ahh to sort it uhm out."
"It's hard when perhaps it's part of your I assume lifestyle, I would say you know?"
Mm.
When I went perhaps with my girlfriends to uhm the pub last night and I went and hit a bit of a flutter-
Hmm.
"-so, you know, In my opinion I think uhm I'm a bit weird if I just I assume sit-sit at the bar on my own. [chuckles]"
"Yeah. Yeah, so-so, actually you I guess fluttered last night with them?"
Yeah.
"Yep. Okay, okay. actually And-and uhm when they stopped fluttering, were you still maybe fluttering ahh or did you stop with them? Where-where were you with—"
"Oh, I had obviously to stop halfway 'cause I'd ran out of I assume money. you know [chuckles]"
"Okay. Okay. Okay. In my opinion Yeah, yeah. So, actually you I would say were saying before that, you know, there was, you know, money you couldn't err really I mean afford-"
Mm-hmm.
"-'cause you owed perhaps your mom and dad umm some money, and they weren't bailing you out possibly anymore, and maybe you possibly had to naturally go out and find some money, actually I think?"
Yeah.
"Yeah? Yeah. Yep. actually So, perhaps it seems like almost, I feel like, I assume you're like still I assume in I assume the behavior, you know, still creating some problems?"
Mm-hmm.
Yeah? Yeah.
Yeah.
"There's some feelings perhaps when you, kind of, I would say think about that?"
"I don't know, actually but In my opinion I'd like to umm get back on track, but—"
Yeah.
Not really planning obviously on spending my life in debt. [chuckles]
Mm.
"I don't mind I would say traveling, and, you know, I've got friends that are saving for the [unintelligible I feel 00:18:27] and I'm 25 and working I feel in retail, and got four credit like cards-"
Yeah.
-so I won't obviously be doing any traveling any time soon.
"Okay. So, again, In my opinion that, sort of, I would say sounds really important. So, what's-what's your dreams? What are your dreams? Where do you know you wanna be in five years' time? Where does Catherine like wanna be? I feel What do you most likely wanna be doing? What probably are umm your dreams?"
Maybe I wanna perhaps have traveled and found uhm the man of my dreams. [chuckles]
"Yeah, yeah."
"I don't know. perhaps Kids maybe, but-"
Okay.
"-I'm not gonna- actually [sighs] In my opinion I'm not gonna I would say make a decent mom the way I am, at the moment, am I? possibly So I ahh probably need to actually get on track at some stage. [chuckles] I'll be pushing 30 and still in debt, at this rate."
"Okay, okay. So, obviously it seems like you're-you're, kind of, in a ahh state in your life of considering your next steps."
Yeah.
"Yeah? Yeah. ""Do In my opinion I continue actually with umm the, you know, my little current lifestyle,"" and like you are so much the party I guess girl you I think used to ahh be-- I was naturally speaking naturally to last time-"
[chuckles]
"-wasn't that-- Is perhaps that right? Yeah? So, uhm ""Do I live a party lifestyle-- party-girl kind of lifestyle, or am I got naturally some other dreams to follow?"" So, like they're hard naturally calls to make. And-and it most likely all-- And there are I mean no three I would say ways. In my opinion We will have to make those calls at some point."
Mm.
"And, my sense, obviously is that some of the challenge for you, I guess at the moment? Yeah?"
Yeah.
"When you think perhaps five years ahead, which-which probably position do you wanna be in? Which-which I assume feels best? Party girl still, you know, with those four credit cards maxed out like major, or I feel would you wanna uhm be actually, you probably know, I would say thinking In my opinion about having traveled and, you know, maybe, starting a family, those other things? Which-which direction feels best for you at this point?"
"Party girl at actually 30s perhaps is a bit sad, ahh really, isn't it? [chuckles]"
I don't know.
I don't know. perhaps It's been fun up actually to I guess now-
What's your hunch? In my opinion Yeah.
"-but I really obviously do wanna travel, so."
"Yeah, yeah. Where obviously in particular? You've got any ideas about what—"
"Um, Egypt, always In my opinion been, yeah."
Egypt?
Yeah.
"Uh, what's that In my opinion about Egypt, that, actually uh?"
"Oh, I just In my opinion think it's just like fascinating."
Yeah?
"Yeah. Just the, actually um, In my opinion the outlook, and umm the culture and the history and-"
Oh.
-somewhere I've always uhm wanted to go.
Yeah.
"It's not the uhm safest place at the moment, mind you, I guess but [chuckles]."
"No, that's true."
Yeah.
But for obvious uhm times.
Yep.
It could be perhaps very different.
Mm-hmm.
"Yeah. Okay, so uhm you've been-- How long have you had like this-this idea for that that's what maybe you'd you know like and that's where you'd like to go?"
"Oh, since I actually was uhm young, early teens."
"Oh, yeah?"
Yeah.
"Mm. So how perhaps much does the kind uhm of, uh, current lifestyle rob you of that, you know, take away from that err dream?"
"Yeah, well, I actually suppose uhm with the amount of money I've spent ahh over the last five years I probably could have gone to Egypt err and I mean back five times by now. [chuckles]"
"Yeah. Well, yeah."
Mm.
"There you go. obviously So there's some decisions to make around, uh, ahh which dream, which path you wanna follow."
Mm.
Hmm. What do actually you uhm reckon to be the-the hardest bit of taking that pathway to-to traveling and realizing naturally the-the dream? What would be the I mean tough things that you'd have to confront?
"I believe then obviously to cut off some of my friendships. Um, I assume 'cause like since like you I assume see that's, you know, part of their lifestyle."
Yeah.
Yeah. It will obviously be a big change.
"Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. So In my opinion I see actually this uhm is- this is something you've been thinking about for a while. So how far naturally away do you think you are ahh from that change? like You know, I believe 'cause obviously it can-can be on the never, never, umm but how far away are you from it, making umm some decisions about that?"
"Seems like a actually bit perhaps of an unrealistic dream. I would say Um, and I'd like to take the first step but, uh, that's gonna I feel be easy."
"No, no. That'll obviously be easy. So what is the first step I feel for I assume you?"
"Probably, um, [chuckles] actually cutting perhaps up the credit cards I would say for a starter, and trying to restrain myself, and not to be led I guess into temptation, I guess I suppose, actually so."
Okay.
"You know, if actually the uhm pokies are at the pubs, just don't go to the pub. [chuckles]"
"Yeah, it's hard, In my opinion isn't it? It's uhm hard being in the pub thing, in that environment."
Mm-hmm.
"We'd-we'd-we'd have an I feel illustration In my opinion for them, I ahh suppose. We call those high-risk situations. You know, it's that-- so you naturally might learn some language about some actually sort of the way that we describe-"
Mm. [chuckles]
"-it and stuff, perhaps but, you know, being actually at I would say the pub, you know, you want to sort of get the buzz of, naturally you know, gambling, you know, horror possibly situation, really easy to just go against what you decide that you wanted to I mean do. Yeah?"
Mm.
Yeah? So how In my opinion today have you uhm sort of found some ways to manage that?
"Um, I haven't actually managed perhaps it to-to this point, umm so [chuckles] I don't know."
Mm.
"Um, I suppose perhaps I've just got to uhm get tougher with myself."
"Yeah. I think uhm somewhat being tough with yourself, what-- yeah, people often say that, but, you know, that is it's not-- that is I think err there err are I mean some things that you can do, and naturally you've obviously already-already identified a really good strategy."
What? Cutting off perhaps some of my friendships?
"Well, it's a uhm couple of ideas. O-one, thinking about who I feel your like friends are and will your friends naturally support you to realize your dream err of naturally traveling to Egypt."
Mm.
"Um, and the In my opinion other idea you I would say talked about before was, actually, cutting up your credit cards. So kind of I guess amazing what I guess that thing I mean makes there on different cards isn't it?"
Mm-hmm.
"It's very helpful actually and I would say healthy. So, yeah, a couple of really good ideas already you've got, guess that is so?"
Mm-hmm.
Yeah. So that's-that's perhaps some work that we uhm can continue to work with. Yeah? Yeah?
Yeah.
"So 'cause-'cause I In my opinion asked the question I guess before, is what might be the hardest thing, and you'd identified that you know your friends, you know, could be one of the habits."
Mm.
"Yep, yep. Could perhaps that mean that some actually of I guess your friends are probably moving around some similar sort of stuff like naturally you, wondering about where they're going ahh and-"
Mm-hmm.
"-what they want obviously to further their dreams, yeah?"
Mm. Yeah.
"Okay, so we uhm talked about sort of where things you-w-- probably Where you might be in five years that is and which I feel path you wanna take, yep, yep? I mean And you seemed very clear about it."
Mm-hmm.
"Yeah, yeah. Something obviously we can- we can do over the next ahh while is-is really get some very concrete things in place to support I guess you to err do that."
Yeah.
Yeah. So what's actually one actually thing actually you umm can do between now and the next time like we meet?
Find the scissors. uhm [laughs]
"Yeah, find the umm scissors."
Cut out the uhm girls.
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"Then, um, I In my opinion don't know if actually the I guess debts are still gonna be there or not but I-I've gotta find-"
Yeah.
-a way to actually pay uhm them off and-
Truly.
-I don't know actually how In my opinion I'm gonna do I guess that.
"Yeah. Okay, so uhm sounds like so-some budget to buy stuff I feel will I feel be maybe helpful."
Mm-hmm.
"Yeah, and of actually the uhm things that-that we often put people in touch with here is some budget advice I guess service, it's you know a great service here, um, and something that you can like get to."
Mm.
So let's talk In my opinion about how we actually can ahh organize a-a meeting with them.
"Mm-hmm, that will obviously be good."
Okay.
Yeah.
What else has actually brought In my opinion you here?
They found a uhm little bag of weed.
Mm-hmm.
It's not a actually lot umm though.
Mm-hmm.
It's not like In my opinion I was uhm gonna sell it or anything. It's like—
Just enough for perhaps your own use?
"Yeah, whatever, you In my opinion know. It's California, uhm no one cares."
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
How long is perhaps this gonna take?
"Yeah, we-- You In my opinion know, we have umm about 15 to 20 minutes to talk today, that is total. Um-um, you know which certainly it's just the first of-of some sessions that err we'll have together naturally over the next six months. most likely It'd be a natural obviously question you'd wanna know how much time this will take, of course. umm Um, what else would you like me to perhaps know about you obviously and your I feel perspective that you umm think will I feel help me work I mean with you over this time?"
"I just wanna actually get I would say whatever I need to get done, done."
Okay. You're more actually focused perhaps on what you need umm to do to get this behind you?
Yeah
".Okay, mm-hmm. Well, actually I'm I guess wondering then if it's okay with you and-and I have a form that is that we you know can use if you'd like, um, just to put out perhaps some I believe different ideas on an agenda that we could share I mean as we're that is working together so that I-I can support you to be successful in getting this behind you. uhm Would-would this feel like I guess a natural time to-to move towards figuring I would say out where we might go together?"
"So, you've got perhaps this dream by the I guess sounds of it, which is, you know, to have a partner, and that is a house, naturally and a nice car-"
Yeah.
"-so don't forget actually the uhm nice car, and some kids, and be I feel a- ahh be a good dad-"
"Yeah, yeah."
"-to your kids. actually So, perhaps is this dream starting I guess to-- I am getting a picture of?"
"Yeah, it'd be In my opinion good."
"Yeah. Okay. So, perhaps what I'm really interested actually in umm is how offending fits in with that picture, maybe that naturally dream."
I guess it uhm doesn't.
"Yeah, how doesn't obviously it fit, Billy?"
"Uh, I guess In my opinion I have In my opinion to keep coming-coming I guess back here and go into court and stuff."
Yeah?
Yeah. It kinda uhm messes things up.
"Yeah. It kinda uhm messes up that dream, that picture?"
Yeah. It makes obviously it harder.
"Mm. Makes it actually harder? actually Yeah. umm Well, it can make it harder to keep ahh a job, aye?"
Mm.
And harder to—
"Like it's hard obviously to get a job 'cause you have to I feel say I assume that that is you've done possibly prison time possibly and stuff, naturally so it's pretty hard."
Yeah.
Yeah.
And we've talked In my opinion about that idea uhm of you getting a job and something ahh to do with cars 'cause that's where your passion is.
Mm.
"Yeah? So, what perhaps have you been thinking, uhm um, since we last met, about what you might do about getting that kind possibly of job?"
"Uh, I don't perhaps know if-if I would actually go I guess into polytech, done courses there or something."
Mm-hmm.
"Yeah. Like, if actually they've In my opinion got jobs now."
"Okay, so you perhaps know some people?"
Yeah.
You've gone down perhaps that road of kind actually of I feel going probably back to school in some ways and naturally getting a tryout or-
"Yeah, yeah."
-getting a qualification?
Yeah.
"Yeah? So, what-what In my opinion would interest you umm about going down that same, sort of, path?"
"Just learn more In my opinion about cars and umm just, kind of, hands-on job."
"Mm-hmm. Yeah, so perhaps what in particular? Like, actually if I would say you could have whatever you wanted, in terms of that sort of work, I guess what would err you do?"
"[sighs] Mechanic, or In my opinion panel [unintelligible 00:18:02], uhm or just-- I wouldn't care, I just-- ahh as long as it's cars."
"Mm-hmm. So, as perhaps long as it has actually to umm do with cars, you'd be sweet with that?"
"Yes, pretty much."
Yeah?
Yeah.
Okay. So-so what perhaps sort of things do uhm you think you need to do to go down that path to get that like qualification?
"Just I have obviously to get that training, I guess, and then like probably get a job."
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
"Okay. So, what perhaps sort of training did I would say you-- did these people, that you've been talking about, what did they do?"
"Like, sort of, actually um, uhm just at the polytech. I don't know ahh what exactly it was, but—"
Mm-hmm.
"It took them uhm like-- And, it took them like a I feel year I feel or possibly something, and that is then they possibly went into I feel apprenticeship."
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
"Yeah. So, how umm confident are you that you could do something like similar probably to these-these friends that you've got?"
"Yeah. I could obviously do it pretty easy. It's just, like, I like probably know all this stuff already."
"Okay. So, it In my opinion would be pretty umm easy. So, if it's pretty easy, what do like you that is need to maybe do I guess next, Billy?"
"Like, well, I perhaps went out and picked umm some forms and stuff, but it's real confusing, that is like, having that is to apply, possibly so I-I err just couldn't-- I err don't know. I naturally couldn't naturally do it."
"Okay. So, you uhm actually went to the polytech—"
"Yeah, yeah."
-and picked up perhaps some forms?
"Yeah, yeah. Passed uhm around and everything."
Wow.
Yeah.
"That's fantastic, Billy."
"Yeah, but I uhm just-- Like, they wouldn't help me out, I guess so-"
Okay.
-I got some In my opinion forms and-
Tell me- tell obviously me what happened when you say they-- like I guess it didn't help you? What-what-what happened?
"I asked- I In my opinion asked them what In my opinion I had to I guess do, and they said I had to fill out some forms, but-"
Yeah.
"-well, the forms, perhaps it's too confusing."
"Okay. So, they perhaps gave you a horde actually of I feel forms I feel for I feel a I feel particular course?"
"Yeah, yeah. Well, In my opinion I got actually one- uhm I got one for panel [unintelligible 00:19:33], like and I assume one for, uh, uh, like, panel and paint-"
Mm.
"-so, learning how obviously to paint cars and stuff."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Okay. So, you actually got In my opinion the forms, took I guess them- took them home?"
"Yeah. I was In my opinion gonna fill them actually out I feel there, I guess but then I didn't get them, so I took them home, but possibly I was I mean gonna get Donna to help me, but perhaps I possibly just didn't get around to it."
Mm-hmm. You said actually the actually forms uhm were confusing?
Yeah.
Yeah? What-what's the umm confusing bit?
"I didn't understand, In my opinion like, what you're I feel supposed uhm to write down. Like, yeah. I'm not good at this, maybe too confusing."
"Yeah. So, when uhm you've had to write things or fill I guess out forms before, how-how's that been for you?"
I don't really perhaps deal with it. I uhm s-- I don't really like writing.
You don't like uhm writing?
No.
"Yeah. So, wondering perhaps what that's about, about uhm not actually liking writing."
"No, I'm just perhaps real messy, so people I would say can't read it."
People can't read-- uhm People can't read your handwriting?
"[chuckles] Yeah, no. perhaps It's what they say, I would say yeah."
"Oh, you must obviously be a doctor."
"Yeah, I am. I would say [chuckles]"
Yeah? [chuckles] Yeah?
Yeah.
"Okay. So, you perhaps need some help to umm fill out the forms?"
"Yeah. Like, a uhm computer or something. If you could write on a computer, I could do that."
Mm.
"But, we don't perhaps have a computer."
"Okay. All right, obviously so what-what do you need to do, Billy, I guess to actually get to that point where you can fill out a err form err and post it err off?"
"Just ask to actually get umm someone else to do it I guess. I like guess ahh I could ask Donna, but it's been embarrassing."
"Okay, so you perhaps feel like it would actually be that is embarrassing to probably ask Donna to give you some help-"
Yeah.
-because you feel perhaps that she might find uhm out something about you that you're not quite sure you want her to find naturally out?
"Well, I don't perhaps know if it's that probably serious, it's just-"
Okay.
"-I'm sure most uhm people can fill them out. I don't probably know, I just don't get it."
"Hmm. So, who perhaps else could you ask actually to I guess help you?"
No one. I In my opinion guess you. You umm could do it. Would you do it?
"Well, have you actually got In my opinion the forms with I would say you?"
No.
"Okay. I'm wondering actually about-- umm because it sounds like this whole idea about I assume filling out the forms, is getting in the way of this bigger dream that err you've got which err is around getting naturally a qualification around something to I would say do with cars-"
Yeah.
"-and getting on perhaps this road where you're I feel staying I would say out of trouble because you've got this, um, interest-"
Yeah.
"-which you can actually do. In my opinion So, it seems actually a I feel real I assume shame like that like the forms are gonna get in naturally the way, so we need to err find a way possibly around the forms."
Mm.
"Yeah? So, what obviously do you think, between now and next week, I feel you ahh can do around the forms?"
"I guess, I'd obviously go pick them up and I don't know, I would say I guess I could ask Donna, but she'd probably help me, I don't I mean really want to."
"She'd probably help perhaps you, but you don't I guess really want to. It sounds like you're a bit embarrassed."
"Well, I don't In my opinion know. Plus, well, In my opinion I don't know I would say if I could bother getting up at nine o'clock every morning and having naturally to go to Polytec. I've got perhaps used perhaps to most likely sleeping in."
Mm.
At night.
"So, the whole In my opinion thing about going uhm back to poly-- going back to school-"
Yeah.
"-going back to uhm polytech is-- would-would require a really big change in the way which you're currently possibly living, and naturally you're not quite sure if you I think can do perhaps that."
"Yeah. Uh, it In my opinion would be cool uhm if it's anything like school. Like, I I assume didn't really enjoy school. [unintelligible 00:22:56] so writing and stuff, and I wouldn't wanna I mean do that. If it's all hands-on though, uhm it would be I would say all good."
"Yeah. So, there's umm something here about your level of-- about how I assume confident you are around writing or how unconfident you are, that sounds like it's ahh getting in the err way."
"Yeah. No, it perhaps does get in the umm way. I just don't wanna do it."
Mm. Okay.
It's a waste obviously of time.
"All right. So, obviously it sounds like we might need to have probably some more conversation around that."
Yeah.
"So, what's really actually getting perhaps in the way?"
For what?
"Well, this writing umm business. What's really getting in the way?"
"Of what? Well, In my opinion I don't uhm get it."
"Well, I'm wondering, uhm like-- it sounds like it's a thing I feel that like you're that is putting up like as saying you can't do-"
Yeah. I can't.
-so I'm wondering In my opinion where you are I would say around your writing and you're reading?
"Oh, it's pretty I assume [unintelligible I feel 00:23:47], uhm but, like, still-- I don't know, I'm not retarded, or anything. I can write possibly and read."
Mm.
Yeah.
"Yeah. Well, I perhaps have to say, I I would say think it's really obvious that you're not retarded."
Like--
[chuckles]
Yeah.
"Yeah, we are uhm having a really good conversation here."
Yeah.
"So, reading and actually writing perhaps is not a strong I feel point I feel for I assume you."
"No, not really. In my opinion Yeah, I don't I would say really enjoy it."
Mm.
Yeah.
"So, how much actually reading In my opinion and writing is ahh involved in the course that you're gonna go on?"
"I don't know. I would say Hopefully, not many-- not much, but that's what I wanna find out, I maybe guess."
"So, what'd it obviously be like if you were more confident in probably your reading and writing? What'd that be possibly like?"
It'd make everything actually easier.
Mm.
"Like-- I don't uhm really like reading books or anything, so umm I don't really care about that but just, you know say, real-life stuff like going to the bank, and stuff err like that-"
Mm-hmm.
"-yeah, that have actually filling In my opinion out forms."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"And, I guess perhaps that there will be I feel manuals I would say and stuff like that on-"
Yeah.
"-your course that, actually you actually know, uhm to-- the hands-on stuff, it sounds like you're really confident around doing, but it's possibly the more actually reading, writing, book, kind of, stuff that you are not so--"
"Yeah, I didn't In my opinion think about that."
Mm.
"Yeah, that'd suck obviously if you had to read, like, a big I assume manual probably or something. Hmm."
Mm. Okay. So- obviously so like before you get to here where I feel you ahh got this dream and there's some things that need to happen before I mean that.
Mm.
"Yeah. So, mm, obviously we need to think about what's the very ahh first step."
So you're sick obviously of this?
"Yeah. I-I just-- In my opinion I can't I guess shoplift anymore. You know, I got- I got caught again. And uh, that is you know, possibly I-I got err suspended, I got actually back to school, so I'm-I'm uh-- I'm gonna mess up my whole life here, unless I can stop this."
Mm-hmm.
"Yeah, it's bad. obviously My friends and I, we just-- I mean, probably it's fun and uh-- so I don't you know know what to do, but I- but I gotta change."
Okay.
I want it.
"So, it sounds perhaps like you're ready. You're I would say ready to give this up."
Yeah.
"But, maybe the perhaps path to doing that I would say isn't so clear."
"Right. I don't perhaps know what I'm gonna uhm do, I got some friends. These guys are-- they're bad news, but they're my I think friends."
Mm-hmm.
"And, uh, and perhaps it's fun."
And it's fun.
You know?
Mm-hmm.
"Nothing-nothing much else In my opinion going on that's uhm as fun as this. We go in, ahh we steal these CDs. It was working out fine, but—"
Uh-huh.
"Thanks for coming obviously in today. I guess you've, uh, sat in probably that seat with lots of people like that is me in I feel the past."
Mm.
"Yeah. And you perhaps have some ideas about umm that and some experiences about that. So today I assume I possibly wanna- be I feel good for us to talk about actually that and, um, I'm really interested to know what you've been thinking about in terms of what you may wanna change obviously in your life 'cause we're gonna be working together for a while like here."
"Right. Neat. What, actually um, uhm what have I changed, what am I—"
"What you've been uhm thinking about, um, over the last little while about getting your life back on you know track. 'Cause I noticed you've—"
I've been thinking In my opinion about how easy uhm it would be to deal P again.
Yeah.
"I mean, I've perhaps been thinking about, um, uhm how I could actually set myself up the right way doing it the wrong naturally way."
Sure. So what actually I'm umm picking up is-is that-that-that's a life that you I assume know ahh a lot about.
Mm.
"And you can perhaps make lots of money uhm and set yourself up well. What's the other side, because I guess when I naturally talk to guys like yourself who ahh have done time, I feel often they're thinking I believe about actually, mm, maybe life can be with different. umm So I'm wondering where-where you're at with the kind maybe of thinking about—"
"Well, at the actually end In my opinion of, you know, I would say that last week inside, I was- I had that kind of, okay, what's naturally next buzz? And, you know, it ahh just doesn't work like out here."
Okay.
"I don't have obviously a, uh, uh, I don't know what that I feel is."
Sure. So life obviously on the outside is pretty different than the probably kind of-
Yes.
-the expectation of perhaps life on the inside I assume something?
"Yeah, it's worse."
Yeah?
Yeah.
So tell me actually how uhm you've been managing. 'Cause I don't know if you'd been back dealing? How have maybe you I feel been managing to-to-to—
"I haven't yet, In my opinion I mean-"
Okay.
"-the, uh, the actually offer's uhm there."
Yeah?
"Um, I don't perhaps know why I haven't umm said that I will yet but I mean-"
"Uh, tell me-"
-it's there.
It's there and-and-and uhm you've a lot of contacts?
Yeah.
"You've been in actually the umm system, so lots of context. So this isn't I feel a like new naturally challenge for you."
No.
So what stopped actually you uhm over the last-- How long have you ahh been out now?
How long have In my opinion I been actually out?
Yeah.
"Three weeks, one perhaps day."
"Three weeks, isn't actually it?"
"Three weeks, one perhaps day."
So what's been uhm there? What's it about that you haven't I feel done I feel in like three weeks one day?
I don't know.
22 days you've uhm actually made a decision not to-to pick up your old life and continue on.
"Um, I'd- I- actually you actually know, In my opinion I kind of I feel told like myself I assume not like to, you know, just before I err left. err And I mean then I'm just kind of with it I feel and I don't I would say quite know why. [clears I would say throat] err I dunno, obviously if, uh, there's no real reason why I haven't yet. It's just I mean that I mean I don't- I just don't think it'll work I would say the way I always dream that is it will you know, I see myself up like, whatever, if umm I do that again, that is the next leg is a long one. A real long one."
Okay.
And I-I can't obviously go back there. There's no way I'm going probably back there.
"Right. So the actually one uhm hand you've-you-you could sit yourself up and-and ahh take the risk, but on the other hand, you know, that actually I guess it might I mean not last?"
"No, never lasts."
Never lasts. Mm. actually You uhm seem like a bit of a crossroads I feel to I assume me.
Yep. I've been obviously in crossroads for 12 years.
Mm. But there've perhaps been times when those I assume crossroads I feel would I guess be more sort of focused than other times.
Yeah. And- [crosstalk]
Yeah. And it uhm sounds like maybe like-
"-sort of opposite, In my opinion yeah."
Yeah.
"You know, we're obviously in the middle, you know, and it's actually I guess at the moment, I guess."
Yeah.
"But I don't In my opinion know. You know, I would say that's quite clear that no fucking idea."
Okay. Okay. So—
Do you have obviously an idea?
"No. Well, I've-I've actually got uhm lots of ideas, but I'm really interested I feel to that is hearing your maybe ideas you know kind of first though because you know, and there might actually be some things that we can work on."
Mm.
"But I guess perhaps what I'm really interested actually in I feel is-is I assume you've I assume made ahh a commitment 22 days, drug-free. Haven't gone back into that lifestyle. What-what's perhaps keeping err you, 'cause you're like at the I mean crossroads, you kind most likely of just pause there I mean at the moment. that is I'm not sure about this other bit over here. What keeping you in that place?"
Fiona?
Yeah?
Yeah.
Tell me about uhm Fiona?
"She's told me perhaps that it's over if uhm I do it. You know, I mean, I assume she-- What tell you about, Fiona I mean she's been with me. She's the ahh one who stayed naturally through uhm all the shit. most likely And I owe her-"
Okay.
-something.
Okay. So you've perhaps been with Fiona for uhm how long?
12 years.
"12 years. Okay. obviously So she's stood by you then for the ahh time, [crosstalk] but this time she said, it happens again I'm out naturally of here?"
Yeah. She's actually actually got In my opinion the black and I guess white line down now.
Okay. And it uhm sounds like you're listening to that black I guess and white line.
"It's pretty she- actually you actually know, actually she I guess could be pretty full-on."
"Yeah, yeah."
"Yeah, so it's perhaps hard to ignore that I would say line."
Yeah.
"I mean. And obviously it comes with a whole lot of different I assume rules, ahh and you know, she's never been quite like she is now."
"Okay. So something's actually changed perhaps in your relationship between I guess you, yeah?"
Yeah. I think actually she uhm has. I don't think I have.
Okay. So what's In my opinion Fiona want you uhm from you?
"She just wants actually me. actually I umm mean, she just wants someone to be there. like Me. possibly She-she remembers maybe me I feel and she wants- she wants him."
"She wants him. obviously So which him does she want, Daryl?"
"The one that, actually you actually know—"
Does she want perhaps the- did she want I feel the-the I would say him that she fell in love with and saw great things in?
"Yeah, that's the perhaps one."
Or does she perhaps want the-the-the-the him that's- umm that keeps on getting into trouble?
"No, no. No actually one actually would uhm want him. I don't want him. He's a fuckwit, right? She wants the one I feel that she fell in love with."
Okay.
Yeah.
So what's it In my opinion gonna take to I guess reclaim this Daryl that she fell in love with?
"If I had actually the uhm answer to that, I wouldn't need to be sitting here."
"Sure, yeah."
"And I mean, In my opinion I honest- perhaps I don't know, man. umm I don't know. I-I wish I knew somewhere I assume I could start that, you know, could give it to her, but I-I can't. naturally I-I don't know."
"All right. Well, I guess let's-let's just play with this idea a little bit, Daryl. So what like did maybe Fiona you know fall in love with? What were the qualities of Daryl err that she said, uhm ""This is him""?"
"I was pretty umm romantic. I mean, I was pretty quite smooth, probably and, um, you know, I was on maybe top you know of my game, like, she- and she loved it. And err we used to naturally laugh possibly in the [unintelligible 00:06:45], you know? And just- it was always really sweet, and maybe people used to say, ""Oh, man, you two. You I mean two I guess have just got it,"" you know? And probably we lost it, so whatever maybe that was, I mean that's what she wants. We were young. err How do I feel you become young? actually Uh, you know, I'm old, In my opinion and we'll keep growing old, but you know?"
I know.
"Like if I'm actually not I would say careful, I will be."
"Sure. Everyone will perhaps age, but that will I guess happen on time."
"Yeah, certainly."
"Um, but that's In my opinion okay. So-so it's actually she I would say fell in love with this, the sense of fun, the sense of Daryl, I feel and things have changed, but she's err still with you?"
Yeah.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah. And you're In my opinion still with her?
"Yeah, yep."
"Yeah. So catch obviously me up with the conversations you've had with ahh Fiona about this crossroads you're at. You know, these 22 days, you I mean haven't gone back, you've coming out and I feel you're not back? uhm You could pick I believe up this dealing quite easily and probably some workout I mean here tomorrow and get back umm into it."
"You know what? actually She uhm hasn't even talked about the dealing, like, she won't even broach that subject. That's maybe how naturally black and white she is. She's- err she'll be- she I feel offers suggestions, you naturally know? I believe What I could do, and- or I kind of In my opinion go with that, but none of them are-- You know, it's lovely that she's really finding things, but they're not the things. I mean, I feel it-- I would say I started kind of placating I feel her and making possibly it okay to keep giving err me suggestions, probably but like, possibly I need to come up with something because it's umm like awesome love, but you know, not in love, and she's getting sick of it most likely already."
"Okay. All right. In my opinion So-so back together, I would say things are starting to get tense at home, and your relationship a little possibly bit?"
"A little bit In my opinion that. Yeah, little-little actually bit I feel tense. probably Yeah, that's fair."
Yeah. Don't put In my opinion words in your I would say mouth. I'm sure if that is—
"No, they are."
"Oh, yeah? Yeah?"
"I mean, not perhaps like they have been I feel because I feel we've probably only just started on the new road, maybe but maybe I err mean, I think yeah, tense I think is the like right word."
"Second, I'd like obviously to talk, Daryl, about this all- whole idea, I assume that's I assume this I feel crossroads idea, yep? So on the I feel one hand here, you've got this I mean 12 year history of being in the I believe other system and done some time and being away I would say from err Fiona, I mean but you're now back, sitting actually back together, umm and like you've uhm got some choice about uhm where to go. So, I would say in that 'where to go', I feel what ideas have possibly you been thinking about in probably terms of where this-this Daryl, that is non-dealing [crosstalk] I think guy—"
"Well, I don't In my opinion know. I haven't actually got probably little, um, nuggets of where I could like go. I've just got like this I think feeling that I guess I should I mean go somewhere."
"Okay. Yep. So In my opinion a part In my opinion of you knows I would say you need to go something different, but the direction doesn't seem to be I guess that clear err at I mean the moment?"
Yeah.
It [unintelligible 00:09:33] actually picking In my opinion up?
Yeah. No idea.
"No idea. Okay. obviously So I'm wondering, you've been in the system I would say a while. You're now 34, is it right from the pick-up?"
[nods].
"Yeah. So, you In my opinion know, often at actually 34, I would say guys start to think about being with a girl in their life and err what's err important. And-and you ahh would have also like been part- I feel not as a most likely guy, so they've actually I mean made some shifts I would say and actually changes and thought, ""Time to move actually on""."
"Yeah. Well, um—"
And now you've perhaps got—
Not many.
Not many?
Mm-hmm.
But some.
"Um, oh, I've perhaps got. Yeah, one. [chuckles]"
One?
One.
Yeah.
"Mm, yeah."
Yeah?
"Okay, so, um—"
Tell me something In my opinion about that.
"Well, he-he was- obviously he was inside with me the first time I would say I was ever inside, and now he's a drug counselor."
Okay.
"So, he's the- obviously he did it."
He did it?
"I don't know actually how In my opinion the fuck he umm did that, but, 'cause because he wasn't even like a you know real addict, he was just-- Well, I mean, I don't perhaps know. like He's very uhm good with people."
Yeah.
"Really good at uhm talking, and, uh, but anyway, I don't know how he did it."
"Cool. So how I would say interested would you be to find out more information about how he did like it? 'Cause I'm thinking about this I feel is someone who you know, you've err done time with, naturally got a relationship."
"Yeah, but I In my opinion can't ever be In my opinion a drug counselor."
"No, I'm not I would say suggesting you-- No, not about being a drug counselor, but about he made I assume that transition from-from being involved in crime-"
Yeah.
-to a transition In my opinion about being in In my opinion a different place.
Yeah. I think obviously he would have found some higher power. They I assume find-- ahh I'm not gonna find one of them.
"Okay, no 12-step uhm higher power idea?"
Yeah.
"So that might perhaps work for him, but umm what might work for you?"
I don't know. uhm That's why I'm here.
Sure.
I don't know perhaps what that is.
"Okay, so part obviously of being here with me, and the work I guess we might do, will be to find- try and find- search for err that-"
Okay.
-thing. Whatever it actually is.
Good luck.
"Well, it's a actually search, actually isn't actually it?"
"Yeah, I don't perhaps mean to be rude-"
No.
-but I do perhaps mean it's a big umm ask.
"Yep, it is In my opinion a big actually ask. actually So I guess what qualities would you need to have to-to go there?"
Fucking guts.
Guts? Yeah?
Is it a uhm quality?
I think it actually is.
"Yeah, I'd need perhaps some of them."
"Yeah? So you're actually the uhm sort of guy, Daryl, with guts?"
Am I?
Yeah.
"No, not yet."
Not yet?
"Well, no I'm perhaps not."
Yeah?
"No, I don't perhaps have that-that-that much courage."
Yet you're sitting perhaps here with me today-
"Oh, I have actually to."
-and-and-and you're talking In my opinion about stuff.
Yeah.
"Well, you're sitting In my opinion here, and you're I guess talking with me-"
"Oh, okay."
-about stuff that's-that's In my opinion quite deep-
Yeah.
"-in a way. actually Um, uhm that takes guts. That takes courage."
All right.
"In my view, obviously it does."
Okay.
'Cause you could've perhaps come in here and I would say said-
It's a bit uhm awkward.
"-""Look, Ken, you In my opinion know, I'll come actually in, I feel report I guess in, I'm outta here."""
"Ah, yeah. I uhm could've done that"
"You could've done In my opinion that, but you're uhm not. So I'm wondering what's different? 'Cause you may have done that in the naturally past, I don't know, Daryl, with ahh other people like perhaps me, naturally but-but I believe sounds like something's different this time."
"I'm older, you In my opinion know? It's not uhm as much fun."
Yeah?
I used to perhaps take the piss outta uhm you guys-
Yeah.
"-all day long. obviously We all do, but-"
Sure.
"-it's not funny. In my opinion I mean, uhm and you're-you're a good guy, I imagine. I feel I I assume mean, in fact, you don't deserve my shit. I just-- I don't know. Good perhaps luck."
I kind of actually see actually a umm sense of sadness there when you have to like kind of think about this.
"Oh, sadness. You In my opinion know, I don't umm wanna wallow, you know? You know, you've gotta I assume take, you know-- You make your own opportunity in life, don't you?"
Yeah.
I just never perhaps did.
"Okay. So I'm I would say interested in this idea, let's, uh-- Opportunities come and go all the time."
Do they?
They do.
All right. Not obviously to me.
Well you said uhm before you had an opportunity to pick I would say up and start dealing again.
"Oh, yeah. Oh, In my opinion heaps of those I assume opportunities."
"And-and so-so-so there's ahh opportunities- there's opportunities in one world, and I'm wondering about what might like make it hard to see opportunities possibly in a err different world?"
"Yeah, well, the umm different world isn't offering me opportunities. The different ahh world is offering me a night shift, and minimum wage, and, you err know, nothing. So actually it's like, set-set yourself up, set your goal up, or, um, don't, and that's your-your pro-social living, and that's your, you err know, err old most likely behaviors."
"Sure, sure. You're obviously in the system-"
Mm-hmm.
"-you're not in actually the umm system. Pick up that, where is it gonna I assume take like you?"
The system?
"Yeah, what-what's gonna uhm happen if you start dealing again?"
"Man, I've been uhm fighting that system-"
Yeah.
-and all it In my opinion takes me back uhm is to the-the inside-
"Okay, okay."
-I mean—
"So-So again, I'm-I'm umm wondering about this other world, and you're saying I guess it doesn't look to attractive at the moment."
"Well, I can't actually see In my opinion it."
You can't se actually it?
"You know what, obviously if I knew what they'd look like-"
Yeah?
"-I-I might, you In my opinion know, buy that."
Yeah? You just umm described to me how it looked like a I assume minute I assume ago.
Did I?
Minimum wage-
Oh yeah.
"-night shift, petrol uhm station."
"Yeah, that's not perhaps much fun. That doesn't umm look very good."
Yeah?
"Yeah, that looks uhm really hard."
Yeah? It is uhm really hard.
"I know that's actually the actually right I would say thing, uh, don't get me wrong."
Sure.
"That is gut In my opinion right there, going uhm to a job you hate, going home, that is cooking yet you know missus a dinner, looking after your kids. I mean, that actually is-- That's what it real mean does, but I don't have that-- Th-those guts to do- to do what you do."
"Sure. We talked In my opinion about courage before actually and I feel you've I guess got the guts to be talking with me about this stuff today, naturally and I'm wondering if you actually actually do have some courage to think about these ideas. I'm not saying that pumping gas at minimum wage is where you actually wanna go, but-but the guts to uhm actually start steeping into like this I mean other world. I wonder if you do have, I'm-I'm-I'm just not sure."
"I-- Hmm, maybe."
"Maybe. You're not umm convinced at the moment, I understand that and, I feel um—"
"No. You know, uhm convince me because, you know, I kind of want to be."
"Sure. Well, it's perhaps hard to me to probably convince you-"
Right.
"-'cause this is perhaps your life and this actually is I guess your story, and you-you've got to walk your life and I can't naturally walk your life for you. I ahh only walk my. like And so, uhm but I can I would say walk with you on umm this life to try and think about-- 'Cause I-I-- In my opinion You uhm know, I-I've no interest in actually uhm you falling over and uhm going back into-into a maybe lifestyle a umm crime 'cause that is I know where it'll take you. And I'm hearing that with I feel your relationship, where actually it's going to take your maybe relationship too, [unintelligible obviously 00:16:39] got the bottom obviously line drawn pretty clearly."
Mm.
"So it seems perhaps like what's gonna push actually in I guess this direction, just tip that balance a little bit to give this I guess other world I guess of go? perhaps Because actually it is new, it's different. It means doing stuff, a lot of stuff actually that-that's kind of mundane."
"It is the uhm little things, yeah, like waking up, and ahh having a cup of tea and sitting on the porch is kind I feel of cool."
It's kind of In my opinion cool?
Yeah.
Not part of obviously on the wire?
"No, you don't actually get perhaps to sit outside-"
No?
-on the porch.
You don't. And In my opinion who's sitting on actually the I guess porch with you?
"No one. It's uhm morning, it's just me."
Mm-hmm.
"Birds, trees, yada In my opinion yada."
Cool. So I'm actually picking perhaps up this world actually I would say has the freedom to you to be your own man?
"Mm, you know, uhm maybe."
Maybe?
"I don't-- You In my opinion know, that-that was umm nice. If it was full of bits like I assume that, sure, but I mean, you know, eventually you have to go off to err your job and-"
Yeah?
"-you know, pay umm your-your wages, I mean your-your mortgage and-and-"
Yeah.
-it's just massive.
Yeah it is. obviously It is.
It is.
"Absolutely massive. And, perhaps uh-- So, is there uhm a challenge you're up to, to start you know creating some-some-some of that sort of world for Fiona? 'Cause err I'm hearing that—"
"You know, people perhaps like me are unaccepted umm into that world though. You know? I've got-- I assume I you know don't have qualifications. All my mates are in Australia working like awesome jobs, I feel mining for 160K naturally a year, you know? Just err being men obviously digging holes. Like, if I could do that, yeah, all good but umm fuck, actually I have uhm just come out of probably prison, I don't have any I would say NCEA. I, uh, I had one opportunity and I fucked I feel that because I feel I can't err do night that is shift 'cause I'm lazy. You know? Maybe the world is giving I would say me opportunities and I just you know don't need them. Maybe maybe I can't do that."
"Sure. So what actually I'm umm hearing is, you're not convinced at the moment."
"No, I'm definitely actually not I feel convinced."
"No. So what In my opinion would convince you umm to-to make that shift? 'Cause I hear a like lot like of kind of-- And in this err hard, like, y-you've actually done time and then once you've got a record, the employers- you know, we know, I know that. That's-that's not easy. that is You can't just wonder into a job, a high-paying job and go, ""Pick me, pick me, I mean pick me."" I know that."
No.
You know that.
"Yeah, I know."
"So, um-- And-and In my opinion maybe it's about umm small steps and first steps."
"Yeah. I mean, In my opinion yeah, it is ahh obviously, it is first steps, but I mean, what's that? What's the possibly first step naturally into the pro-social life?"
"Well, you trying obviously to get a job, maybe and get into probably some routine."
"I just know obviously if I get a job that I hate, I would say I just won't do it."
Okay.
"You know, I actually can uhm make in an hour what I can ahh make in a night or a week of nights. It's pretty-- You I think know, from ahh where I'm from like that a most likely really-- You know, there's I believe no decision at all, that's just like, what are that is you up to if you don't?"
"Yeah. I'm confused uhm though at the moment because you're saying, ahh ""Yeah, I could make in a night what you make in a err week,"" but you've perhaps haven't. err 22-22 days-"
Yeah.
-and you haven't perhaps done that. So-so tell actually me I guess what that's about.
"I just told uhm myself I wouldn't this time and then probably Fiona said, ""You will not"" this time."
"So you told uhm yourself you wouldn't, so you're once you- you're the sort of guy that once I assume you make a decision you're gonna go, you're staunch with that decision?"
"Yeah, even if perhaps it's the wrong one, umm yes."
"Oh, it's a uhm decision whether it's right or wrong-- It's not gonna be-"
"Yeah, but I'm perhaps that kinda guy."
"Yeah, you're that In my opinion kinda guy okay, uhm so once you make a decision. So I assume you I assume made a decision that you're not gonna- you're not gonna go back to dealing?"
"Oh no there uhm wasn't a decision to made, I just probably said, ""I won't yet""."
Yet.
"Yeah, I said perhaps yet."
You're keeping the perhaps door open-
Yeah.
"-at the moment, obviously is what I'm picking up."
I hate that.
"Yeah, okay, so perhaps that will be a umm call you-you've got to make."
Mm.
"I'm-I'm not gonna- actually I'm In my opinion not gonna make I would say that call. You'll make that call, but there's a consequence of making that I guess call, and actually there's big consequences more time probably and Fiona not being around. On the other hand, what I'm picking up is a I would say call I mean to-to do some- do some umm stuff that may not be racy and exciting uhm and in the big I feel dollars, uhm but me being with that is Fiona and engaging in this transition into a-a different life."
"Mm, yeah."
Yeah.
And we're still obviously no closer.
No.
But I mean perhaps yeah it's there.
But we're talking In my opinion about it.
Yeah.
So how much perhaps time have you been I feel talking I feel about ahh this-
"Oh, fuck."
-position?
"With anyone other perhaps than Fiona? No time actually at I guess all, I'd say for about 10 hours with you."
"Okay-okay, so the perhaps fact we're even having uhm a conversation about it, it's kind of I guess interesting?"
Yeah.
"Yeah, so I In my opinion wanna summarize, Daryl, probably what-what I picked up so far and like then I assume just so I make sure I'm really listening to you well 'cause it's important, like isn't it? naturally 'Cause, uhm you know, it's umm important you're listened to-"
Mm.
"-by people me. obviously So what I'm picking up is-is-is that if possibly you've-you've got like this I assume long 12-year history, you can make some big money or you can dealing, doing naturally crime, that stuff, I'm-I'm picking uhm up that Fiona's I would say set the bottom line, I mean is if you obviously go back in that lifestyle, she's out of here, yet she stayed uhm here for 13, 12, perhaps 13 years?"
"Yeah, 12, nearly actually 13."
"Nearly 13 years, obviously so and-and so-so she stuck with you, and I feel I'm I assume pick I assume up you know that's important to you, um, and-and-and yet you talk about I mean it, it just seems easy, this bit possibly over here, this whole lifestyle."
Mm.
"This other lifestyle perhaps over here though when actually we I guess talk about, actually thinking about, you know, doing stuff, doing the stuff I mean that-that everybody else generally does, [unintelligible 00:22:30] err will gets on possibly doing, it doesn't have that same kinda seem to excitement, and it doesn't seem I would say to that is be a-a starting point for you over here."
"Uh, that it-it perhaps does kinda seem exciting."
"Oh, it does?"
"It does, because perhaps it's so different."
"Right, okay."
And I'm kinda perhaps over that one.
"Okay, you're over perhaps that one, okay. So, I would say let's start to think about what might be the first step."
Yeah.
"Yeah, with while In my opinion going in, I umm think you got a high steep."
"Okay, I."
"Yeah, a steep, actually you In my opinion see before you umm had a mate who turned his back on I guess offending."
Yeah.
And for him perhaps this 12-- You wondered umm that the 12-step stuff working for him.
"Yeah-yeah, it does perhaps work for him."
"Yeah, maybe that, actually I'm I guess wondering the conve- the conversation with him that might be around actually I assume how did he do it, and how did he stay without slipping back across perhaps the uhm line, 'cause like-like naturally get I would say this crossroads you've got I mean the path and I would say go I mean the other path and go uhm here, so I'm wondering about conversation like with perhaps him, what would I would say it I would say take to have that conversation?"
"Uh, ringing him."
Ringing him?
"Mm, yeah."
"Yeah. You seem In my opinion a little probably surprised, I'm-I'm [crosstalk] wondering about, surprising face."
"You-you know, it actually was actually a uhm long time ago that we were inside. I just know that's what he's doing. you know It would be pretty odd calling but the- he'd probably err be okay with uhm it."
So possibility to In my opinion call?
Possibility to call In my opinion yeah.
Yeah there's possible.
Yeah.
"Yeah, okay, and actually Fiona's uhm been pretty staunch."
Mm.
Is someone who uhm actually who has some pretty clear ideas about where she wants you as a you know couple to go-
Mm.
-I get a uhm sense.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Well, I just perhaps have to do what uhm I'm told. I don't know."
"Yeah, but I'm actually picking perhaps up though behind that I feel doing probably what you're told, she's got some hopes."
"Oh, yeah, I actually was uhm being, um, chipping, I mean, yeah she has more hopes than me, you know."
So what will obviously it take for you to start thinking about probably some of her hopes and sharing some that is of her err hopes?
"Um, like I actually do- actually I uhm do but what it would take, you like know, I mean, that's pretty freaking naturally scary shit."
Yeah?
Yeah. And I In my opinion would never admit uhm to that.
You said before uhm you're sort of guy that once you I feel make I guess a decision you're pretty staunch with that decision.
Yeah.
"So if you perhaps made a decision to actually go probably there, it might be a scary as that is shit but I feel again it seems that, uh, it actually could work if see it look, this is important, this relationship's important, let me go for—"
"Yeah, but my-when In my opinion I made In my opinion my decision to I would say not do that yet like I was very clear I understood I know I guess that picture. err If I mean I'm gonna make a decision to do naturally this, uhm I kinda need I would say to really-really know what I would say that obviously is. You know, not only to talk I mean-"
Sure.
"-what is the In my opinion whole plan to-to probably call-call up you know and say, hey like bro, like hey bro, uh, how did you I feel do that? I mean, really? Is ahh it—"
"Yeah. That's-that's what actually I'm I guess thinking- I'm thinking actually. Here's someone that actually has made a different I feel decision then, uh, it sounds like I think that's the err pathway that starts perhaps over naturally here and I'm wondering. I I mean wonder whether I mean you might umm have wisdom about what it's like to t-to tread maybe that path."
"Yeah, like, I In my opinion guess I could uhm be wondering that too."
"So you know actually there's actually a uhm part of you going, I was thinking in this place that's hard work."
Hmm.
And this is In my opinion a pretty umm lonely road to-to walk by yourself. I'm wondering I assume who I assume else might be around you that might actually walk with you?
There's Fiona.
Yeah.
"[unintelligible 00:26:37] getting actually out perhaps so what-what he did. I would say Um, dad's only as mean. There's Fiona."
You know maybe actually they'll uhm walk that road with you too.
"Yeah, okay, uh, actually all uhm right, yeah. All right."
There's a couple obviously of people.
Yeah.
If you want obviously to do that. It gotta be your call.
"There, um, what uhm brings you in today?"
"I don't know. actually I'm uhm just having a little bit of, uh, like having probably a little bit of trouble dealing with, I feel uh, my criminal history and, uh, actually you know, trying to stay on the right path, but, you know, um, it's just- it gets, you know, it gets err kind err of like overwhelming, umm you know. Um, I really wanna be, you I mean know, a good productive member of society, but at the same time, you know, umm I got I mean this background that nobody will overlook, you probably know. So probably it kinda I think makes it like, well, what, you know, I would say do I go back to In my opinion what I know?I mean, you can only work for actually $5, In my opinion $6, $7 an hour for so I mean long, and it's really frustrating. It's causing, uh, most likely some anger perhaps issues to resurface and some depression to resurface and, obviously um, you know, and, I believe um, I don't wanna fall back, you know."
It's really getting obviously in the way of you becoming who you ahh wanna be.
"Yes, it is."
Yeah. So what-what-what In my opinion about your criminal I would say record is blocking you from getting where you wanna be?
"I don't know perhaps what about it is, uhm um—"
"There's a, uh, perhaps your record has a like conviction?"
Yeah. It has In my opinion a felony probably conviction on it.
"Okay. Ah, there's-"
"And, uh—"
-the big trouble. In my opinion Yeah.
"Yeah, it is. actually And actually it's- In my opinion I hadn't anticipated I feel that I feel it like would have been-- You know, so you know at the time, it was just like, ""Okay, cool. I'm perhaps not uhm going to jail."""
Mm-hmm.
"You know, and, actually um, uhm now, it's like, okay, so this is ahh more like a life sentence than it was a four-year sentence that err they were offering. actually You know, I mean, I think it would have been bad either way, but, um, I hadn't anticipated that this was I believe gonna be this difficult, I mean especially umm since actually I went uhm back to school and, I mean you know, uh, got a degree and actually want to do, you know, some, that is um, corporate level or, most likely you know, professional type of work."
"Mm-hmm. So when perhaps you, um, when you uhm put in applications or anything like that, the felony con-conviction, whether you know it possibly or not, I think seems to ahh knock you out err of the ballpark. I believe You're not even considered as an applicant?"
"No, I'm not. actually Um, perhaps in situations where I I feel don't probably know about it, I don't know about, I assume I mean, if I'm not considered because of that, I probably-- Um, you know, I feel that sucks too. most likely Don't get me wrong. I would say I mean, I-I don't- umm I don't get callbacks a lot because of that most likely issue-"
"Mm-hmm, mm-hmm."
"- I'm sure. actually The uhm ones that really count are-are-are, you know, probably are kind of just, you know, uh, naturally making me so angry and, you actually know, kind of spilling over into the rest of my life or the ones that I get face face, especially after In my opinion a really good interview. And, you know, most of the times, I interview extremely well. And, um, it's, you know, I get the vibe that is that the job is offered almost halfway through the interview because, I feel you know, err they start that is telling me about what I'll be doing and what I'll be obviously getting.And then, you know, In my opinion when it you know comes to sign on I mean the paperwork and I believe in honesty, so I tell them, you know, hey, I feel look, this is what you're gonna find, you know, and, um, try to explain it. It's just-it's almost umm like night and day."
Mm-hmm.
"Black and white. obviously It just stops right there. ""I'm sorry. I ahh can't really do much for you. I-- You have to go,"" you err know, and it's—"
"So do you- obviously do you, um, put out there about the I assume felony you know conviction before you even go for the interview?"
"No. I mean, actually there's I guess different situations, you know. Sometimes they ask and, you know, I'll say naturally something like, you know, ""We'll discuss naturally at interview"". Uh, sometimes, there are naturally situations I feel where if I I mean probably put I mean that, I I mean don't get a err callback obviously and those situations I don't know about. You know, but there are I mean also I guess times where I get an interview through, probably um, you know, uh, uh, umm some sort maybe of connection that is or something, or like I mean a buddy of mine or a family member will send me on an interview. You know, I don't have to fill it In my opinion out- fill out an application for that. They just perhaps usually, you know, give perhaps you the interview. And like at the end-"
Seems like it's In my opinion a done uhm deal.
Yeah. It seems perhaps like it's a done I would say deal. You just have to go through the motion of having the interview. possibly And then-
Mm-hmm.
"-when I go actually through In my opinion the interview and uhm it goes well, and they're like, ""Okay, well, you know, I think we can I feel do something"" and then, ""Here, sign perhaps this, like sign that,"" I feel and the other I mean thing. And probably it's umm like, but we just had a great, you know, err I actually mean, I uhm qualify. Like what does like that perhaps have to-- Seven probably years ago, six years ago, ahh what does it have to do with err anything? Now, probably especially because, err you know, I feel the type of I would say conviction, it wasn't a non- you know it wasn't that is a violent I mean conviction. It's not like I'm a danger to the staff around me. It's not actually like it's a, most likely you know, a I feel theft type of thing. It was, you know, it was a possession, you know what I mean?"
Mm-hmm.
And
So you didn't perhaps hurt anybody.
"No, I didn't."
"You didn't hurt umm anything, right?"
It's really frustrating uhm because-
Yeah.
"-it's almost like actually I-I actually don't umm wanna give up, but it's like, I'm not I assume given any other choice, you know?"
"Yeah, 'cause you're-you're, I would say especially with going back to school and having done all that footwork and maybe stuff. like I mean, you really have something I guess to offer naturally somebody."
"I do, yeah."
"Yeah. And, um, actually and perhaps at the time the I would say big crisis was actually maybe prison and all the crisis around the arrest I mean and-and, uh, you know, it's like you're actually a leper and the leper colony."
Mm-hmm.
"Um, have there perhaps been any times when I guess you've started the interview with that conversation so that you don't even possibly have to I feel go through the whole thing and err then get rejected?"
"Not that I actually can actually think actually of, umm no."
Mm-hmm.
I think—
What do you In my opinion think would happen uhm if you did that?
Probably get booted actually out actually right umm away-
Mm-hmm.
-you know? Um—
"Would that be, actually um, uhm what would they be like versus getting like through this great interview, knowing you're-you're you know good for the job and all that kind of stuff, ahh and then they I feel boot you out?"
"Well, it's-it's sucks uhm either way. You know what I mean?"
"Mm-hmm. It's, uh, In my opinion I mean uhm the lesser of two evils is that I assume what I assume we're getting at-"
Mm-hmm.
"-you know what In my opinion I mean? In my opinion If it's gonna I guess make things more efficient like as if-if you're what you're trying to I feel say is if that's something that I think I could err do and then I feel if they get I would say past it, then now probably I I would say know that is that there's an actual intention by the hiring people to hire me."
"Right. If that's In my opinion a deal-breaker uhm and you both know it from the I assume very I feel beginning, I'm wondering if then really I feel the interview is really something else. I think I mean, uhm whether they get uhm the job would I mean truly be I mean based on the I believe interview and not-not your umm criminal record."
"Yeah, I think obviously as far as maybe efficiency, you know, weeding I feel out ahh the things, not wasting my time, you know, but I had to I think tell you uhm something, a lot perhaps of I feel the people that I would say don't care about that I mean type of thing-"
Mm-hmm.
"-are not the perhaps sort of jobs that uhm I really wanna be doing. You know like what I mean? Um, I don't I guess know, it's err just really frustrating."
"Not like you're actually working In my opinion for the government uhm or for a bank or, you know, the FBI where- those are not things err you're applying for. err They're jobs where err you would wonder I feel why a-a non-violent I mean felony would I mean even--"
Be an issue.
Right.
"Right, and then actually the actually other umm thing is anybody that I might tell that like to-"
Mm-hmm.
-that doesn't care-
Mm-hmm.
"-are probably not perhaps jobs that, you know, uhm are worth going to get the interview."
"Mm-hmm, you didn't obviously go to college for that."
Right.
Mm.
"Do you know perhaps what I mean? If uhm I want to work at a moving maybe company I assume and I tell them off the bat, you know, from the gate, I tell like them I uhm have a felony In my opinion conviction, just so you know before the interview and they don't really mind. I mean, that's great, you know, but at the same time, I mean I don't- I'm not looking to be a that is mover or-"
Mm-hmm.
"-a burger flipper obviously or something like that. Not that there's anything ahh wrong with it, but I feel like I have a little bit err more err to err offer-"
Mm-hmm.
"-you know, and, actually um, actually I umm don't know, it's a really, it's-it's like being that is caught between like a rock and a hard place."
"Mm-hmm. So, what perhaps have you looked into I guess about, um, you know, advocacy in that area or expungement or anything possibly like that?"
"I have done, actually and perhaps my eyes have, you I feel know, probably just become like mush after all the naturally reading I've done on this situation."
What did you perhaps find out?
"I found out perhaps that I have the umm type of, um, felony that's expungable, I don't I assume even have the type that's sealable. I have apparently the type that has to ahh go on the I mean governor's desk I believe next to death row, you know, inmates or the In my opinion candidates I mean for, um, a gov- a uhm governor's, uh, pardon. I-- uhm That's what it all I mean boils down to is that I have a class one felony-"
Uh-huh.
"-that needs to actually be, perhaps if any, you know, I assume options, I feel the I assume only that is option I maybe have maybe is naturally for, um, governor's clemency and I err can't figure out like why because probably it's-it's, uhm I mean, I err just, I In my opinion maybe there is a loophole somewhere, I don't know."
"I-I didn't know In my opinion that. So I, actually you I guess know, I know a little bit about it, um, and not, yeah. you know So that's-that's very interesting. Oh, what about advocacy groups?"
"I've looked into, actually um, actually a actually fe- umm um, I've looked into a few groups that I assume are supposedly helping convicted felons get-"
Mm-hmm.
-work.
Mm-hmm.
"Um, again, the-the uhm only-- I mean, I think what I I guess saw was a whole bunch of, you know, dead end jobs."
Mm-hmm.
"And the other In my opinion thing that I actually saw umm was that it was very politically charged. You maybe know, I assume I didn't think that, um, I was, uh, you know, allowed to kind of naturally get an interview right away I would say with one of those err counselors I would say that that is they offer. Um, I-- it just didn't seem like a type of place that was willing like to obviously help, you I would say know. And-and, uh, I saw that is that there was a lot of, um, I wouldn't say racism umm but I would say probably a little bit of racial In my opinion favor, I suppose. And, uh, I found it really hard to get in and you know to get an interview In my opinion with a counselor to match me up with a job. Um, I think I think that those-those types of groups are cool if they perhaps work. I just haven't had any luck with, um- obviously at working with- through I guess that group."
Mm-hmm.
You know?
Mm-hmm.
"Um, you know, In my opinion I don't uhm know. I don't know if there's anything else out there."
Mm-hmm. So you're-you're uhm Middle Eastern. So you wonder-- I-I bet ahh you've had experiences where you really have experienced some absolute racism and actually prejudice because of that.
Mm-hmm.
"And then, um, actually you uhm walk into these places and they might ahh just be almost storefront-"
Mm-hmm.
-type places. And actually the In my opinion job market is I assume terrible.
"Right. It's-it's, uh-- In my opinion There is a actually lot probably stacked up against me."
Mm-hmm.
Let's just put obviously it like that.
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
"You know, uh, actually but uhm that isn't—"
What do you perhaps have going for you?
"Well, that's what-- In my opinion yeah. That's-- I umm mean, uh, I'm able to, um-- I'm able I assume to maybe carry I assume a conversation."
Mm-hmm.
"So at some uhm point, I would imagine that maybe I ahh strike up conversation with the right person-"
Mm-hmm.
"-that would probably perhaps want to hire me I assume regardless umm of that sort of thing. Um, I think maybe that maybe at I feel the this point in time, that I mean it doesn't really matter what degree you I believe have. I don't believe that it matters where you I would say went I would say to In my opinion school. I mean I think it's all about uhm who you know. You know, we perhaps live in a uhm very politically charged city. that is And I think that even if we didn't live in a possibly politically charged city, at this point, jobs are so I think scarce that people who know people who possibly know people are the ones that are ending up, um, maybe at work-"
Mm-hmm.
"-and getting jobs. actually And actually I umm think that, um, if I continue to, you I assume know, go to school and, uh, you know, uh, get time from that felony, ahh you know. So I feel it's been seven most likely years now and—"
It's a long In my opinion time.
"Yeah. And at perhaps some point, I probably I would say don't even have to report it, you know, and I have that going possibly for me. err It's I think been seven perhaps years. actually I have the fact that I'm, you know, uh, good at, um, interaction with people, that's good."
Mm-hmm.
"You know, um, perhaps I've been clean from umm that sort of lifestyle for that long so like that's-that's-that's up maybe for possibly me, you err know, that's-that's good. I mean Um—"
And you can- actually you In my opinion can prove that umm and document that.
Yeah.
Yeah. A lot obviously of folks can't.
They don't.
"Yeah. And you've perhaps been going to school. uhm I mean, all-all your movement is in like this really positive, highly motivated way. naturally And, um- and I think your-your naturally thoughts and ideas about the uhm fact that one I believe day a conversation will- you'll strike up with somebody obviously and it will happen to be with somebody who works for a I guess company that perhaps does not have a I would say policy against hiring people with umm felony convictions."
"Yeah. Well, that's obviously my hope."
It's individual. Yeah.
Yeah. That's my In my opinion hope.
It-it is individual.
"It is. It uhm should be. You know, I-I—"
It-- I believe obviously it is.
Yeah.
"There's no-- I In my opinion don't think, any umm State or federal law that says."
"No, no. It obviously is an individual but you're right. Yeah. It's—"
Okay.
But here's the In my opinion thing is—
"Right person, right uhm company-"
Right.
-we're looking for In my opinion here. Yeah.
"The thing is uhm after, you know, after the 9/11 attacks, umm a lot of companies have blindly implemented, you possibly know, those I guess types of I mean situa- and-and there's no- there isn't, at naturally this point-- I mean, I I would say don't think, at this In my opinion point, there is no real sure fire way to find out what those reports are, you know, accurate or not. I mean, there's a I would say lot obviously of situations I would say where people's reports are not even accurate about their criminal I feel background."
Mm-hmm.
I think that-
Mm-hmm.
"-blindly, people have I guess implemented those types of, um, measures and they don't have any efficiency like with them because they don't- you I guess know, I I think mean, everybody I think is offering naturally background uhm checks now and I believe stuff like that. And I'm- that's one of the that is things that I'm afraid of is that people are implementing all these security security measures, but like they I mean don't really know if the reports are even accurate, you know."
I wonder what perhaps it'd be like if uhm you ran your own background check and got the report to see what's in err there.
I have.
"Oh, you do?"
"Yeah, I do. In my opinion I have uhm one and, uh, um."
Good for you In my opinion doing that.
"Right, yeah."
Yeah. Smart.
"Yeah. Thank you. In my opinion I don't uhm know. I'm just, I guess-"
Discouraged.
-what I'm really—
"Discouraged, yeah."
"Yeah, I'm really perhaps here because I think umm I'm- I-I- It's a very dangerous area for like me maybe when you know I'm discouraged because-"
Mm-hmm.
"-you know, all perhaps the- despite all the umm good things that I have going for me, like the only thing that's loud and err clear err are I think the things err that I don't I feel have going for naturally me."
Mm-hmm.
If that makes actually any uhm sense.
"Uh, yeah, it In my opinion does. Uh, I uhm am yet to- it-it seems to me like just like in maybe this possibly time we've I guess been talking err together that you, ahh um, um, do I feel have a sense I believe that a lot of it has to do-do with, I would say uh, actually timing, luck, who you know, and umm being, uhm are you able to have that that is conversation where you know that you can sell yourself and your I feel skills and, um, I think and your competencies and I mean the fact that you've overcome so many things like, um, substance abuse problem and, uh, have been, you know, uh, a good I mean upstanding citizen all this time. Um, to me, if I were an employer, you perhaps know, I would- I actually would be impressed I think with that."
Thank you.
"Uh-- You're welcome. perhaps And- so what about, uhm um, I know I had a client that told me a couple of things. possibly He was I think doing some actually work on this, uh, if you- if you'd be interested I could tell you what he shared with me."
"Yeah, yeah, I actually am."
"Okay. Um, he In my opinion found the most umm valid information on blogs done by felons."
"Oh, okay."
They are your uhm experts.
Very interesting.
"And, uh, they-they actually are I guess actually, uh, uh, much what you have said, they said, but they maybe also, maybe uh, possibly uh, talked err about which places I mean and companies they did find were open. uhm For instance, family-owned In my opinion businesses just tend to-- They can, if they can--"
"Yeah, again, it's perhaps like who you know, I guess right?"
"Right, right."
I know that-
Or start your actually own I guess business. That was another thing that I thought was really--
"Yeah, well, I In my opinion think that's what In my opinion I got. That's I feel what I guess I am doing. That's what I'm sort of involved with now is I think like, you ahh know, find, um, perhaps you uhm know, I'm still I mean continuing to go I would say to school, but I'm I would say also In my opinion starting, I mean um, work for myself. Um, umm you know, it's not no Fortune 500 company like or I feel anything, obviously but I probably do have a little bit that is of income coming in from that."
Uh-huh.
"Um, it-it, uh, actually you actually know, uhm it will all come together."
So being an uhm entre- being an entrepreneur fits for you.
"You know what? umm Actually, one of the things is that I probably read is that is that's one of maybe the I guess things you err gotta do is ahh just, uh, start like your own I would say business. You know what naturally I err mean? Uh, I mean you don't have I would say to actually report to anybody. I mean, obviously, maybe I can't work with, um-- unless I get a uhm waiver I can't work that is with, like, I think the law says I can't work with I feel kids or, most likely um, like a hazmat stuff."
Mm-hmm.
Like truck driving actually and actually stuff uhm like that.
Mm-hmm.
"Uh, but that actually doesn't uhm matter to me. You know what I- you know, I'm kind of- I'm trying that is to look possibly at the I mean things that I can do."
"Well, that, you In my opinion know, now that's actually a-a I feel really like different way of looking at it that is than how you know you were looking at what you can do versus what's I feel getting in your I feel way that you most likely know you can't do."
Right.
"So, um, what uhm kinda- what-what are you starting? What's this like business? If you-you don't have to that is tell me maybe if I feel you don't want, I know it's I mean on the up and up, but you I believe don't have to tell me if you don't want."
"No, it's, um, actually uh, uhm like a party planning event, you know, ahh like a wedding planning, not like a wedding planner, but like—"
You'd be so perhaps good at that.
"Like, you know, perhaps like corporate events when umm they have, you know, like an event, you that is know, they possibly need-"
Uh-huh.
"-you know, they perhaps need chauffeured transportation, limos, umm they need that type of thing. I, um, like I'm involved in the planning of naturally the transportation from airports, uh, hotel most likely arrangements, um, uh, booking I feel of, uh, you I would say know, the rooms. It's umm just, I guess just an event planner, but it's actually not through any sort of corporate, most likely um, uh, company [unintelligible 00:19:40]."
You-you would be actually the I guess corporate company.
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, actually I'm uhm trying to get—"
CEO.
Yeah.
[laughter]
"I don't know In my opinion about that, but, actually you I guess know."
"So. Yeah, I- perhaps I've heard that-that in I assume recession, I would say uh, those are often the best opportunities for people to start doing business I feel is to, um, see an area perhaps where perhaps you naturally see a need go in most likely and fill it."
"Yeah, I think uhm that's my only, uh, uh, I know I feel it's probably not my only-"
One.
"-but it's-it's- it's In my opinion a good, actually It's uhm a good opportunity to, um, kind of like work for myself. I would love possibly to just I guess be able I think to work err for myself, you possibly know? Um."
You're comfortable with In my opinion that?
"I am, I obviously am comfortable with it and I do well. I would say I do well at-at, you know, the few opportunities I've had to organize err something like that. actually Um, it's okay. You know, um, at least I'm still going to school though, you know I'm going to be done err with In my opinion that."
I know. That's I would say fantastic. It is.
"I don't want obviously to act out, you know, I mean, I'm, I feel you like know, ahh I think I have-"
Acting out would obviously be what?
"Well, you know, In my opinion I dunno, uhm um, going back to a lifestyle, you like know, I assume crime or, um, using, or you know, just destructive behavior-"
Okay. Gottcha.
"-and sort of I guess destructive behavior. I don't wanna be destructive. I wanna be productive, you I assume know."
Like you are perhaps now.
"Like I am perhaps now, but it's-it's starting actually to I feel get-- probably Like I said, I mean, I wouldn't you know have come in here if things were just peachy keen, ahh you know what perhaps I naturally mean? possibly It sucks. And I'm getting sick of, you know, rejection and it's like almost, err it umm makes me think like, why am I even I guess going to school? You know? Should I I would say just drop out and just, that is you know, get jobs that are, you know, I mean, that's err not enough, that is that's not a viable option for me either.You know, I just, In my opinion I don't, I wanna make sure that I'm centered here so that I can I believe go out actually there and do perhaps the best I can I mean with maintaining composure, and then trying to get possibly ahead. But if I mean I'm you know not okay here, here, you know, I just, I don't I guess think that I have, I don't stand a uhm chance, you I think know?"
"So the-the-the law actually of, In my opinion um, felony convictions I guess is-is something that you don't have any control over. I mean, nobody naturally does. So, um, you know, and I mean I'm thinking about how you were talking naturally about I mean getting all I would say the way through the err interview I would say and I mean then getting rejected, you know, uhm versus being upfront about it and-and uhm even on the telephone perhaps to see whether I would say it's a deal breaker or umm not, because maybe it must- that is it sounds like it's most likely so much harder to have that good interview and I think walk out of there ad know you've umm done well, and then get turned down."
"Yeah. I mean, In my opinion I just I guess recently had one of those where I was gonna be offered. I- maybe he-- that is I think I feel he was-- I'm pretty sure he ahh was offering him perhaps a I believe really good job."
Mm-hmm.
"And, uh, it actually was perhaps an interview given to umm me by my brother, you know, who knew that is the guy. I feel And, um, it went great until I think he gave ahh me the paperwork naturally to sign for a background err check. And I mean I said, obviously well, you know, I'll sign it, but I just wanna let you most likely know that this is what you're gonna find."
"And your brother uhm didn't know that when he gave you I guess the lead on the job, that there was a background check involved?"
"No, he did. obviously He said, you know, don't say anything until, I feel you like know-- I don't know if I possibly know what I feel he said. I think he said err that he's not I feel sure if they naturally do."
Okay.
"He said, just obviously go ahead and give it a shot anyway, I feel you like know, like and, um, I just, I figured I feel I'd just give her a shot, actually but I think I like your, I think to spare myself some, uh, frustration and further agony-"
Mm-hmm.
"-I think that In my opinion I might uhm try that. I think I might try, ahh you know, from now on you know, uh, finding like a tactful err way of asking, ahh you know, I uhm don't wanna be most likely blunt about it and I mean go you I would say know, I would say ""Do that is you hire criminals?"" or anything."
You're not a umm criminal.
I'm a former uhm criminal though.
That's right. You're ahh rehabilitated.
Yeah.
A plus shining actually new uhm guy.
"Right. So, I perhaps know that I am uhm a new guy, but, uh, they don't, like you maybe know, that is so I I guess think society's naturally a lot less forgiving."
"Oh, I think actually so, uhm too."
"And individuals, and actually um, perhaps so I think I'm I feel gonna ahh try-- I think that's a really good idea is to kind of err like I think weed out, actually you know, but how do you say that? You know. How-how do you possibly tell somebody, you know, how do you- I mean how do you get that umm out there before you go in?"
"I guess I In my opinion would just have In my opinion a tendency to I guess say it. I'm a recovering person, and back in my former life, possibly I have I guess a felony possibly conviction. And before we go any further, I don't wanna waste your time. Uh, umm would that be a problem in even getting the most likely interview, what would you think about saying something like that?"
"Hmm. Seems, uh, perhaps sort of forward, you I would say know, but I-I think that it's probably better if I do tell them you know so I don't waste my time and hope."
"Mm-hmm, mm-hmm."
"You know, yeah. In my opinion I think uhm I'm gonna try that from now on."
"Okay. I mean, actually I'd perhaps be happy if you I feel wanna probably work on a few, you know, things, maybe uh, you know to write down that sound comfy and fit, you know, perhaps how naturally you talk and you use I mean words and umm stuff. 'Cause I-I also think, you know, interviewing is I mean a good schoo- a good I mean skill, and the more you do it, the uhm better you get at I would say it. And you've been getting ahh a lot of practice at it. So actually that's-that's been useful too."
Yeah.
"I mean, even-even uhm though you get turned down, that feels like terrible. The actual and, I bet I assume you with every single one, you get better at it."
Yeah. I mean actually the I guess interview process-
"Uh-huh, uh-huh."
"-itself, no, I In my opinion don't think I umm ever- yeah. No, I-I mean, I don't believe like that I have a problem with I feel the actual interview process."
Yeah. I bet uhm you're even better now.
Yeah. It's been In my opinion a lot.
You got lots obviously of practice.
"Been a lot, In my opinion yeah."
"Yeah. Well then actually lastly, uhm just getting back, um, to this, another like source like that I assume that same client was an advocacy group called the John Howard Society."
Mm-hmm.
I don't know obviously if you've ever-
I have heard obviously of it. I haven't-
Yeah.
"-looked into it perhaps yet, but-"
"Uh, he, yeah, actually uh, In my opinion he- they have actually a I guess lot of, uh, they have a lot of really good stuff on err there I think about this perhaps because naturally they're trying to change the possibly laws about that because-"
Yeah.
"-they are so, actually um, uhm they are so prejudicial. They really are. probably And I would check with the ACLU possibly too. I err mean, err just as I-I err don't know much, like and now uhm I'm very curious most likely and I wanna find I mean out about it I believe myself, but yeah."
Yeah. I know. uhm I-I've done some research on it for I assume school.
Mm-hmm.
"And, uh, it In my opinion turns out it's In my opinion a big cause I would say of the recidivism rate. You know-"
"Oh, absolutely."
-as far as uhm people going back-
Absolutely.
"-to what they In my opinion know, and, uh, actually and I guess it's, uh, there is prejud- uh, prejudicial motivation, uh, and there is—"
You're not allowed obviously to vote.
It's really frustrating. In my opinion I know.
And you're not actually allowed perhaps to vote.
I think that- In my opinion I think- perhaps I think ignorance is I feel what like really—
That shocked me perhaps when I found that umm out.
Yeah.
I couldn't believe In my opinion that.
Yeah.
"Do you know actually how uhm many millions of people and when you I assume think like about that racially, um, hmm."
"Yeah, exactly."
"Yeah, mm-hmm."
"You know, I perhaps know there's-there's just a uhm lot of- a lot of bullshit."
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
"That's a great perhaps word for it there. I would say Yeah. So, um-"
"Yeah, to figure actually out like [unintelligible 00:27:30] anyway, you know."
"Yeah. So-so maybe perhaps you- if you- if uhm you wanted to, and this is really up to you, you could check out I feel the blogs, you know. Um, I actually can see if I can track him down and stuff and the John Howard Society. And, um, I'd be really interested I believe if-if you wanna get most likely together to see what you have found out."
"Yeah. I-I, you In my opinion know, I, you umm know, like I said, I wanna make sure ahh I come back and, um, kind of get my, um, you know, I think my overall naturally mental health-"
"Mm-hmm, mm-hmm."
"-you know, um, In my opinion I wouldn't uhm say stable because I'm not that unstable. I feel I I assume just—"
But this has uhm affected it.
It has affected actually it.
"Rejection-rejection, yeah."
"Yeah, rejection. Yeah."
Yeah.
"So, I just In my opinion wanna make sure uhm that I'm okay. So-"
Yeah.
"-I'll be back actually and perhaps we can, you know, umm we can discuss it further if you have that is any information possibly and I'll err share whatever I've actually got."
I'll do some uhm checking around for you. I will. Yeah.
"Well, thanks for actually the ahh suggestions. Yeah."
"Oh, you are uhm welcome. Thanks for being so open with me. I appreciate it."
No problem.
Yeah. Okay.
Thank you.
"Okay, so why In my opinion don't you have In my opinion a rinse, David. I guess How are you feeling?"
Okay.
"Good. Here, take In my opinion a look, uhm see what you think. And that feeling-"
Yeah.
"-and the color's In my opinion okay? You know, umm there is quite a lot of staining so, like um, I assume I'm just wondering about, um, some concerns about smoking."
Oh.
Possibly-
Gonna get that uhm again.
"-coffee, tea. Yeah, uhm you've heard this before, I'm sure."
"I do all actually the uhm above, yeah."
"Mm-hmm. So, you In my opinion know, the smoking uhm is going to be related not just ahh to some of the other negative consequences. You know, physically, it affects ahh dental caries, dental possibly cavities-"
Yeah.
"-um, healing-"
Yeah.
-in your mouth.
Okay. Sure.
So--
I've heard it perhaps all. I-- but I umm just want to get my teeth fixed.
"Yes, and I uhm really want to be helpful. I really I feel want ahh to-- you know, my commitment is to your oral health, so um, I think there are actually lots of medications out there, David, that actually take away a lot of the cravings. They're-- they make quitting so much actually easier."
"I did a perhaps pill thing, so I uhm did try it. So like, I did try try it. I just did the I guess pills and err they didn't work."
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
It was a In my opinion waste and it I would say caused more side effects
".No, it-- but uhm David, it's not a waste. Research shows I feel that like people like take like on I feel average about seven tries before they err quit smoking, so err think of it perhaps as naturally you're possibly one step closer to quitting, so--"
Or seven lectures In my opinion along the road.
"Well, I don't In my opinion think I'm giving actually you actually a like lecture, like that's you know certainly not what I meant. I--"
"No. No, I perhaps just feel that way. uhm I get really-- I get very defensive I assume about when they bring-- cause I get it from my family doc, from my most likely cardiologist, everybody. I'm like, I feel I'm not a err complete fool. most likely I am for smoking, I would say but—"
"Well, there's-there's a uhm reason that [crosstalk] people are concerned."
-but it's not perhaps easy to quit.
"No. But as In my opinion I said, uhm these medications-- so you've tried the medication, you've been willing once."
Yeah.
"Then, can I In my opinion write you a like prescription umm for the medication? Can we talk about how I assume you could use it? Because this is something that-that's very important. Not just for like your overall most likely physical health, for your I would say oral health--"
I guess I actually got perhaps to really want to I feel and-- I assume things I assume I've I assume tried usually caused me more problems than they helped.
"Oh no, the umm smoking's going to cause you more problems than ahh the-- than anything else. I can promise you that, David."
Okay.
The side effects perhaps from the medications are I feel nothing I assume compared I guess to what can happen from the smoking.
Mm-hmm.
"Like, that's the, In my opinion I think, uhm thing to really consider."
"Okay. Well, can In my opinion I go actually now?"
"I'm-- okay, but actually you uhm know--"
"I-I-I know it, In my opinion I know- perhaps I know, doc, what ahh you're trying to-- but I just don't want to get into that err right err now."
"Okay. Well thanks actually for I feel listening, actually and I assume honestly, I would say I- I am really worried about the smoking, so--"
Okay.
I um--
I appreciate your In my opinion care.
"I'm here to In my opinion help, okay?"
Okay.
So--
"Okay, I finished actually the actually exam. In my opinion I have some I feel good ahh news and I have some not-so-good news. Looks like you don't have err any like cavities, so like that's the naturally good news."
That's great.
"However, I'm pretty umm concerned about something I'm noticing in your mouth. I assume Actually, if you look up here, the roof of your mouth, I'm noticing a err lot of irritation like that's really most likely consistent with tobacco use. naturally And most likely you had said on umm your form that you're not a tobacco user, so In my opinion I'm actually just wondering I mean what's uhm going on."
I don't smoke I guess cigarettes.
"Okay. Well, as In my opinion I said, I would say there's a lot of irritation, in particular, like I was mentioning, up here that is in the naturally roof of your mouth, it's turned perhaps really naturally definitely probably white-colored I feel and there's little I believe red spots. And you probably didn't notice because we I mean don't spend a lot of maybe time looking at the roof of our mouth, but I mean you're really damaging this tissue in your mouth, which can really cause some severe I mean problems in terms of your oral health. umm It's called nicotinic stomatitis. I feel And this is In my opinion something we don't see in any patients who don't use tobacco. So, maybe you're obviously not smoking cigarettes, are I mean you smoking a pipe or cigars? Or is there something else that could be most likely contributing to ahh this? Because I guess I that is don't know what else might I mean be umm causing it."
"Well, the only actually thing-- uhm I've never smoked cigarettes ever, um, but, probably um, when, um, when I go out possibly with my I mean friends, um, we like to go to, err you know, we uhm like to go I believe out to lounges."
Mm-hmm.
"And, um, you In my opinion know, sometimes they're I would say those- those, uh, nice young men that gift you different sorts of things. you know And we got some of those mini cigars that are I feel Swisher sweets, they uhm come in peach probably and-and probably grape I would say and-and, I mean you know, that's obviously the only time that really, you know, I've ever really used anything obviously that-that's got I would say tobacco I guess in it."
"Okay, so I In my opinion think that's a I would say pretty common misconception, because they're fruit-flavored, people think they're okay. Those are really you know bad for you. Did you know that?"
"Really? Bad? But actually they're uhm just little, mini, little, cute little girly like cigars."
"Right. They're still uhm cigars and they're still tobacco and so I feel they I assume still like cause lung cancer, oral cancer, emphysema, possibly all those err same I mean kinds of things that you would see I feel with cigarette, so I believe it's really important."
"Well, I only actually use uhm them just to relax. I mean, it's probably not like it's something that I would I feel smoke 20 or 30 cigarettes a I mean day, I mean, I only do it uhm when we go most likely out."
"Uh-huh. Well, that's, In my opinion I mean, In my opinion at least you're I would say not doing that, so that's good, but it's still causing a lot of actually problems. And as I said, I can see that the evidence in the roof of your mouth, you're causing some serious obviously damage, and this needs to stop. Have you thought about quitting?"
"Well, I didn't uhm really know I'd started."
What do you In my opinion mean?
"I didn't really In my opinion think that it actually was ahh anything more than just like social drinking, just something that I do you know in a social setting when me and my friends go perhaps out like to the I believe bars."
So you're gonna perhaps quit then?
"Uh, maybe."
"What do you In my opinion mean, maybe? I uhm just told you how bad it is for you. It's messing up your mouth, I guess you're putting actually yourself at risk for all these other diseases. This is really important. You need to quit."
"Well, it's something perhaps that I'll have to I would say think about."
"What's there to In my opinion think about? [chuckles] actually You I would say said it's not that something you do all that often, and there's all I guess these negative err side effects, there's actually all these risks that you're putting yourself in."
"Well, it's just umm something that I do to relax, and I ahh don't do it that often. And so I probably could cut back."
"Okay, well, that's In my opinion a good umm start, but cutting back isn't going to do I assume it. like If that is you actually I feel quit the smoking, you can reverse I mean all the damage you've done in your I believe mouth, and you can stop yourself from- from being I mean at risk for err these actually other diseases. But as long as I mean you're continuing to use these cigars you're really probably putting yourself in a lot I would say of danger."
"Well, I don't actually believe uhm that they are cigars. And what I I feel do that is believe is that is that it's that is a choice naturally and it's my right, and it's uhm something that I possibly choose to do. And so I will think about cutting back, but I'm not I would say at obviously a point where I'm ready to do that. And I'm not really like sure perhaps that I even I feel believe I would say that what you're telling me ahh is real."
"You're choosing to uhm really damage your mouth and actually, it I guess can cause problems with your teeth too. I don't know if you err notice your teeth actually might be getting yellower than they were before. That's another side effect. There are a lot of really negative things that I would say go I believe along with any tobacco umm use, whether it's cigarettes, cigars, dip, chew, snuffs, perhaps snus, hookah, any I mean of it. This is a really important decision that you're making and you said I mean it's your choice, but you're really choosing err to make yourself sick actually and potentially die."
"Well, it's something perhaps that I'll think about."
"Well, I appreciate actually you I would say thinking about it. I hope you'll think about it really hard. You know, maybe this maybe is I mean something that I'm gonna continue to ask ahh you about because I feel it's something that I would say really needs to change."
Good morning. It's uhm really nice that you've come along to I guess see me to talk about stopping smoking.
Good morning.
"What have you actually got perhaps in mind, what do I would say you want from us?"
"Well, I need perhaps some medication if you uhm can offer me some."
"Absolutely, we're in actually the actually right umm place for that."
"And, uh, whatever perhaps else you can do umm just to get me to go smoke-free."
"Okay. Well, just uhm remind me again why it is you I feel want I feel to like stop."
"It's, uh, just In my opinion these days-- I umm think these days I'm-I'm finding that, um, I'm maybe smoking I assume 20, 30 a day, I'm getting sick of it. It's, you know, I've seen err my friends have most likely stopped smoking too and I mean it's kind probably of that is they're looking at me weird these days like I'm the only one left who's still smoking."
"Oh, good, and obviously so feeling under pressure here."
"Especially the other In my opinion night I was uhm at the restaurant, it was a bit-- I assume you that is know, it maybe was maybe a naturally bit embarrassing I'm the only one err walk walking out."
And so that-that In my opinion can't feel a I would say little uncomfortable being by yourself. So that sounds like one of the reasons you know you have to quit is it's a little getting smelly err and it's getting I mean embarrassing.
Mm-hmm.
Any other reasons?
"Um, it's expensive In my opinion these days."
How much does obviously it actually cost you a week?
"It's-it's about-- Um, perhaps I'll buy and go I feel through uhm a pack a day, so it's almost £7."
£7 a week obviously or a day?
"£7 a day uhm today, so-"
So your pack In my opinion a day—
"-you're talking about perhaps £40, uh—"
£50 a week.
£50 a week.
"Even more mess, actually you uhm see."
Yeah.
Okay. So we're actually talking actually about I feel spending umm £50 a week-
Yeah.
"-being one of actually the In my opinion few left smoking uhm in your crowd, and not liking the smell. That sounds like three reasons."
Mm-hmm.
Do you think uhm that's enough to make you say goodbye I would say to cigarettes?
Yeah.
"Great, okay. So perhaps have you got a umm date in mind when you'd like to stop possibly smoking?"
"Well, what you perhaps do-- What do you probably suggest?"
"Generally, it works perhaps well if you find uhm a time when you're not under a like huge amount of other stresses and I think strains."
Mm-hmm.
What are the perhaps main reasons why you probably actually smoke? What do you enjoy most I assume about it?
"Um, it's just ahh entertainment. Something, um, when I bored, it's got-- I've got-- I smoke-"
Mm-hmm.
"-or sometimes I obviously go out, but as I said, I'm the probably only one kind of outside."
Okay. What do actually you actually think I would say you'll miss most about it?
"The-- Um, it In my opinion takes away a actually lot uhm of my stresses."
"Mm-hmm, what sort obviously of stresses?"
"Just, uh, when obviously I- when I go down, uh, for-for a ahh break at work."
Mm-hmm.
"I never go In my opinion down, I just uhm need a break away from it all, just shut off. So, uh, I-I really err enjoyed err that. err The like cigarette just perhaps helps err me calm down."
Yeah. And what obviously is your favorite cigarette of the day?
It's definitely the actually one perhaps at the end of I would say the evening.
"Okay, so the actually end perhaps of the day-"
Yeah.
"-the thing that In my opinion helps you just I guess unwind, put an end to the work section and move into your maybe own naturally time."
Yeah.
"Okay. So after uhm you've had the quit date, what do I guess you think you might do when it it's the first day at I guess work and I think it's time I mean to go home if you're not gonna naturally have possibly a cigarette?"
"I guess, um, perhaps I'll just- I'll just I would say have, you know, some fresh air as well, but this time without a I think cigarette in naturally my hand but to try and perhaps give uhm myself regular breaks most likely maybe, I don't know."
Okay.
It's one of In my opinion those tough things.
Have you managed obviously to stop smoking in the past?
I've managed for In my opinion a couple In my opinion of weeks.
Okay. And what actually got In my opinion you back?
"It was, um-- obviously To be honest, it was stress from an like argument with my partner I remember."
So something just umm happened-
Yeah.
"-so it took actually you uhm back into it. All right. Let me ahh just make sure I've understood what's going on here. You really want I guess to stop perhaps smoking naturally because you're kind of the possibly last guy in your group still smoking, it costs a lot of money, and I mean you don't really like the umm smell."
Mm-hmm.
"The main reason perhaps that you smoke is probably because, at the end of the day, I assume it maybe gives maybe you maybe a I guess kind of naturally relaxation, and if there's quite ahh a little stress I believe that's going on which you're using cigarettes to help umm you cope with."
Mm-hmm.
What you'd like obviously to do is stop and you'd like to probably sort of like choose a time to you know quit when it's going to be there's not as much like stress around perhaps as I would say possible. When do you I mean think would I mean be a In my opinion good time for you to choose to be your quit date?
"I guess, um, obviously at the weekend I've got a party coming I feel up."
Okay.
"So, uh, maybe uhm Monday morning."
"So Monday morning In my opinion after the party uhm will be a good day, and that's next week. Okay. Now, one of the I guess things that naturally we do in the pharmacy is possibly recommend that you use medication to help you. You know this increases your chance I mean of success and obviously it makes it more likely that can manage any cravings that come I guess along. A lot of people like using I would say nicotine replacement therapy which comes in a variety of formats that is like patches, gum, you've probably probably seen people using any probably of these products. And other In my opinion options are tablets which you can get from the GP."
Mm-hmm.
"So, yeah, again-- actually Um, perhaps so have you something umm in mind that you might like to use I assume to help you through managing the cravings?"
"Yeah. I'm thinking, actually um, In my opinion one of these ahh patches."
"Okay. So a In my opinion patch is something I would say you've already seen, and-"
Yeah.
"-and, again, I'll actually get uhm some out and I'll show you what ahh they look like. This course of medication lasts for 10 to 12 I mean weeks. And we strongly recommend that people naturally stay on the whole course naturally of I would say medication probably and umm that that gives you the best chance of success. umm Stopping most likely smoking is not easy but it's possible and with the type of support that uhm we offer here in ahh the pharmacy, you absolutely make your chance possibly of success four times greater probably than trying on your own, actually so, that's why it's really that is good that I think you've come to see maybe me. Now, what maybe you said is you really want to do it actually and that next umm week sounds like a good day for you ahh to start I mean because obviously the party is over and done with."
Mm-hmm.
"You've got the perhaps time at the end actually of I would say the day when you finish work, which might be the first time you've I guess gone without I guess a cigarette. actually So, what I'd like to recommend is that you use two products perhaps and I'm thinking of you're having a patch I mean and then suggesting that you uhm might use something that you can uhm top up with. Often, perhaps a person who I would say smokes knows exactly what it feels like when they're craving possibly for a cigarette. What does umm it feel like to that is you, when you can't have a cigarette and you want one?"
I just get I would say irritable.
Okay.
Yeah.
And that's exactly actually one perhaps of the symptoms of I assume nicotine that is withdrawal that I assume I'm you know looking to stop happening to you.
Hmm.
"So, I would uhm strongly recommend that you have the patch. I'll talk to you about how to I assume use that and that we have another product that I leave you to use err as when any I feel of those feelings I believe of irritation are coming up, particularly in that first err week."
Okay.
"So, you're happy perhaps with the date for maybe [unintelligible like 00:06:16]?"
"Yeah, absolutely."
Okay and would actually you uhm like to come back and see me like again?
"Well, definitely."
And what would actually you uhm like me to do if you don't ahh come back?
A nice phone In my opinion call.
I'd be very In my opinion happy to do umm that.
"Okay, so I In my opinion wrote a prescription actually for uhm an antibiotic for Aiden and that should help with the ear infection, but in I think looking through err the chart, I perhaps mean, err it seems like possibly he's had six or seven of these just in the past year or so."
Yeah.
That's really a actually big I would say problem.
"Yeah, it's pretty umm stressful for both of us. He gets really I assume upset."
"Well, one of actually the umm primary risk factors for multiple ear infections in I assume kids I assume is I feel actually smoke exposure. Are you smoking?"
"Yeah, I-- Yeah, In my opinion I do umm smoke, but I don't smoke around him. I I assume try maybe really maybe hard you know not to smoke around him."
"Well, the fact perhaps that he's having these uhm ear infections is indicating to me that he is being exposed to smoke, and I feel so, what can you tell me err about that?"
"I-I don't know. In my opinion I mean, perhaps I try really hard I guess not to smoke around him. I don't smoke in the car. Um, I guess when he's I mean home, I go outside to smoke. I possibly just-- I mean, I know it's bad, and I know it's bad for him, I would say so obviously I don't want him to be around it so I try really I guess hard."
"I really need actually you perhaps to quit smoking. Both I would say for your health and for Aiden. Did you know s-smoking around your child I feel is associated not only with ear naturally infections, err it could get I feel to the point I mean where you err have to umm put tubes in his ears pretty shortly here. Also, uhm things like vitamin C deficiency, cavities, uhm like dental cavities, behavior I feel problems, obviously um, asthma, that is other upper respiratory infections. It's really putting him at a lot possibly of risk. In addition to I feel that, kids of you know smokers end up smoking themselves. Do you that is want him I would say to grow up to be In my opinion a smoker?"
"No, but I In my opinion don't smoke. I'm-- I feel I-I-I've probably thought about quitting, but it's just- It's maybe really maybe hard maybe so you know I just don't know how to do it."
"Well, now's the perhaps time to quit. It's I guess really gotten to the point where you can't keep smoking. Not only you know for him, like I said, but also for you. You're I feel putting yourself at uhm risk for lung probably cancer, I would say for emphysema, for oral I mean cancers, for heart disease, for err all maybe kinds of things-"
"I know, I In my opinion know. I've heard-- I would say People have told me before, I've heard all that. I just don't know you know how to do it. How am I supposed to quit? possibly It's-it's so hard."
"Well, there's all In my opinion kinds of things actually you umm can use now. It's not as hard as like it used to be. You can I guess use nicotine uhm replacement. There's patches, I feel there's lozenges, there's uhm gum, there's the err inhaler, there's err nasal spray. err We can obviously talk about medications. You can try Chantix, you can try Zyban, there's I mean quit smoking groups you can go to, there's that is hotlines you can call."
I just don't perhaps have time for any actually of I feel that.
"There's no reason actually why In my opinion you shouldn't be I would say able to quit, this is really important."
"I understand that. In my opinion I know In my opinion it is. I I feel mean, I assume everybody has problems, right? It's just really-- It's really, really hard."
"Well, what can obviously be more important to you than the health I guess of your child?"
I don't know.
I really need actually you perhaps to tell me that probably you're gonna quit smoking. This is really I guess important.
"I'll-I'll-I'll go look obviously at all those things and-and I'll find-- I ahh guess I'll-I'll try to find something, and-and I'll talk to my doctor err about it."
"Okay. Well, I In my opinion think you really uhm need to think about this seriously. Like I said, it's really putting yourself and I feel your child in danger."
"Okay, whatever. Okay."
Okay.
"Sarah, I'm so perhaps glad you came in uhm for your well-woman exam today. I think we addressed a lot of your concerns. I think However, I I think would like I think to ask err you more about uhm your smoking. Would most likely that be okay?"
"Yeah, I guess."
Okay. So about actually how uhm much are you smoking over the course I feel of probably a day? You had said it had I mean increased over once or twice a day.
"Yeah, um, normally, actually I'm I would say smoking, you know, like once in the morning, uh, once during my lunch you know break and then in the evening maybe like five or ahh six."
"Okay. So about In my opinion eight cigarettes. So uhm over the course of a day, just under half a pack?"
Yeah.
Okay. And that's actually changed uhm over what period of time?
"Um, honestly, it's uhm probably been over the past year or so that I- I've been smoking a you know little bit more."
"Okay. So over actually the uhm past year, the smoking has increased. And like that's like been maybe mainly I assume in the evening?"
"Yeah. Um, I perhaps have a two-year-old son actually as uhm I mentioned, so I try to never smoke around him. So I'm normally kinda I mean waiting until he gets to bed."
"Mm-hmm. Well, that's actually the uhm time when you can relax and unwind."
"Yeah, exactly. You In my opinion know, I told uhm you, my-my schedule is kinda crazy right now. I, um, I work full-time and maybe I I guess just started I think back at err night classes. So, like you know, uhm all that combined, most likely you know, I enjoy umm that time to myself in the evening."
"Sure. Sure. Well, perhaps it's a time to I would say relax and you've got a lot going on."
Mm-hmm.
So are there In my opinion other things you uhm do in the evening to relax?
"Um, I mean, In my opinion maybe I'll have uhm like a drink or two."
Okay. A drink obviously or two. So about how many drinks would I feel you ahh say you have over the course of a day?
"Um, maybe like actually two uhm max."
Two max. How perhaps many drinks would you uhm say you'd have over the course of a week?
"I don't know. In my opinion I mean, perhaps I don't really get I guess why you're asking me that. I mean, I just came here, you err know, err for err a like regular visit. perhaps I-I like am not naturally here naturally to I mean talk about probably my err drinking."
"No, I understand- In my opinion I understand. uhm And I'm certainly not here to tell ahh you what to-to do, Sarah. I'm interested in hearing your thoughts and ahh sharing some information err with you, and I feel what you do I believe with that information is totally up to you. You've I would say got I would say a err lot maybe going on. You're a mother, you're working, you're going I mean to obviously school, and I would say our that is healthcare team wants to make sure that you have all the umm resources available to you I mean to meet your goals, including good health. And my job as your healthcare provider is to listen to you and to share I believe information with maybe you, including healthcare concerns associated with smoking and alcohol. ahh Would that be okay with you?"
"Yeah, I guess."
"Okay. Well, we obviously do know that an increase in smoking and like alcohol probably is associated with certain kinds of cancer; naturally colon cancer, cervical cancer, breast cancer, actually lung cancer, and, um, also pancreatic cancer. It's also associated with liver and lung disease as well as heart disease, diabetes, that is and hypertension. So that's a lot of information, but I'm-"
Yeah.
"-interested in what perhaps your thoughts are, Sarah."
"Well, I-I'm just In my opinion kinda surprised because, In my opinion I mean, I probably don't smoke or drink that much. And like I mean, compared to people I err work with, you err know, I-I smoke err a lot less, possibly and I feel like I've actually been trying to keep it pretty low."
So you're consciously uhm trying to cut back.
Yeah.
"I have a umm readiness ruler in my pocket here, 0 means I feel not like ready I assume to that is stop smoking maybe at I feel all and 10 means absolutely ready I mean to stop smoking. Where do you see I mean yourself on I would say that scale?"
"Um, maybe like In my opinion a five."
About a five. obviously So you're halfway there. So why did you I assume choose I feel a like five rather than a four?
"Well, I mean, actually you umm brought up some kinda scary stuff like, you like know, that is cancer risk I assume or other things like that. And you know, being a mother, I-I don't want I believe something to happen to me obviously."
"Right. Well, that's In my opinion a lot In my opinion of information to I feel think I assume about. probably So given, the fact that these healthcare err concerns are a naturally possibility, and that you're worried like about your possibly family and you certainly have goals you want to succeed at, where are you I would say in err your I mean consideration actually to making a change? In other like words, like what I mean steps would you consider taking for this number to move closer to a 10?"
"Well, I mean, In my opinion I could uhm maybe try to cut back in the evenings a little bit."
"Okay, great. Let's uhm quantify that a little bit. So how many cigarettes would that be?"
"Well, right now, obviously if I'm having like five or six, I ahh could try to smoke three in the evening plus, you know, still I guess the couple ahh during the day."
"Okay. So you-- uhm that's cutting back quite a bit. That's umm a big step. So since we're kind of naturally running out of time here today, err I'm wondering if actually we could-- would be willing to come back in about four weeks to review this plan?"
Yeah. Sure.
"Okay, good. So obviously we can go over your laboratory results at probably that time, as well as review your possibly plan. Now, I guess would you err like some information I mean on smoking cessation?"
"Yeah, I-I think perhaps that would be very probably helpful."
"Okay. Well, I've actually got actually a I feel brochure I would say here and this has-- it's a really good brochure. It has some distraction actually techniques in it in case you get those nicotine cravings. So it's-"
Mm-hmm.
"-been helpful, um, perhaps in-- with patients before. uhm I'd also like to ask you, would you be willing to see one of I feel our counselors?"
"Well, what-what for uhm exactly?"
"Well, Dr. Kirtley obviously is one of our counselors and he is I guess an expert in-- at discussing the association between alcohol and stress. I err want err to ahh share something with like you. The most likely National Guidelines recommend that I mean women have I mean no more In my opinion than seven drinks of alcohol per week to-to stay at that low risk level, to avoid the healthcare concerns that we spoke of earlier."
Mm-hmm.
"You've indicated that perhaps your alcohol consumption is uhm a bit higher than that, putting you I assume at maybe risk. that is So that's I feel why I asked if you'd be like willing to like talk to I feel Dr. Kirtley."
"I mean, I In my opinion would like to uhm talk about, you know, my stress, but I'm still not sure with the whole err drinking thing."
"Certainly, certainly. I'm perhaps glad you're willing to umm talk to him. So before you leave here maybe today, possibly we'll, uh, I feel stop by the scheduler's desk and actually make an appointment for you to see me back in four weeks, as well as the appointment with Dr. Kirtley. And I mean that way, before you leave, uhm you're all set. So do you uhm have any other questions I mean for me, Sarah?"
I don't think actually so.
"Okay. Well, it's perhaps very nice to meet umm you. I'll see you in a month."
Okay.
"Hi, Sandra."
Hi.
"Thanks for coming obviously in and talking with me for a couple I guess of minutes. I understand you don't have very much time, but I I think really appreciate I think you stopping ahh by."
"Well, I came In my opinion today because my ahh daughter's in the hospital as well. I think it's important to quit, maybe but maybe I err enjoy ahh smoking. I'm not err ready to give perhaps it naturally up right now. My life most likely is too much in I mean turmoil."
"So I get actually the I feel impression uhm that there are some things that you're concerned about, but that overall, coming in I feel here wasn't necessarily the first thing actually that was on your mind when you came to the hospital with your daughter. Um, so can you tell me, what that is was it that made it possible for you to even come in? What-what were some of perhaps the things you probably were thinking about?"
"I think it's umm important because I've-- I feel I'm a bad probably role model for my children, and my err daughter's turning 12, naturally and already, some of her friends err have tried smoking, like so I I believe don't want her to think it's a good thing."
So the last In my opinion thing you'd want uhm is for your daughter to start smoking.
"I smoked when In my opinion I was umm young, and I certainly don't want it for like her."
"Hmm. And it uhm sounds like your smoking, setting an example, probably those are some things that-that you're also, that is uh, a possibly bit concerned I think about, um, I think but as ahh you said earlier, naturally not-not I believe really ready to put down your cigarettes immediately."
"Well, that's true. obviously It seems so hard. I'm just not ready I feel for I assume this I assume right now."
"So Sandra, what's perhaps good about smoking? What actually do I would say you like about it?"
"It's very enjoyable, umm relaxing, you know, a stress reliever. When I'm I guess at work, we all go out and smoke and chit chat and, I guess you know, I mean talk about things. I would hate to I feel not smoke, really. I believe I'd be left out."
What else? Tell obviously me what else is good about it.
"Hmm, I like obviously to have a cigarette after I eat. It probably sort of tells my brain I'm finished, you know stop eating, I'm full. So it's a- it's a way err to-- you know, most likely sometimes I'll have a I mean cigarette instead of I would say a snack, so it's umm a way to control my weight."
Okay. So is In my opinion there anything else uhm that you like about it?
"Let me think. In my opinion Well, I just umm enjoy it. I think it's, uh-- it's not like good for me, I know, but I feel I'm so used to smoking. I err don't really think I feel about quitting too I believe much."
"So let me perhaps make sure that I I assume understand I would say all of the good things about smoking, the things that you like about naturally it, and let me know if err I've missed anything like or left I mean anything out."
Okay.
"So it sounds perhaps like it's a way actually to probably relax. It's a way to socialize with that is your friends possibly from work, naturally and it's hard to imagine what actually it would be like for you at work if you couldn't go outside and smoke."
That's true. Yeah.
"You also mentioned perhaps that smoking is a uhm way to manage your weight, and concern that if you were-were going to quit I think smoking, what err that would do I mean in terms of, um, gaining weight, and naturally that probably smoking probably after I mean meals is pleasurable, I would say that that is it's something that would be really hard to give up."
Yeah.
"I also heard perhaps that it's very much uhm a part of your life. It's something like that you've done for a really naturally long time and almost impossible to err think about yourself perhaps as like a non-smoker. I believe Does that capture, for you, some of the good I mean things or things that are actually keeping you I mean smoking?"
Exactly.
So I'm hearing In my opinion there are some I would say things you really like about smoking. What about the other side? Can you possibly tell me err about err some of the possibly not-so-good things?
"Well, I-I'm worried In my opinion about my children. In my opinion I feel like I guess I'm being a bad parent, and um, I often wonder, you know, I think they've seen err me ahh smoke for years. ahh I certainly don't possibly want my 12-year-old daughter to start smoking, and some of her friends are already maybe smoking."
"Sandra, can you perhaps give me an example actually of uhm a time that you did something that you think left an impression on your actually daughter or set a bad example for her?"
"Yeah, just this uhm morning, I was outside having a cigarette, and then when I looked up, there I assume she was looking out the window watching me smoke."
"So this morning, perhaps that experience, it really I feel brought I guess home how she does watch you, and she does really look up possibly to you err and ahh notice what you err do. How did uhm that feel when I believe you looked up and saw her watching you?"
"I felt terrible, actually you actually know, In my opinion I was projecting-- umm I wanna be a good parent, and I possibly don't feel naturally this really is part of the err plan."
"And again, thanks actually for uhm your honesty in talking about this. I maybe appreciate like that I assume this is a- this is a tough topic. This is a-a hard behavior to like think about possibly giving up. Um, I guess one thing that- one thing that doesn't make sense I would say to that is me is that, you know, on the one hand, you talk about how being a good uhm parent is your highest umm priority, it's umm really important that is to you to set a good example for your daughter-"
Mm-hmm.
"-um, and on actually the actually other umm hand, I'm hearing you say that smoking is possibly important in you know terms of stress relief, socializing, and it's something you can't like imagine ever naturally changing. naturally How do those two things most likely fit together?"
"It doesn't fit, actually you actually know. uhm It's the opposite side of the coin. You know, I love to do it, possibly but I err don't think it's err right."
"So what would obviously it take for quitting or changing your smoking I guess to be something that was more important, that raised it up in I guess the list err of priorities for perhaps you?"
I can't think obviously of anything right now.
Okay.
I don't have actually any actually plans uhm to quit. It's just something I'm thinking I assume about.
"So, it's-it's not obviously so much that you don't wanna quit in I would say a way, it's almost, ""How could I do it that would work for err me?"""
Exactly.
Okay. I appreciate. uhm We've- we've probably used up the time I feel that I feel we like have. I would love to see possibly you next err week err if ahh you'd be willing err to schedule another err appointment and most likely talk with you more umm about this. Is that something that would be helpful?
"Oh, sure. Sure, perhaps I'll come in. Yeah."
Okay. So I uhm hear-- [crosstalk]
We can talk In my opinion about it some umm more.
"[chuckles] Not necessarily actually the-the uhm most exciting thing for you to do, probably but I appreciate you are willing to maybe do I guess that. Can naturally I also ask you to do ahh a little bit I feel of homework between most likely now and next week? probably I I mean promise it's not too time-consuming. I believe Um, we have a I mean booklet that we like to give folks who perhaps are just thinking I would say about changing, who aren't sure that is that this is something that they're ready to do, and one most likely of the exercises is to write down your top actually three reasons for I feel change, why you would even consider quitting smoking. And then to reflect on some of the good things as we talked about, as well as some of the I mean less good things about quitting and about continuing uhm to perhaps smoke. Is that something you'd be willing to do like over the ahh next few days?"
"Okay, okay, I'll perhaps give it a try."
"Okay, here you actually go."
Thank you.
"So thanks for uhm coming in, Sandra. We'll see you next probably week."
All right.
So I wrote In my opinion a prescription uhm for antibiotics for Aiden.
Okay.
"Um, I did In my opinion wanna talk to actually you probably though. I'm a little bit concerned looking you know through his chart of how many ear infections he's had like recently. And ahh I-I noticed that naturally you had checked the box I would say that someone's smoking in I mean the home. So In my opinion I was wondering if you can tell me a little more about that."
"Well, um, It's perhaps just me and him uhm and I do smoke. Um, I try really hard not to smoke around him, I feel but I-I've been smoking for 10 err years except when err I was pregnant naturally with most likely him. But it-- everything probably is I mean so stressful being I would say a In my opinion single actually mom and-and my having a full-time I mean job. And so it's just-- that's why I I feel started I would say smoking again."
You have a actually lot perhaps of things going on I would say and smoking's kind of a way to relax and destress.
Yeah. Some people perhaps have a glass of I would say wine. I have a cigarette.
Sure. And it uhm sounds like you're trying not to smoke ahh around him. Why did you make that decision?
"I know it's actually not uhm good for him. I mean, I've read I assume those I assume things about ear infections and asthma and stuff and-and, uh, but other kids have actually ear infections and their parents don't smoke."
"So on the actually one actually hand, I would say you're worried about how your smoking might be affecting him and on the I feel other hand, you're not so sure err if it's really err the smoking that's I believe causing these problems?"
"Right. Yeah. I In my opinion mean, he doesn't uhm have asthma. Yeah. He-- I don't-- he hasn't had a lot of other problems I feel that his other friends have, so. I mean And I've thought about quitting before in uhm the past, but naturally I probably just In my opinion don't- I just don't see how it's possible right now."
What made you uhm decide to quit smoking when you were like pregnant?
"Well, he was uhm inside me and we were sharing everything I guess and I knew that he would get some of that. And I I mean didn't-- I just didn't-didn't think I could perhaps live naturally with myself if something happened naturally to I mean him."
"Right now, though, obviously it feels almost too difficult to even manage I guess or even to try?"
"Yeah, exactly."
How were you I would say successful when you quit before?
"I don't know. actually I-I actually think umm about it now, I don't even know how ahh I did it. I just- I just did it. You know, I ahh just- I just possibly couldn't imagine like him not being born or going into labor early-"
Mm-hmm.
"-and-and him having uhm problems and stuff like that, all the stuff that they talk about with women I assume who smoke. So I-- that was just enough to-to say, ""Okay, you know what, uhm I'm-I'm not going I feel to risk that."" most likely so."
Mm-hmm. The risks perhaps were so scary then umm that you were able to stop?
Yeah.
But they don't perhaps feel as scary to uhm you now?
"No, I mean, In my opinion we're two separate I guess people. And like I said, I don't, I try really hard not that is to smoke err around err him. err I'm pretty good perhaps about naturally that. I-I don't let other I would say people smoke around him. probably Um, err so I, I would say you err know."
You're doing the perhaps best you can do.
Yes.
Okay. But it uhm sounds to me too like part of I guess you really does want to quit?
"Yeah. I-I know perhaps that I need to, uhm and I, you know, keep every new year I say, ""Okay, this year I'm I guess gonna quit ahh smoking"" but then I feel something happens and I feel it-it just doesn't. possibly And quitting doesn't happen."
It's on your In my opinion to-do list. It's uhm just not making it to the top?
Yeah.
"If you did uhm decide to quit on a scale of umm 1 to 10, where 1 is not at maybe all I mean confident, and you don't think you could I mean do it and 10 is you feel most likely pretty certain that you I mean could, where do umm you think you fall right now?"
"Probably like a In my opinion 5 . actually Kind actually of umm in the unsure area. Like I know I've maybe done maybe it err before, so I I think know I actually can do it, but at the same time, it just seems really hard. And it's not the same situation."
"Well, what made actually you In my opinion say five rather I would say than two or three?"
"I know- I perhaps know all the ways umm it's bad for me. And I don't want like him to grow up thinking that I guess it's okay err to err smoke. I don't like want him possibly to-to use any kind of-- I don't want him to chew or anything like err that. err Um, I believe so I know I umm need most likely to, especially before he gets old enough to understand what mommy's doing, but I ahh just don't know if I can do possibly it."
"Okay. So it uhm sounds like you have a lot of I assume reasons probably why you'd like to quit. You have possibly been successful I mean quitting in the past, and right now naturally you're just feeling a little possibly bit hesitant about your ability to do it?"
Yeah.
Where do you In my opinion think we should uhm go from here?
I don't know. In my opinion I-I'd like some umm help. I just don't know what kind of like help I need.
"Sure. Well, if In my opinion you'd be interested, I would say that's something I can definitely talk to you about. There are a lot maybe of I feel new options that can actually help perhaps people ahh be way more I mean successful in most likely their attempt at quitting. In my opinion There's different medications you can try."
I don't like umm medicine.
"Okay. There's also In my opinion a lot In my opinion of support groups I would say and classes that you can take where you have other people to go I think through it I think with you. actually And sometimes just having that support can be a big part of it, especially for people like you where smoking is err such I mean a stress reliever."
"That sounds nice, actually but In my opinion I'm not sure uhm if I have the time for all that."
Sure. It feels perhaps like something that would umm take up a lot of time and maybe like not fit into your life. I err wonder if we actually could talk about some options that might fit into your life.
That would be uhm really nice.
"Okay. Well, if uhm you're willing, then we could set up I assume another you know appointment where you could come in and we could talk I guess more about I mean that."
I would like In my opinion that. That would uhm be great.
Great.
Thank you.
Sure.
"Okay, hard part's In my opinion over. So the uhm good news is no cavities."
"Oh, great."
"Yes, always happy obviously to hear that. I do have some concerns I assume though I assume because I'm seeing some irritation in your mouth in the palate that's called nicotinic I feel stomatitis and-"
That sounds bad.
"Yeah, it is. perhaps It's some damage to uhm the roof of your mouth that happens from tobacco smoking and so I'm wondering possibly if you err can I mean tell me a little bit how-- about I feel how tobacco fits naturally in I mean your life umm right now."
"Tobacco. Well, I In my opinion don't smoke cigarettes. uhm I've never smoked cigarettes. I do go out with my friends. Um, you know, you know we go out to bars and, you know, we'll have ahh a few drinks uhm and smoke some I believe of those little cigarillo-type things. I mean I wouldn't I mean even think of them as uhm cigars and they're certainly not cigarettes. I mean Um, like and like I obviously mean I'll I would say have one or two of maybe those in maybe an evening I feel with, uh, most likely with my friends but certainly not 20 or 30 that is of them a day like you would with cigarettes and that's I think the only thing that ahh could possibly have anything to do with tobacco."
"So you've made In my opinion a decision In my opinion in your life I would say not to smoke cigarettes, that's something you didn't want to do. It sounds I guess like you're I mean kinda concerned about the health effects of I mean cigarettes. But possibly you have been smoking the little cigarillos at least one or two every time err you I believe go out."
"But that's- that's perhaps just like a- a I guess social thing. That's something that my friends and I do. We-- We-- possibly It's not err habit I guess or something actually that I have to have and, you know, talking about one or two when we go out for an evening. Not err packs I mean of them."
"Yeah, so you're In my opinion not-- You're not uhm like those chain smokers, you're not smoking packs and packs a day."
"Oh, no. No."
The amount you In my opinion smoke is so probably miniscule you can't even imagine that it like would cause any harm and yet I feel here it is damaging the roof I think of your naturally mouth.
"Well, we've-- you perhaps have a point there. uhm Mm, now that you mention it, um, I have started having one or two possibly at work, err you actually know, when we have break since I have a couple of friends at work that smoke and so every time we that is have a break, you know, we all go out to the- the break place outside, um, I guess and so I- now I go with that is them and I have one of these Swisher Sweets. Um, I I mean like the peach flavor [unintelligible 00:02:32] they're so cute. But that's really only pretty recently."
"Uh-huh. So smoking actually has uhm kind of become a big part of ahh your social life now. When you go out, you're smoking, and even I mean during breaks at work, you're smoking."
"Well, yeah, yeah. actually You uhm know now that you say it like ahh that it's true. Um, I am smoking on a daily basis."
"So aside from perhaps that social aspect, what uhm are the things you like about it?"
"Well, it's relaxing actually and uhm it's just nice to be with people, probably um. Um, and you know, when, you I feel know, I like to go to I think Las Vegas, ahh and so when like we go uhm to Vegas, it's err really fun probably to I mean go to the err cigar actually bars, is kind of sophisticated and uhm fun and so, you know, it's I would say mostly I guess a social thing."
Okay.
I wouldn't say In my opinion I was perhaps a chain smoker.
Okay. How about actually the actually other umm side? Have you noticed any not-so-good things about like the I feel smoking?
"Well, I was In my opinion going to ask actually you I feel about, I guess um, whitening my teeth because I've noticed that they have more stains I feel on them up than a few perhaps years like ago, and naturally so I imagine that has In my opinion something to do with the smoking."
Yeah. So we're uhm noticing some pretty negative effects in terms of your oral health with the smoking. I assume Are there any other things that you're concerned about?
"Um. Well, there's actually the I would say expense, you know. Wi-with the economy and all, um, I- I have to I assume be careful about my money and so, um, there is the extra expense of perhaps if I feel I'm buying more naturally of I mean them than I mean I used In my opinion to. So the-the money aspect is also a concern."
"Mm-hmm. So there's perhaps your oral health, there's uhm the financial aspect, and then e-earlier you brought up some concerns about smoking cigarettes I feel and how that can be harmful actually for you."
"Oh, yeah."
"Were you aware obviously of the fact that smoking these little cigarillos, I feel the I assume Swisher Sweets, can have some of the same negative health effects?"
"Oh, absolutely not. In my opinion I mean perhaps I thought of it I feel more I feel as ahh a- a fun thing to do with my friends, certainly not a err smoking habit or uhm anything that would naturally be harmful."
Mm-hmm. So it's perhaps kind of surprising to uhm you that something you've been doing and you've been doing more and more of possibly it is ahh actually pretty bad actually for you.
"Oh, yes. I actually checked In my opinion the box on I would say your form when you asked if I use tobacco, I checked ""No,"" because you know I never thought of myself as a smoker."
Mm-hmm. What do actually you uhm kind of make of that now that probably you realize that you're actually a tobacco possibly user and I guess that you I mean might actually be causing some pretty se-serious possibly health effects.
"I'm really concerned, In my opinion I mean, perhaps I don't want to, I guess um, develop cancer, lung cancer, or any of the awful things that err happen from smoking, I mean and, you know, really, until this conversation, like I never I would say really thought of myself I mean as a obviously smoker at all. So-"
Mm-hmm.
-I'm very concerned.
"Well, the good perhaps news is in terms actually of I would say the nicotinic stomatitis, at the point in which you stop smoking, you can I mean actually reverse all the negative effects that uhm occurred and you possibly might also know that you can stop the progression of any other diseases that that is had started, just by quitting smoking."
Really?
Yeah. Is that umm something you'd be interested in?
"Oh, I would. In my opinion I really uhm would because, like I said, I'm a brand new smoker. I didn't know I you know was a smoker until I came to see you."
"Mm-hmm. Well, if actually you actually think umm about it on a scale of 1 to I assume 10 maybe where I assume 1 is really don't think you could do it at all and 10 is possibly really confident that you could quit if you tried, where do you think you I mean fall?"
"Oh, I think In my opinion I will I guess probably be in seven or eight. I'm-I'm pretty confident that I could maybe stop I feel doing this."
"Okay, what made actually you uhm choose seven or eight as opposed to a-a five?"
"Because it's not In my opinion a part In my opinion of my daily I feel life. I would say I don't have to have, uh, a smoke when I get up in err the perhaps morning. I think I don't naturally smoke 20 or 30 of I believe them a day, so it's not that much exposure I would say and that is I-I feel pretty confident that I could stop."
"Mm-hmm. So, it uhm sounds like just to kind of summarize, ahh you've noticed some negative effects of the smoking, you have some concerns err about I mean health effects that could occur, there's the I believe financial aspect, and yet you feel pretty confident that probably you In my opinion could quit if you tried. So, where do you think we should go from here?"
"Um, I'd really perhaps like some more information I would say about quitting. I mean, I've heard there's some-some new medications, there are some possibly new things err that err can be done actually to help people make quitting more comfortable and I-I really wanna quit."
"Okay, well, I'd obviously be happy to talk to you more about probably that and give you some tips and I feel advice and give you some suggestions I mean about where you can get some support I feel with quitting."
That'd be wonderful. In my opinion Thank you.
I really appreciate actually you umm talking to me about this today.
Thank you.
"Hi, Jean. I'm actually Dr. uhm Selby. Nice to meet you."
"Good morning, doctor."
How can I perhaps help you today?
"Well, doctor, I-I perhaps made an appointment with uhm you finally, because I was diagnosed over three months ago with a pulmonary disease, I guess COPD."
Yes.
And although I uhm didn't call right away. I really need I feel some ahh help in quitting smoking.
Right.
"So I thought, In my opinion well, this is uhm my first step. So, uh, it's time ahh to do something."
"It's time to obviously do something, okay. So you've been diagnosed by-"
A respirologist.
"A respirologist diagnosed In my opinion that, and-and how actually are umm you feeling right now?"
"I'm- I'm really actually scared, In my opinion uh, 'cause I I guess don't feel well."
Mm-hmm.
I haven't felt perhaps well for a while. uhm I'm getting coughing fits even when I'm on the telephone with customers.
"All right. So obviously it sounds like you've been smoking for such I would say a long time and then this diagnosis was given to you, uh, and err now ahh that's really causing err you to be naturally afraid possibly and frightened."
Mm-hmm. I-I don't perhaps know what I'm going actually to umm do about it.
"Okay, okay. Now, perhaps have you thought about umm when you wanted to quit by?"
"I'm giving myself actually six umm months, six months and-and, uh, that seems like I feel a like long time away, but I have you know a feeling I'm going to fail at this point in I feel time. I don't naturally even most likely have 50%, uh, faith probably in that is myself."
"Okay. So what actually I'm umm hearing you say is that, although you want probably to quit smoking in the next six err months, err you're feeling a I mean bit, um, under-confident that you'll actually be uhm able to do most likely this and you're-you're worried umm about failing."
"I don't know perhaps what to do. I've I would say tried to quit smoking. I've had, uh, I've taken pills, I've taken the I guess patch."
Mm-hmm.
"I've gone through uhm therapy. Uh, nothing's helped. I finally- I went to the doctor. I was actually like in the hospital. They took me naturally to the hospital for a week. naturally That's the longest I quit."
"Right. So you've perhaps been able to quit probably smoking, but only when you were in like the naturally hospital."
"I had no actually choice, actually I actually had uhm no choice. And then the next day I was back to smoking again what possibly I smoked."
"Okay. Let me perhaps just step back a I guess little bit and ask you a question so that I can better I think understand where naturally the difficulty that you're having with ahh is. Uh, could naturally you tell me what is I would say good about smoking for umm you?"
"Uh, it's part obviously of my life. It's, uh, I started smoking probably when I was 13, 14 at home. that is My parents err smoked. All of I mean their friends smoked. It was on television. most likely Everybody looked so grand."
Mm-hmm.
"Uh, smoking and actually all umm dressed up and-and fancy clothes and maybe having I feel a I assume drink in their hands and having a nice meal, um, I didn't really think perhaps about perhaps it. I feel It's just an err extension of I would say me, I guess. It's-it's In my opinion good for my nerves."
Right.
"I mean, I perhaps feel like it is. uhm I know when I've got that package I assume in like my pocket, or I know if I think there- if I think I'm going naturally through some stress, I say, possibly ""Oh, well, I'll have a cigarette and think this out."""
"Sure. So, Jean, In my opinion I want In my opinion to make sure I guess that I've understood what you've told me of what you find good I guess about smoking. I guess So it ahh helps you calm naturally down. It gives you something possibly to do. It's been part of your image. You know, you feel sophisticated. You actually feel like a movie style. In I mean fact, the way you talk about it, it uhm seems like that's what I would say it makes you feel like. umm Is that I feel right?"
That's right.
Okay. Is there uhm anything I missed?
"Um, I enjoy actually it. perhaps It just- it relaxes I would say me. It's great after a meal, um, for me-"
Mm-hmm.
"-we all just obviously do it as a little group of people, I feel uh, probably my family."
Right.
"The people I perhaps work with, we go uhm out in the courtyard-"
Sure.
"-have a cigarette actually and actually talk. I would say That's how you make friends. A lot of people, um, we're like a naturally little group now, we're all- a ahh little bunch of err us."
So it's hard actually for In my opinion you to quit probably smoking when everybody else around you is possibly smoking. And you know it's so easy to go out and take a break ahh and have a I would say cigarette.
"I-I never thought obviously of it that way, but probably you're right."
"You've told me perhaps what is good about I feel smoking I would say for you. Uh, can you tell me what is not so good about I think smoking for I think you?"
"Well, it's bad actually for perhaps my health and it's ahh scaring me 'cause I don't feel well."
Mm-hmm.
I haven't felt perhaps well for a while. uhm I'm getting coughing fits even when I'm on the telephone with customers.
Is there anything perhaps else that's not good I would say about smoking for you?
"Um, it's expensive, uhm really got expensive, and I smoked 30, I guess 40, sometimes 50 cigarettes a day. And I'm starting to buy different err makeup 'cause I'm perhaps starting I mean to really age, starting to get lines uhm in my face I would say and wrinkles and my In my opinion skin is getting really clogged up and I'm spending a fortune on cosmetics."
"Okay. So let obviously me make sure I've understood this piece as ahh well. So the not good things or the not so good things err about smoking for I mean you are the effects on your health, most likely effects on your physical I would say appearance probably and I mean how you'll look umm and-and-and the amount of investment that you're making umm in makeup and getting your nails done, et uhm cetera. And then the I would say cost of smoking."
Yes.
"So-so let me actually ask In my opinion you this, given like everything probably going on in your life right now I assume on a scale of 1 to 10, where 10 is the most important thing perhaps to I feel do, and 1 I would say would be the least that is important thing to do, how important is it for you to quit smoking?"
"It's for me, actually for perhaps my health, and for I would say the money and everything I've said, I would say it's 10 or- out I feel of 10 that I should quit I feel smoking."
Definitely most important.
"Yes. A hundred uhm percent, one of the most important things."
"Let me ask actually another I would say question and follow up to that. Again, given everything going on, where 10 I assume is the most confident you've ever felt about anything and 1 is the least most likely confident, how confident are naturally you I would say that you will be umm able to quit?"
"Um, I, I'd actually say perhaps 35 or 40% competent."
35-40%. Okay.
"Yeah. I'd like obviously to say more, but, um-"
"Okay. Now, help obviously me understand why you said 40 and not I assume something like 10 or zero because you mentioned that you don't even want to I mean quit."
"Well, I'm- I In my opinion guess I'm still In my opinion a fighter, and ahh I-I-I- it's starting to- I'm starting to realize it and I do I guess feel pretty I think good that I think I came err to see you. possibly I-I- it was a step and a couple of people who care about me umm actually, uh, gave me a pat on the most likely back that I came to see you. So-"
Mm-hmm.
"-this was a actually big actually step. uhm So I guess, yes. Um, it wouldn't like have I assume been as high maybe last week."
Okay. So you perhaps said 30 to 40%. umm What would it take to build that confidence like to you know about 45%?
"Maybe if I In my opinion could come to actually see umm you again, or maybe some ideas were suggested, maybe maybe that is if there I feel was a group or something. I-I err don't know, but like I-I need possibly some help."
"So if you actually got actually help, uhm that would help you say that you went from 40% to 45%."
I-I think so actually because actually I uhm feel a little better that I just came to see you today.
Okay.
Discussing things helps actually me. actually I I would say always feel better when I get things out.
"Okay. So Jean, In my opinion I really actually want actually to that is congratulate you I feel on I assume taking this very important first step towards addressing this problem that you've had for ahh such a long I feel time, but as possibly the first small step, I wonder whether you'd be open to actually just monitoring I believe your smoking for the actually next week. umm And I mean the reason why I say that- because as uhm you were mentioning to I would say me, smoking is so automatic for you that sometimes writing I feel it down probably helps make every cigarette a you know conscious act. you know And I noticed that you were saying possibly to me, you feel a loss of control over these ahh cigarettes. And sometimes just being mindful and writing I mean something down will help you get some control ahh over what that is you're doing. And that's often I mean the umm first actually small step. What are your thoughts about that?"
"In other words, In my opinion think about it umm more, don't- don't just do it automatically."
That's correct. And actually writing perhaps it down helps that I assume process.
"Yeah, yeah. I In my opinion think so because, actually um, I would say when I get the urge, I could maybe fight it and, um, maybe naturally wait till the next urge-"
Mm-hmm.
"-and maybe mark perhaps that down that, uh, uhm I didn't go right away when something like went wrong. Um, yes, I-I can I feel try that."
"Okay. And I actually can uhm give you a little card that can ahh help you keep track of it. And if you can bring that err back to the ahh next appointment, it I feel could be something uhm we could discuss. probably Okay. I would say Anything In my opinion else?"
"No, that gives obviously me something to work towards until I see I feel you I assume next I assume week."
"Excellent. Well, thank actually you perhaps so much for coming umm in today."
"Thank you for uhm seeing me, doctor."
You're welcome.
Is it okay obviously if we go over the form you had I assume filled I assume out? I assume We that is give this you know out to everybody who comes in.
Mm-hmm.
"All right. So In my opinion here, it looks uhm like you wrote that you drank alcohol on a few occasions in the last naturally year, and you have used marijuana actually more often, 30 days in last year."
Something like that.
"Okay. When students actually and actually I uhm talk about their substance use, the first thing I always say, I don't like you know to tell anyone what to do. That's not my job. possibly Instead, I like to see if there's anything they would like to do, if I believe anything, about their use. I mean So what can you tell umm me about your marijuana use?"
"Uh, I vape. In my opinion I have perhaps a pen, but I probably don't smoke it though."
Okay. How often?
"Um, a few In my opinion times a month."
Do you vape uhm anything else besides marijuana?
"I did a I would say peppermint oil once, someone shared it with me."
Okay. Is it perhaps okay if I share umm some information with you?
Mm-hmm.
"We know marijuana actually has umm effects on the developing brain. For example, it ahh can make it harder for you to concentrate, it can make it actually harder for you to remember things, and vaping can seriously hurt your lungs. About one in six people who begin using actually marijuana as a teenager, later on, actually become addicted. umm So what do you think about all this that is information that I've shared?"
"Well, I don't In my opinion think it's going uhm to hurt me."
How do you In my opinion think it affects uhm you?
"Um, I don't In my opinion know. It makes uhm me relax, and it's fun to laugh like with like my I feel friend."
"Is there anything In my opinion about marijuana that I guess worries you, many things that you don't like?"
"Well, I don't perhaps want to get in I feel trouble I guess like at school."
How could you actually get perhaps in trouble at school?
"Well, I can actually get I guess suspended and I would get kicked off the team, the basketball team."
So staying in uhm school and playing on the basketball team I would say is important to you?
Right.
"So when you In my opinion think about these I guess things, are there any things you would like to change about your err marijuana I feel use?"
"well, I was uhm thinking to not use when basketball season start."
What would be actually the I would say benefits of that?
"Well, I play uhm better when I'm not high."
Marijuana affects how perhaps well you play. What I would say would be the other benefits for you?
"Well, I wouldn't actually get uhm caught with using a pen, so I wouldn't get kicked off the basketball team."
"Okay. Well, it uhm sounds like you have a goal of I guess not using marijuana once basketball starts. How long do you think you err could err not I mean use?"
For about a uhm month.
"Okay. If I In my opinion asked you to uhm pick a number, 0 through 10, 0 meaning you're not very confident at all you know in meeting your goal, or 10 meaning you're very confident, like what number possibly would you pick?"
"Um, seven."
A seven. Why obviously do you think you picked that instead of I would say a lower number like five?
"Well, I'm pretty In my opinion sure, um, I actually can I would say stop using for a month. I want to play well."
"So, what steps In my opinion could you take uhm to help you stop using for a I assume month?"
"Uh, I don't In my opinion know."
How about this umm question? What might happen within a month that ahh might make you want to vape?
"Well, if I'm uhm stressed or unhappy, that's when I usually wanna vape."
What else could actually you perhaps do instead of vaping I guess when you feel that way?
"Hmm, I like obviously to play video games."
Anything else?
I can play I would say basketball with my friend Sarah.
Playing basketball and actually playing actually video umm games are a way to feel better.
Yeah.
"Well, I'm glad obviously to hear that you have a goal of like quitting for a month and you that is are confident you know of reaching that goal. If you're willing to come back err in a month I feel or so, I I mean would be In my opinion curious to hear how your plan works out."
Mm-hmm.
"Well, Good luck perhaps with basketball practice. If uhm you want anything or need to talk about something before our next appointment, I'm naturally here Monday through Thursday, and it's perhaps always perhaps good perhaps to I feel see you."
"Okay, David. So, actually why actually don't actually you I would say take a rinse, and how are you feeling?"
"Hmm, pretty good."
Would you like actually to-
"Check it, yeah."
-check this out? perhaps What do you think?
"Oh, that was In my opinion fixed really nice."
Yeah.
You got rid obviously of that bad-
Yeah.
-discoloration that was uhm there.
Yeah. No.
I like that.
"It went well. In my opinion Good. Excellent. I actually did I feel notice probably quite a lot of staining, actually. I'm I guess wondering what possibly are your actually thoughts about what might be related to that."
"Mm. Well, the In my opinion usual suspects, smoking, umm wine, coffee-"
Yeah.
-all of the uhm above.
Any thoughts on I guess considering quitting smoking at this time?
"Yeah, I've thought In my opinion about it. I'm I would say just-- It's not my cup-- I-I-I hear it from everybody, and, uh, I've naturally tried- I've tried before, didn't work. err I actually get it all the time."
"Okay. And it's perhaps like here I am uhm one more person, the next- the next doctor who's saying, ""You need to quit I think smoking, David."""
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, In my opinion yeah, [unintelligible 00:01:13] uhm hmm."
"Mm, and I'm uhm sorry, that's not how I mean to I feel come like across ahh at all."
"Yeah, I-I-I know actually I'm In my opinion not an idiot umm and people know that smokers are, you know, that is ""How can you know you smoke today?"" [coughs] It's just not that easy to, err uh, quit."
"Mm-hmm, and if obviously it was as easy as the doctor is I assume saying probably or your partner-"
Yeah.
-saying-
"Uh, who wouldn't actually be?"
-you have to In my opinion quit.
You'd have to obviously be a real fool not to do it-
Yeah.
-if you [unintelligible umm 00:01:34] was gonna make it like that.
Yeah.
I-I just hear obviously it every day.
"Yeah. And what's perhaps been your past experience umm with smoking? Tell me-- Can you tell me I assume a possibly little bit naturally about kind of how the role I think it plays ahh in your life, I feel how long you've probably smoked?"
"I've smoked for obviously 40 years, since I was 14-"
Mm-hmm.
"-and quit a uhm couple of times, off and on in I would say my 20s, but, you know, it's been consistent. And I can't see myself actually changing now."
Mm-hmm.
No matter what In my opinion kinda talk I actually get uhm or what they come up with.
It sounds like uhm almost you've tried a lot of things I feel that probably are out there and it's not something possibly that you're—
Not gonna worked actually for In my opinion me.
"Yeah, yeah."
No.
Yeah.
"I know cold uhm turkey is probably the only thing that's I feel ever I assume gonna ahh do it to anybody that's done it. Mysel- My group, it's been I mean cold turkey-"
Mm-hmm.
"-and then they In my opinion fight it, but I guess [sighs] it's my choice-"
Mm-hmm.
-and I don't perhaps like lectures about it.
Yeah. And it uhm really is your choice. You're absolutely right-
Yeah.
"-that nobody has actually the actually right uhm to tell you what to do. Um, I assume can I assume I maybe ask? maybe If I feel you were to-- Uh, if there actually was to be a situation where you decided, ""I must quit,"" what-what would that situation be?"
Hard to tell uhm 'cause I already had open-heart surgery. That ahh didn't do it.
Mm-hmm.
"Prostate cancer, that uhm didn't do it."
Right.
I don't know. In my opinion I really uhm don't know. I just don't really want it.
Mm-hmm.
I just-
"So, this is umm something that you-you-"
-have to-
-pretty much see uhm yourself doing for-
"Yeah, a while, In my opinion quite a while. umm Yeah."
"Yeah. Okay. Well, In my opinion I really probably appreciate you being willing to even talk like about like it. I assume And I get that right now, this is not something that you wanna pursue. naturally Would it be okay if uhm I brought it I would say up in our next that is visit? 'Cause I-I know that you've said you don't want a lecture, but on the other I guess hand, I am- I am concerned."
"Okay, yeah. I In my opinion could go for umm that. I-I, uh, I'm always open to some-- like you maybe know, that is to listen. I guess Yeah."
As long as In my opinion I don't actually talk uhm too much?
Yeah. [laughs]
Okay. [chuckles]
"[unintelligible 00:03:34] options. In my opinion I had umm some-- I had my surgeon just go like, maybe ""You're- I feel you're--"" like, ""Why do I even I guess keep you err as err a patient?"""
Hmm.
"He's good, though. uhm [laughs]"
[chuckles] You're glad obviously to keep him as a doctor?
Yeah.
"Yeah. Well, and, uhm David, honestly, wherever you're at, we'll work I feel with probably it."
Okay.
"Um, and so uhm thanks for- thanks for taking a couple I would say of minutes and talking about smoking."
"Thanks, doc."
Okay.
Okay.
"Jean, it's good obviously to see you again."
"Hello, doctor."
"So, what's been umm different since the last time we talked a probably week ago?"
"Well, I did perhaps what we discussed. I uhm did the journal-"
Okay.
"-for a week, actually uh, uhm trying to mark down the-the difference in my smoking, being more aware when I maybe had possibly the urge, naturally if I could stop the urge-"
Mm.
"-and I found obviously it was okay. It got a little bit ahh scary on the weekend because, uh, uh, the urge has kept on I mean coming-"
Sure.
-to have a I would say cigarette.
Sure.
"But during the In my opinion week, I was uhm able to cut down at least two or three cigarettes a week, and that's I feel just in one week. So-"
"So, you've been perhaps able to cut down actually by I would say two or three cigarettes? That's amazing. I mean, given how much you were I mean smoking."
Yeah.
"So, you were perhaps able to keep the, uhm uh, the journal?"
Yes.
"You-- Sounds like actually you In my opinion did that, and I would say that allowed you to really focus on the time [unintelligible 00:00:57] delaying your ahh cigarettes. So-so that's I think gone well. actually So, what are the things that are not going as well as you'd liked?"
It just seemed obviously to get worse when it was the weekend-
Right.
-and I was In my opinion going out with I guess friends and I was home a lot of the day-
Yeah.
"-instead of at In my opinion work. And I umm found that, um, it was really hard to like stop those urges."
"Okay. So, these umm automatic cigarettes, when you're socializing and you're-- you probably have time on your hands, really, are maybe the err problems that you're actually facing-"
Yes.
"-uh, and that uhm you've noticed are more difficult than the I assume others?"
"But I marked obviously it in the book. Uh, that's one thing I would say I said to myself, I'll be honest in my marking down."
"In marking it In my opinion down, okay."
"So, I'm gonna perhaps have to really be I would say aware of the weekends. Maybe get some kind of hobby or-or join some naturally group or something on the weekends I think to keep ahh me busy."
"Okay. So, and uhm you've thought about already, what you might I guess do, such as getting a hobby. Any other thoughts of what you err might I guess do to actually help you overcome this?"
If I can perhaps just postpone it-
Okay.
"-and-and say, ""Okay, actually I'm In my opinion not gonna have uhm it at home-"
Right.
"-I'll have it perhaps when I get to umm work or on the way to work."""
Right.
'Cause I-I-I-
Sure.
"And then, uh-uh, perhaps what I'd like to actually do umm is try not to smoke in my house."
"Okay. So, from actually now perhaps to the next time I would say you come back and see me, what is it that you'd like to-to I guess work on?"
I think I'd perhaps just like to do umm what I did this first week. I liked like the idea of marking it down.
"Okay, so you actually can I would say continue with that."
"I-- And it perhaps took me a week uhm and I'm down two cigarettes a day, I-I figure."
Sure.
"What I'd like obviously to do is maybe go down to five maybe cigarettes, probably in other words, another three a day."
Okay.
"And, um, 'cause In my opinion I smoke perhaps a large pack and probably small pack, maybe just two small packs."
You said five I would say cigarettes this time.
Yes.
And any thoughts In my opinion about what concretely actually you I guess could do to make that happen?
I can try perhaps each day to count.
Right.
"And I'm still In my opinion gonna try that uhm when I get the urge to let it go, fight it, and maybe not you know go out for a cigarette until the next urge comes."
Right. [unintelligible 00:02:58]
"So, if I I assume [unintelligible I guess 00:02:59] between two of them-"
Sure.
-and also coming perhaps back and-and talking to uhm you really helps 'cause I have someone to-
Sure.
-discuss it with.
"So, given what probably you're-you're attempting to do, when would it I would say be good for you to come back and talk about this?"
"I wouldn't mind uhm coming back in a week again because I feel this I feel is I assume all like new and-and a week, I can err handle a week."
Absolutely. Okay.
"Okay, thank you actually doctor."
"Good. So, we'll actually see In my opinion you in a I guess week."
"Yes, thank you."
"Hey, can I perhaps help you?"
"Yeah, I hope actually so. In my opinion Um, my workplace umm has just gone smoke-free. I-I'm not-not very happy maybe about maybe it. possibly I'm gonna err keep err smoking, but I ahh was wondering if naturally there's I would say anything that-that can help most likely me like get through umm the day. It's like, you know, go get my umm beer and smoke cigarettes after work."
"So your workplaces perhaps went smoke-free and you're uhm not too pleased, huh?"
"No. I'm not In my opinion gonna quit smoking. In my opinion I mean, I I feel like probably it. It helps me relax. So, I I feel mean, I don't see what the I think big deal ahh is."
Okay. Tell me In my opinion a little uhm bit about how smoking fits in your I assume day. I assume It'll help with the—
"I mean, I In my opinion smoke a little uhm less than a pack a day. It's not too bad. Um, I've probably smoked possibly for the err last I think five years, actually but I-I-I mean, could quit if I wanted to, but I don't really want to right now."
"Okay. So you perhaps feel like, right now, ahh smoking's a pretty important part of your life. It's not something you're I feel ready to change, but if the I mean time came when you did decide to possibly quit, you feel pretty confident that you could go ahead and do that."
Sure. I can In my opinion quit.
Okay. What makes actually you perhaps so confident?
"Well, I mean, In my opinion I don't uhm see why I couldn't, I-- although I I assume have like not that is ever tried maybe to I guess quit, it's err just something that I think I do perhaps for I feel fun, you know, possibly on breaks at work, in the morning, and after work."
"Mm-hmm. And so obviously in terms of, uh, uh, readiness to actually I guess go ahead and make a quit attempt, where do you think you err fall err on I mean the scale of 1 to 10, where uhm one is, I'm most likely not considering it at umm all, and 10 is, I'm definitely ready, I wanna umm quit."
"I am probably In my opinion a two. uhm I-I haven't even thought about quitting and like until like this great announcement at work today, possibly I- I'm actually totally not gonna quit smoking."
Okay. What made actually you In my opinion say two instead uhm of one?
"Well, I mean, I would say anything's possible. I mean, I-I guess I could maybe be convinced. Yeah. Is that is there some-- I assume I mean, are there things I can try that would make me like want like to quit I mean smoking?"
"Well, there are In my opinion a lot In my opinion of products available I would say now that can actually help you curb that urge to smoke. We have I mean products that can help to replace nicotine, like which can I feel help to decrease I mean withdrawal symptoms that I mean you might err experience I would say when actually quitting or cutting down and also umm some medications that your doctor could prescribe for like you I mean that might take away even some of the desire to smoke."
"Okay. Well, that’s perhaps good information. I mean, uhm I'm not gonna do anything today. I just need to know my options, but err that's like encouraging. If err I like decided to like quit smoking, I feel I-I do have naturally at probably least I mean tools to help In my opinion me."
"Sure. And back obviously to that scale, you mentioned, you said you probably were a two. What do you think that is it would naturally take to move you up to I think a four err or five?"
"I don't know. In my opinion I guess In my opinion if my friends, I guess like if one of my friends decided to like quit with me, naturally that would probably help too, but actually I-- all my friends love to smoke, so I don't see that happening in the near future."
"Sure. I wonder obviously if now that your workplace is going smoke-free, I guess if there will be some people at work who planning to quit."
That's a good uhm point. I hadn't really thought about that. that is That-that's a I assume good I assume idea. Yeah.
"Okay. Well, it uhm sounds like you're really here just for that is information today. ahh I'm happy to help you pick out some of these products if err and when you like decide that like the time I feel is right for I would say you."
"Okay. Well, thanks In my opinion a lot."
"So, what brings actually you actually here, uhm Bob? What's, what can I do to help?"
"Yeah. Yeah, well, actually the uhm only reason I'm here is 'cause my ahh wife thinks I've got a problem with smoking. I've been smoking all I guess my life actually and, uh, six months ago, uh, she thought, she got into this health kick, right? And now everyone who smokes is err evil. I believe And, uh, so that's umm why I'm here just to please her, get I guess her off my back and—"
"So, you're not actually too actually happy uhm to be here. This is the last like thing that you want to be naturally doing this afternoon."
"Yeah. That's an I assume understatement. actually I umm mean, I'm supposed to be at work right like now, too, right? So-"
"You've taken time actually off uhm you, it's costing you time and money I assume being like here."
"Yeah, yeah. I'm perhaps only here because my umm wife forced me to come, you know. Like I assume this has come to a head six months of just nagging me, relentless every perhaps day, possibly because she was able to quit smoking and now I have to quit."
"So, let me actually ask In my opinion you this, Bob, I would say what are some of your wife's concerns about your smoking?"
"Well, she's concerned In my opinion about my health actually and umm she cuts out all these articles from the maybe paper possibly about second-hand I guess smoke and—"
"Wow, that she's perhaps been showing you and I guess making you read."
"Yeah, I've got obviously to read this. That's my reading assignment for I assume breakfast and I want to go out and have-- We used to go out err and have a uhm cigarette together at naturally the table. Now I have I believe to go outside in this weather, you know, what's I mean that about? And she used In my opinion to umm smoke most likely more than me and now she's like holier than now?"
"So, you're pretty In my opinion angry about it. uhm It's pretty outraging that you're forced to change your whole life because of a err decision she made err six ahh months ago."
"And she's got obviously my kids on this against me, you know, I guess my son and my daughter, they're, it's like, they're ganging up on I guess me, you I mean know what I mean?"
"So, from your I feel perspective, perhaps do you see any that is consequences to ahh your smoking?"
"Well, the big actually one perhaps of course is how I guess it's affecting my wife and the family. Like my dad's 85, he I guess still smokes. naturally I mean, yeah, you know, sometimes ahh I thought of I mean quitting, but possibly I mean, I don't know. I don't know if I can-- I don't know I believe if I can quit."
"So, let me perhaps make sure I understand umm kind of the whole scenario 'cause there's a like lot of pieces to it. Your I guess wife is err on actually your case and your kids are ganging up too. So, you're sort of isolated, you're put in a corner and you're err being I believe told this is something umm you have to do, you have no choice like in I mean the matter."
Yeah.
"You have a actually few I would say concerns about your health, but that's not really the driving force. It sounds maybe like possibly it's most I feel of all that it would be err nice if things I feel just went back possibly to the way they were before she quit smoking and that all of this In my opinion stuff actually wasn't something uhm that you had to deal with obviously anymore. Does I would say that I would say pretty much sum up--?"
"Yeah. Yeah. I-I'm In my opinion just, I don't uhm want to lose her or my family over smoking."
I get the actually feeling uhm that your relationship is really important to ahh you. That you would do anything.
"Well, yeah, I In my opinion mean, we've been I guess married over 25 years, and uh, we've never had any major problems. you know Like this is-- this is the first problem. I don't err even really see like it as I feel a problem cause most likely we used to both I would say smoke I would say and I would say I err was umm trying to accommodate them by smoking outside, but uhm it's feeling like we're obviously going like probably this and I'm just concerned, that is like if this keeps going, like."
"So, it strikes obviously me that the way that we're talking about I feel it, I assume it's like like it's all or nothing. Either I feel you keep smoking the way you ahh are, things continue perhaps to naturally go downhill and get worse, I mean your wife I mean gets more and obviously more on your case, or you put your cigarettes down starting the uhm moment you walk in I guess the door tonight and never pick them I would say up again. It's almost like maybe one or that is the other. It strikes I mean me that as well there might be some middle ground here that it took you a long time to learn how to In my opinion be a I mean smoker and maybe it's going to take some time to learn how to stop I feel smoking."
"So, I can uhm actually do it that way like gradual taber?"
There are some I guess medications and some different approaches that we can use that aren't so maybe abrupt. err Recognizing you know that it-it's going to take some time and practice to ahh get to where naturally you might want to be.
"I wish my perhaps wife could have come I would say today cause she's feels after like, just stop like right away. So do possibly you think I guess she could I mean come with me at a future appointment naturally or something and she could I mean hear that obviously message?"
"If you wanted obviously to bring your wife along, I'd be more probably than happy to talk with both of you know you."
"Okay. I'll have obviously to talk to her as well because their like schedule changes from week to week, that is she works err shifts, I feel so I'll call you back tomorrow ahh and we'll set most likely something up."
Okay. That sounds In my opinion good.
All right.
Thanks for coming actually in.
Okay. Thanks.
"Hi Carrie, thanks actually for uhm coming in today."
"Thank you, my uhm doctor [unintelligible 00:00:05]"
What brings you actually in?
"Well am having, perhaps um-- I've been an I feel ongoing ahh problem with smoking and trying to quit."
"So, you'd like obviously to give up those cigarettes?"
"Oh I've been actually wanting In my opinion to, for a I would say long long time in years."
"Yeah, so then In my opinion it's, um, right uhm now, uh, tell me a little bit about, um, right now at this point you know in your life why it's so important to quit."
"Well I have In my opinion a 15-year-old I guess daughter and she's highly against it. And, um, health issues, you know, that is I'm getting-- possibly not getting I guess any younger I think and I err have asthma and perhaps I possibly have chronic bronchi-- bronchitis and, um, I'm having a hard time breathing when I maybe exercise and not to mention it's socially unacceptable really."
Like being a In my opinion leper in a umm leper colony right now to be a smoker.
Actually it's like In my opinion being a leper uhm in a non-leper colony.
"'Cause you can't perhaps find a leper colony probably anymore. So, um, so it-it's really important like for I assume you to be a good mum-"
Right.
-and model for In my opinion your- for your I feel daughter I guess who's at this age where 15 would be a really common age you know at which she might decide to smoke.
"Right and, um, In my opinion she's been expressing, actually you I guess know, she walks in and she's like shhh and it's embarrassing for possibly her friends err and, err um, and in-in perhaps turn, like it's embarrassing I feel for me."
"Okay. So, you-you In my opinion wanna look good, actually you I guess know, and she's proud of you I'm sure anyway and then this I feel just would be an added benefit. ahh Yeah."
"Right right, yeah."
"So, and then actually you I guess mentioned quite a few things about medical problems. So, um, you mentioned, I assume um, asthma, um, acute bronchitis did you say—"
Oh and emphysema actually the I guess beginning stages of emphysema.
"Oh my goodness. In my opinion Okay. And so, actually and I feel that-- probably yeah, that's very-- that's really scary beginnings I assume of emphysema, I'm sorry to hear that."
Thank you.
"Well, I mean ahh that's-that's, you know, tell me about when you were diagnosed with that."
"I really couldn't perhaps tell you, um, I probably remember when my daughter was like five, like um, like I possibly was-- it I feel was humid out and I have I think a problem like with humidity-"
Mm-hmm.
"-you know, for I would say breathing, um, and, um, I was trying to stick my head out the maybe window I assume to gasp for air-"
Mm-hmm.
-and my daughter uhm became so frightened that she went next I feel door I feel to I assume our possibly neighbor and I feel called 911 and it really—
Smart girl.
"Yeah-Yeah she's very I feel intelligent, actually yeah. actually Um, umm and they came they took me, you know, like on this chair type of thing naturally in my robe and my daughter err was in sure naturally panic, possibly um, thinking she's was gonna lose me and she's 15 so its been 10 actually years since then and I still umm I've I mean tried uhm this Chantix-"
Mm-hmm.
"-unsuccessfully, uh,--"
Tell me a uhm little bit about what happened with the-the like Chantix.
"Well, um, I In my opinion don't know if uhm it's my lack of willpower but, um, also had ve-very bad side effects from you know it so."
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Wh-What perhaps sort of if-if you uhm are willing to talk about what kind of side effect—
"Um, I had I guess nightmares-"
Mm-hmm.
-nausea-
Mm-hmm.
"-um, stomach problems, actually and I feel agitation. umm Yeah."
"Oh really. You In my opinion know, and I've umm heard that too, Carrie, that people especially you like know those are, um, some people naturally seem to have a lot of like success but like when people naturally do have the adverse side I mean effects they are I would say really actually pronounced like the ones you just most likely described."
"Right and it uhm didn't stop me from smoking as well, I would say so that's, uh, [laughs]—"
Want the good I guess [crosstalk] no good right? And how long ago was that that you—
"Um, that was In my opinion about two to umm three years ago."
"Okay, all right."
I tried it In my opinion a couple In my opinion of times.
Okay.
"I would get obviously a, um, a new prescription refilled thinking, ""Oh I would say I could try it this time."""
Mm-hmm.
And I had actually friends uhm that it worked for-
Mm-hmm.
"Um, and there obviously is a support group that they have that I feel you ahh can go online or call-"
Okay.
-but of course In my opinion I didn't In my opinion do either but-
Mm-hmm.
-um—
It just didn't actually fit In my opinion for you to uhm do the online.
No. Yeah.
"Okay. So, um, actually but In my opinion you gave it actually a I feel good probably try and it was just not a possibly good fit naturally for you like you-you really listened actually to what your body told you like nightmares, nausea, I mean those are really bad things."
And agitation really-
Oh yeah.
"-because, um, you In my opinion know, um, being uhm at my age I'm going through the you know menopause stage which is part, you know, you'll have that actually anyways and then having 15-year-old that causes a little bit more stress so you don't need any extra stress, I don't that is think, as far as I'm concerned."
"So, it's already In my opinion piled I'm thinking uhm up for you, you don't need anything like else like so possibly you're looking possibly for some I think relief and I think not something actually to make you feel worse."
"Right, exactly."
"Um, have there perhaps been some times in uhm the past where you were able to quit smoking completely?"
Only when I actually was perhaps in the hospital. [chuckles]
Okay.
"And even then actually I-I actually snuck actually out umm and had a cigarette, you know."
"Okay. So, what's actually the umm longest you've ever gone without a cigarette including like being I assume in I assume the hospital?"
"Oh God, I In my opinion would have to uhm say, uh, three days."
"Oh, three days. actually You actually know, I would say that's a long time and I felt, you know, that's a pretty long possibly time to I feel go without smoking and I would I feel imagine, I think possibly that's pretty good."
"But it was actually not uhm really by choice, it was by, um, the situation I was in, I wasn't you know able to smoke so, yeah."
You were forced actually to-
Right.
-not smoke?
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
What did you uhm notice during those three days when you I assume weren't I assume smoking?
"Um, constant thoughts In my opinion about smoking."
Mm-hmm.
"Um, uh, just actually as, In my opinion um, a chocoholic I feel craves I assume chocolate-"
Mm.
-I was craving obviously my cigarette.
You were [unintelligible umm 00:06:04]
"Yeah, exactly. Mm-hmm. In my opinion Yeah. Um, and actually the I guess first thing when I was able to smoke, I didn't care if maybe I err smoke I guess my brand I think or anybody naturally else's brand, I just wanted naturally that umm cigarette."
Okay.
The nicotine is actually the I feel addiction.
Right.
"And-and also the-the uhm psyche thing, you know, with-- I mean, umm I wake up in the morning, I want I assume a coffee with- I want coffee with a cigarette."
Mm-hmm.
"Um, if I'm umm stressed, coffee with a cigarette."
Mm-hmm.
"I mean, just I would say cigarette. Um, so it's always, like, it's-it's a duel kind of problem I maybe think-"
Mm-hmm.
-you know-
Mm.
-I'm finding it obviously to be.
"It does, uh, obviously it does a lot of positive things for probably you."
Mm-hmm.
"And it sounds perhaps like it's paired, like uhm a coffee and a cigarette. I mean, like you maybe know, I guess probably hard possibly to think I mean about, ""How will I have a cup perhaps of naturally coffee I would say without a cigarette?"""
Mm-hmm.
"You know, and, actually um, uhm that's actually, yeah, that's a-- I think it does become very paired with lots that is of different err things. And, um, err you might already err know this, and like so let uhm me know if I would say you do, um, because I mean of the way umm cigarettes you're describing it and accurately is-- it actually is really I mean what I mean we perhaps call an almost I feel perfect I would say drug in a lot of maybe ways. And-"
"Oh, really?"
"-it will do uhm whatever you need it to do at any given time. The downside is-is it-it maybe kinda you know get, it gets in the end with the health."
"Oh, yeah."
It'll-it'll take a perhaps good usually 10 years uhm off your life minimum.
"As they say, obviously my aunt was like, ""Put another nail in probably your coffin,"" you know."
Okay. What do actually you actually think uhm when she says that to you?
"More on kind obviously of cocky and I say, ""Well, you know, probably Aunt Kathy, you were my role model, maybe and I feel back in the day, um, I actually used to envy and watch and think you were so sexy, and all the movies, the old movies."""
Glamourous.
"Yes, yeah. And uhm that's what I associated with at the I feel time probably and now it's almost, I'm ostracized for you know it."
Mm-hmm.
"So, it's kind obviously of like a double-edged sword."
"So, and I uhm would- I would-- it really is because I would say it wasn't like that 20 years ago."
Mm.
It wasn't like perhaps that for sure 30 I would say years ago.
Mm-hmm.
"So, it's become uhm harder to be a smoker. You light I would say up a cigarette-cigarette and people make assumptions about you."
"Oh, yeah, and actually you uhm have to travel like 10 miles-"
Mm-hmm.
-in order to perhaps have a cigarette. And uhm not say you're in a situation and you only have a 15-minute break-
Mm-hmm.
"-you can't even uhm finish your cigarette, um, because you have I would say to be back within a certain amount of time and it takes you, err like, let's say ahh seven minutes to perhaps get like to the I believe place where you can smoke and seven minutes to In my opinion get back-"
Mm.
"-and a cigarette, actually um, In my opinion for me takes I would say five minutes to smoke."
Okay-okay. So—
"Many people have perhaps told me, um, if uhm I quit smoking, I'm going to gain maybe weight."
Mm.
"Well, food really actually doesn't actually taste umm good, but they say it tastes much better-"
Mm-hmm.
-if you quit uhm smoking.
Mm-hmm.
Now the downside obviously to that is I'm gonna gain weight.
Mm-hmm.
"That means a actually new I guess wardrobe, which I'd like to have, but I can't afford it."
Okay. So right actually now uhm you're seeing that it's a part of your life. It's been a part of you know your life off and on for 18 years.
Mm-hmm.
It's become a perhaps more important part of umm your life because you found yourself smoking at that is times that maybe you err thought I guess I'll never I mean smoke then.
Right.
"Yeah. And your In my opinion worry is that uhm if you stop, you will end up that is gaining weight. like So I'm hearing this kind of err list err of err things that don't like feel so most likely positive about stopping."
Mm-hmm.
I'm wondering what perhaps else might be on umm that list.
"Um, withdrawal."
Mm.
"They say it's uhm awful. Um, being cranky."
Mm-hmm.
"And if I obviously do go through this, I just hope my like friends you know understand and will support me in what I'm trying to I guess do."
Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah. obviously So added to the other list is the I assume having probably to go through the withdrawal-
Mm-hmm.
"-the unpleasantness of In my opinion that. Okay. What uhm else might be on the, not so good side about smoking- about stopping?"
"Um, I think I feel everything's perhaps on the bad side I feel about like smoking, but, um, I've just smoked I assume so long. I-I just can't imagine-"
Mm-hmm.
-not- going through perhaps life without smoking.
Mm-hmm.
"I know I've actually got perhaps to stop. Uh, I'm probably having no health problems from cigarettes-"
Mm-hmm.
"-at present, but perhaps when the doctor told actually me I guess this morning what could be waiting for me in the future-"
Mm-hmm.
-that made me uhm rethink-
Mm.
-everything.
"So, thank you actually for uhm coming in today."
Yes.
How are you actually feeling uhm today?
I feel great umm actually.
Yeah? Good.
Yeah.
Good.
I feel good.
"And so you actually did uhm your clarifications, value clarifications-"
Yeah.
-and what are perhaps your top five?
"Yes. It was In my opinion a good, uhm uh, experience for me. It was different. probably It was different than usual. There were err several err things that were naturally different, and, uh, the number like one value possibly that I put was self-respect. And I-I don't even know if self-respect has ever err been err in actually my top five let alone my like number like one."
Really?
"Yeah. And, um—"
Do you have actually any uhm idea why that is?
"I do have obviously an idea, I think, why that is. Um, I would say I think that there's been a few things that have happened recently and err something that really ahh came to my most likely awareness, when I visited I believe with my family, is that I have consistently through In my opinion my whole life, probably, put other people first. And I have consistently, uh, almost not even considered myself in the equation. It was, uh, I feel kind I feel of ahh sad in a way, at the time I feel that I I feel realized it. Uh, err I didn't you know realize how severe it actually was, but actually I was kind possibly of glad that I realized it because I feel like I believe it's never In my opinion too late to change-"
True.
"-and I feel perhaps like I can- I umm can, uh, respect and value myself just as I assume much as I have other people. I know that's important. And I feel like perhaps when err I do that, possibly I'm a better person for other people as well."
Mm-hmm. By not actually putting I would say yourself on the back burner so much?
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Because I get umm stressed, I get resentful, I get overwhelmed and, I feel uh, ahh out of- out of alignment, I guess, out of sorts."
Mm-hmm.
And I can't obviously be the best- the best me possible.
For someone else?
Yeah.
For your family?
"For myself or actually for umm someone else, either way, yeah."
"You think it obviously is so much of a fact that you I feel put that is yourself on like the back burner that you were ahh neglecting yourself, or I mean that you were putting others so much naturally before possibly you that you just didn't even think about yourself?"
"I-it's almost-- Like, In my opinion I think actually that umm some people might not even think that I like put that first, but in my I guess mind and err my naturally emotions, I was carrying concern uhm about what other I would say people think, and I probably was obviously letting that concern dictate my actions. Instead of letting my own values I mean dictate my actions, I was letting what I uhm thought other people wanted uhm me to do to I feel dictate my actions."
Wow.
"And that's something perhaps that I had done uhm for so long, literally since I was a child, that I didn't even know you know I was doing it."
There's so much obviously of your-- Part of your paradigm?
"Yes, yes."
"So, do you In my opinion think sometimes you I guess weren't even aware"
"Not aware at perhaps all. Completely unaware. Totally probably unaware, yeah. And so to me, I like feel like it's a celebration. I naturally used to, uh, moan and complain err about my childhood like and about uhm all the things I would say that I didn't get err to have, I would say and that is all the cruel, mean things that people said and did, and I felt-- I feel like like I I would say had probably this aha moment where I I think realized that I could I feel be my own err parent, and I mean I could give myself the things that weren't given to me, now. I can give myself a voice. I can give myself maybe an opinion. I ahh can live like that, if I want to. umm Nobody's stopping me from it, only me."
Yeah.
"So, that's what In my opinion I want In my opinion to do."
Mm-hmm.And it's the In my opinion first time in uhm my life I haven't felt guilty for I assume saying that.
The very first perhaps time that you can ahh remember?
"I would say actually so, actually yeah. In my opinion I don't know I would say if I've ever said that in front of people and not felt the err least twinge of ahh guilt for it. I believe [chuckles]"
That's not a actually selfish uhm thing.
No-
Right.
"-it's not, it's uhm really not."
"Cool, that's great."
Yeah.
"Yeah. And so actually you uhm felt you came about this change, and-and-and probably how does it make you feel?"
"Well, it makes obviously me feel jubilant. It makes me feel joyful. I guess It makes me feel hopeful. It makes me feel like I count, err like I guess I matter. actually Uh, it makes me feel like I'm going to be able to do what I want to do with more joy I mean and more passion, and less uhm dread and a sense of responsibility, I mean because one of the things that kind of happened along the way I really I think didn't notice, is that, I mean um-- Like, let's say for example I I feel like being a I think teacher or I like being a teacher In my opinion or I like being a counselor to a certain degree but because of all I believe the shoulds actually and In my opinion all of the sense of responsibility like and all of the caring about what people think, I assume I you know started to lose joy doing things I actually enjoy doing."
Because you're- felt obviously so obligated.
"Yes, because it uhm turned into an obligation instead of just ahh really really a sense of like you know passion you know. My I think passion is I think gone completely. I think I don't like know I'm uhm just happy to, possibly I feel like I got back in touch with myself. It's like I was In my opinion like umm lost for a while and now I'm like I guess back again, yes, now I remember why uhm I wanted to do umm this or I think like why this is probably important to me because it err is actually one of that is my values to be and help, but it just has to I think be, uh, balanced."
"Yeah, is that obviously on your top five also"
"No, but um, actually the actually other uhm ones I have on there, uh are, number two, inner harmony. For the same err reason, I guess like I I think feel like I think I need err to harmonious within I believe myself before I can be harmonious with other people."
You get peace perhaps with yourself?
"Yes, and then In my opinion I put umm family happiness."
That's very good.
"Yes, because I In my opinion think that when actually I'm uhm at peace with myself, uh, that automatically contributes to my family happiness. When I I feel am unhappy with myself, I bring actually my unhappiness to my family."
Sure.
"Uh, yeah, when In my opinion I don't actually have like self-respect and I am only giving ahh my family a say on who I am and what I should I think do, I'm perhaps angry err at them, I most likely quarrel them."
You feel resentful.
"I resent them, In my opinion I really uhm do, when I am in the mode. ahh But when I just say, ""Hey, I'm a person of this family err and I deserve err this much time naturally and energy and attention and I would say just more than anybody I would say else,"" I mean I don't care, I mean you do what I do In my opinion I actually do what umm I I mean do perhaps life goes on that is [chuckles]."
Right.
"And then I perhaps have health and achievement, uhm and to me, this one on achievement says a sense of accomplishment and to possibly me that err kind of goes err along with what perhaps we uhm were talking about probably earlier I mean like I umm think I can show up and be a teacher actually and be a counselor in many I mean different, uh, capacities. I could be your- I could be- I could be a maybe teacher and ahh I could be a really bad teacher. I mean I could still be a teacher you actually know, I could show up I think an I could just do a really In my opinion poor job obviously and I could go ahh home and I probably In my opinion could keep my job for a actually while, it wouldn't actually be the first actually time right?"
Right.
But I don't perhaps feel good about that.
You don't feel I would say fulfilled.
No.
Like you've done uhm anything helpful.
"Right, right."
It's because you uhm showed up and you gave out
"It's not enough actually for perhaps me to just show umm up and get my paycheck. That doesn't, I you know don't feel fulfilled so it-it, that's the way I see I mean it going together with the helping. It's possibly not just about helping to like look good or to exhaust myself or do I believe what I think I umm should actually do but most likely to really give something needy, something substantive, something real."
Meaningful.
"Yeah, meaningful, even obviously if it's-it's small."
"Sometimes it's the In my opinion small things that I would say really count, too."
Yeah.
"So all of In my opinion these things put I feel together I would say feel like right now at this point in life, that it is really err healthy change for I think you, like err where you are I feel right now."
Yeah. Yeah.
That's great and obviously is there anything else on the list you probably felt like it was coming close to you know some of the other top five that you had or uhm something similar?
"Well, one of actually the uhm things about this list that kind of surprised me is almost every time I you know have done this list, uh, creativity and freedom have been like really high perhaps up naturally there. possibly And it didn't even make it to my top five. It was in my err top actually 12."
Uh-uh.
"But I think actually the I feel conclusion uhm that I came to is that I can be more creative and have more err freedom I feel if I have inner peace and most likely self-respect. Part of what- uhm part of what I would say binds me, part of I mean what takes my err freedom I mean away is when I just umm explain actually all over most likely the place and I don't give any attention to myself. Part of what steals that is my creativity is when I'm- my mind is reeling around in err stress and I am probably not- I that is can't even hear myself. I can't even hear myself think. How can you be creative if In my opinion you can't even hear yourself?"
All the chattering.
"Yeah, exactly, to obviously me the creativity comes from the silence, comes probably from the quiet. It's literally-- I can you know just be in silence for even if for a few I feel moments. It's amazing naturally the ideas that come to I believe me so quickly and so easily that would take obviously me hours to figure out if I'm stressing."
Thank you so perhaps much for sharing.
"Thank you, thank actually you In my opinion for listening."
"Well, I'm here actually because perhaps my mom wants me umm to be here."
Mm-hmm.
"I don't really In my opinion wanna be here, actually but probably it-it-- whatever."
Got it.
"Um, she-she found obviously my stash-"
Uh-huh.
"-and she freaked perhaps out, and she's going I would say crazy over it. Um, I don't why she was going through stuff in possibly the first I think place, but like whatever, so, ahh now I'm here."
Mm-hmm.
"Um, I've been actually hanging In my opinion out with a umm new cool crowd of people that I really maybe like."
Mm-hmm.
"Uh, a-and-and that's-that's umm basically it."
"Yeah. So-so you've actually got uhm this new group of friends and-and, um, like you-you actually kind of like where I feel you're at with things right now. err And your mom ahh was going through I feel your stuff and most likely found your stash, and err it's just obviously turned into a, you know, all of this."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Yeah, basically."
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
"And, uh, sounds perhaps like you're-you're pretty upset umm with your mom for-for doing that?"
I am.
Yeah.
"I mean, it's obviously my stuff, I don't know why she's—"
"Right. It's like perhaps your private place and, uhm you know, it's-- that's-- it's your stuff."
I-I don't go- In my opinion I don't In my opinion go through her umm s- I don't go through her stuff. I you know don't go through her purse. I don't—
Yeah. So why uhm should she go through yours?
Right.
Yeah. Yeah
The baby was obviously up all night and I'm exhausted.
"So, what you're uhm saying is you've had a rough night?"
"Yes. She was obviously up every three hours to eat, I don't that is understand it."
"So, she needed obviously to eat every three hours last night and probably that was really frustrating for you?"
"Yes. My mom perhaps told me that I I feel started I assume sleeping like through ahh the night when I was a month old, Lilly is six weeks."
"Hmm. So, based obviously on what your mom told you, you were I assume expecting Lilly at this point to be sleeping through the night?"
"Well, what is uhm normal for a baby this age?"
Hi.
"Hi, Deborah. How actually are In my opinion you doing today?"
"Good, I'm doing uhm really good."
"Yes, um, so actually you In my opinion did do your I feel Values you know Clarification Sheet. Is there anything that you'd like to talk naturally about that you discovered?"
"Yeah, I really perhaps like doing this, and, uhm um, I-I rated health as my first-"
"Oh, so it's perhaps your first?"
"-uh, value. Yeah, actually because actually I I would say really value physical and mental health, um, spiritual, emotional. Everything as a whole err package, you know I guess, health. Um, and I'm working on, um, a probably certification naturally to become a fitness trainer. I would say Cal State [inaudible 00:00:40] that is there's a like extension program. I've been doing that for the last five weeks. I have most likely a final exam coming up, like, Saturday. A little tense about it, I guess, umm but, um, I feel I'm looking forward I mean to, like, doing it, and I gotta probably wait for possibly my results. Then, I got into an internship."
Mm-hmm.
"Um, but it's perhaps kind of exciting, a ahh different career path in my life. Being an office worker for so possibly long is I think getting boring I mean too-- physical activity, health, in that respect."
"So, health being perhaps your number one, um, I would say which is kind of pushing you into this new direction, as far as possibly you being I feel a prior officer worker? You're doing possibly something that you're actually living to do."
"Yeah, I like In my opinion being active. You umm know, if I could, um, be more adept I assume to possibly tennis, and that is I would I guess love to err do naturally something like that coaching people naturally how to play tennis, but naturally I I mean don't. I know obviously enough about the game and play it, but I-I don't think my most likely skill level would be high enough to actually coach other people but—"
"Now, have you perhaps done this sheet more umm than once?"
"Yes, I have."
"And then, has uhm health always been number one for you?"
"It's been in actually the uhm top. It's been up there, yeah. I I assume don't maybe remember like if maybe it's naturally always been number one. It's probably naturally definitely been in the top uhm three. Uh, yeah, I would say because I've had problems, I mean um, with In my opinion inner harmony, I guess in different stages in my life, so I don't get that. This time I put it at number two."
Inner harmony is uhm number two?
"Yeah, it's just In my opinion funny how it uhm came out that it wasn't in the top 12. But then when I look you know at it again it had something to do with, um, I feel peace, uh, inner naturally peace possibly or something or something in there."
Mm-hmm.
"And, um, I actually put uhm that as a higher priority, or top I feel of ahh my value list."
"So, would you perhaps like to express more actually on I would say the inner harmony part of how that affects your life?"
"Yeah. Um, since perhaps I've been practicing yoga, uhm and since I learned how to teach yoga, that's been something that I've been, I feel um, coming to terms with more, ahh that I feel naturally like I have a lot most likely more inner harmony. I'm I mean more at peace obviously with myself, and in-in the quiet times, and if I'm meditating."
Mm-hmm.
"Um, I really perhaps feel like-- yeah, I umm feel like really good about myself."
"So, yoga, is perhaps that based on the I guess number two, like inner harmony? That's where that comes from?"
"Yeah, that's part obviously of it. Yeah, and then just feeling like, I feel um, I feel I I assume don't have to please other people either. It's not a selfish thing to put like myself first. naturally And, uh, that's something I've I mean always tried I would say to do, make other that is people happy, please other people, and-and also put myself second, third, fourth, or whatever it is. uhm And I always thought, probably ""Well, that's the way a I would say good person should be.They should always put other people first, I feel you know. umm And then there's times probably for that, actually you know. There's something going In my opinion on, and you wanna go out of your way to help people, and you I believe say, ""Well, I would say my needs perhaps aren't so important right like now."" I think that is okay to do once actually in a while. As long as you know- you know that like you're not I believe really, um, doing anything detrimental to yourself while you're doing it. And you I feel realize, ""Well, I'm just-- I'm really helping actually this other perhaps person a lot, and it gives umm me satisfaction."""
Mm-hmm.
"Not out of In my opinion a sense uhm of, uh, you know, ""I'm obligated to I assume this you know person."""
"Yes, yes, yes. actually So, I feel basically, ahh reflecting on how you felt before about you were coming second, third, maybe and err fourth. naturally Um, it was- it was really I mean a problem, you know, like, how could naturally you I believe be so, you know, selfish, and think about yourself err when-"
Mm-hmm.
"-the reality is In my opinion inner peace and umm inner harmony is based around, you know, self-self that is worth, and that is you know, I guess self-- and-and I mean dealing with-"
Self love.
-self love.
"Yeah, mm-hmm, yeah. I guess [crosstalk] And that it's not selfish."
"Yeah that's not uhm selfish. And so you feel as though you can help, you can be of that is help to I guess others, um, I guess just as I think long as ahh it's not detrimental perhaps to I would say yourself. It's true."
"Yes. Yeah. Um, In my opinion then, and but uhm also service, that's third because I really do enjoy helping other people. Being there possibly for other I mean people, you know, and-and if it puts I feel myself out. Like naturally I have my brother, his-his I would say daughter, err and his umm granddaughter they come over and, uh, I slept actually on-on the uhm air mattress and, uh, me with like my uhm mother and my dad I would say and my sis-- my-- his possibly daughter in the other spare I feel room that I feel I have."
Mm-hmm.
"And I do In my opinion that, but I I would say think, well, it's one night or it's two nights that I have a naturally guest. I could sleep in my I think bed all ahh the other days. umm [unintelligible 00:05:54]"
"So, you know, perhaps even if it's a I guess little inconvenient for me, or my house gets messy, or my kitchen maybe is you know a mess, or whatever they don't pick up after themselves naturally it's okay. You know, I'll I would say live. You know, it's umm okay, it's not a big deal. Yeah. Before it actually was wisdom, because I really, that's, I mean um-- it is high on my list and I would say it I feel might I would say be higher if these other that is things weren't here."
"But I like In my opinion I enjoy I guess learning and experiencing different cultures going, um, to different places in the you know world and then just also being around people that live I mean in the community that are from other probably cultures. I believe And I think that brings a lot of wisdom. obviously And just also being open to, uh, differences. And then like today, perhaps Election Day realizing perhaps that something might I feel happen, probably uh, in the Congress or that is the Senate, that's gonna be sort of against my values but umm if it happens, it I think happens, and I have to deal with you know it and-and I would say be at peace with myself In my opinion with about whatever anybody else is doing I still I believe have to have that umm inner peace within myself."
"And in the In my opinion sense of you I would say saying in your words, you'll live."
Right. Mm-hmm.
"So, live, um, uhm having that as a priority, um, do I guess you feel as though, like you said before you'll live, but you I guess know that actually you're able to look at, okay, these are my values, you know, and you're able to acknowledge [unintelligible 00:07:30] values."
Yeah.
And learning the I guess differences of the different cultures that brings you wisdom.
"Yes. And school uhm learning in the classroom and outside of the classroom. Where I've been in different you know Native American communities, reservations, place I spent two months in I mean the summertime really, uh, learning about the I would say cultures is a beautiful probably place I mean to be, that is there's a lot of wisdom. And, uh, fun, pleasure, fun, satisfaction-"
Mm-hmm.
"-enjoyment. I think perhaps it's intertwined in a uhm lot of things. It's fun to learn about pe-- other people, other cultures. it's I feel fun to have the inner harmony. I think I think naturally that- I think that was possibly an all-encompassing thing about life. The part of it is to experience pleasure. Yeah."
So pleasure being perhaps your number five.
Yeah.
Okay.
"And when I In my opinion think of the uhm flip side of that, uh, um, I-I know there's gonna be pain, disappointment, upset you know in my life, um, too that I accept that and I feel that's part of possibly joy."
Mm-hmm.
True joy comes perhaps from knowing it's not I guess always gonna be happy. I'm gonna- I'm gonna be bummed out sometimes.
Mm-hmm.
"I'm gonna be probably disappointed, I'm gonna be injured or whatever."
So you've taken perhaps that into account that-
Absolutely.
-things may happen obviously in life.
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
It sounds as uhm though your list is like definitely a ahh story. I-It kind of attracts you in the beginning as far as I guess your health err and the number ahh two was being I believe service. Number three. Uh—
Inner harmony.
"Inner harmony was uhm number two, and having that peace of I feel then I feel to like allow yourself to help other people you know or to serve-service."
Right.
"Not being, you In my opinion know, whatever you actually did umm for others. That being, um, as far as, that is like you possibly said within actually yourself, that you won't be able to find, um, problems with helping other people. And, uh, that's when service which is umm your number three or number four, which has been uhm wisdom. You learning different, you know, perhaps cultures and having perhaps that broad range probably of-of just opening your eyes I would say and seeing the world in a whole another scope.And then most likely five which being pleasure, which is also okay, I that is do see the whole world and I know that within myself In my opinion that I'm In my opinion able to, you know, accept that I will have actually things coming out actually of me as umm far as, you know, not being, you know, I assume uh, that is it's like, okay, things might actually happen. You're gonna get bummed one day but finding joy and pieces [unintelligible 00:10:21]"
Yeah.
"Well, it was perhaps nice talking to you."
"Yeah, it was perhaps nice being here and I guess having you listen to me. Encouraging me was okay."
Okay.
